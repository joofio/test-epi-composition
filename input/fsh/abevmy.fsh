  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Abevmy contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a 
type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection 
and cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF 
protein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with 
nutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking 
the growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. </p>
<p>Abevmy is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large 
bowel, i.e., in the colon or rectum. Abevmy will be administered in combination with chemotherapy 
treatment containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine. </p>
<p>Abevmy is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for 
patients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called 
paclitaxel or capecitabine. </p>
<p>Abevmy is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
Abevmy will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. </p>
<p>Abevmy is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer when 
cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
Abevmy will be administered in combination with erlotinib. </p>
<p>Abevmy is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for 
patients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. </p>
<p>Abevmy is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. </p>
<p>When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Abevmy will be administered in 
combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. </p>
<p>When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Abevmy will be administered in 
combination with paclitaxel, or topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. </p>
<p>Abevmy is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer. Abevmy will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, 
paclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>you are allergic (hypersensitive) to bevacizumab or to any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
<li>you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell products or to other 
recombinant human or humanised antibodies. </li>
<li>you are pregnant. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Abevmy:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible that Abevmy may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you have 
conditions causing inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, colitis 
associated with chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor. </li>
<li>Abevmy may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway between 
two organs or vessels. The risk of developing connections between the vagina and any parts of 
the gut can increase if you have persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. </li>
<li>This medicine can increase the risk of bleeding or increase the risk of problems with wound 
healing after surgery. If you are going to have an operation, if you have had major surgery 
within the last 28 days or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery, you should not 
receive this medicine. </li>
<li>Abevmy may increase the risk of developing serious infections of the skin or deeper layers 
under the skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing. </li>
<li>Abevmy can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure 
which is not well controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your doctor as it is 
important to make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting Abevmy 
treatment. </li>
<li>If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. </li>
<li>This medicine increases the risk of having protein in your urine especially if you already have 
high blood pressure. </li>
<li>The risk of developing blood clots in your arteries (a type of blood vessel) can increase if you 
are over 65 years old, if you have diabetes, or if you have had previous blood clots in your 
arteries. Please talk to your doctor since blood clots can lead to heart attack and stroke. </li>
<li>
<p>Abevmy can also increase the risk of developing blood clots in your veins (a type of blood 
vessel). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This medicine may cause bleeding, especially tumour-related bleeding. Please consult your 
doctor if you or your family tend to suffer from bleeding problems or you are taking medicines 
to thin the blood for any reason. </p>
</li>
<li>It is possible that Abevmy may cause bleeding in and around your brain. Please discuss this 
with your doctor if you have metastatic cancer affecting your brain. </li>
<li>It is possible that Abevmy can increase the risk of bleeding in your lungs, including coughing or 
spitting blood. Please discuss with your doctor if you noticed this previously. </li>
<li>Abevmy can increase the risk of developing a weak heart. It is important that your doctor knows 
if you have ever received anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin, a specific type of 
chemotherapy used to treat some cancers) or had radiotherapy to your chest, or if you have heart 
disease. </li>
<li>This medicine may cause infections and a decreased number of your neutrophils (a type of 
blood cell important for your protection against bacteria). </li>
<li>It is possible that Abevmy can cause hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic shock) and/or 
infusion reactions (reactions related to your injection of the medicine). Please let your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse know if you have previously experienced problems after injections, such as 
dizziness/feeling of fainting, breathlessness, swelling or skin rash. </li>
<li>
<p>A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
has been associated with Abevmy treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, confusion or 
seizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor. 
Please consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past. 
Before you are given Abevmy or while you are being treated with Abevmy:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, 
numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your doctor and 
dentist immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you 
are being treated with Abevmy, in particular when you are also receiving or have received an 
injection of bisphosphonate into your blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>You may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with Abevmy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Abevmy use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the 
safety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations. </p>
<p>Death of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw have been reported in patients under 
18 years old when treated with Abevmy. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Abevmy 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Combinations of Abevmy with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and 
gastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you 
do not combine these medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast 
cancer. These therapies in combination with Abevmy may increase the risk of severe side effects. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. Abevmy may cause damage to your unborn baby 
as it may stop the formation of new blood vessels. Your doctor should advise you about using 
contraception during treatment with Abevmy and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Abevmy. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straightaway if you are pregnant, become pregnant during treatment with this 
medicine, or plan to become pregnant in the near future. </p>
<p>You must not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Abevmy and for at least 6 months after the 
last dose of Abevmy, as this medicine may interfere with the growth and development of your baby. </p>
<p>Abevmy may impair female fertility. Please consult your doctor for more information. 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Abevmy has not been shown to reduce your ability to drive or to use any tools or machines. However, 
sleepiness and fainting have been reported with Abevmy use. If you experience symptoms that affect 
your vision or concentration, or your ability to react, do not drive and use machines until symptoms 
disappear. </p>
<p>Abevmy contains sodium. 
This medicine contains 4.196 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 4 mL vial. 
This is equivalent to 0.21% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>

Abevmy is a concentrate for solution for infusion. Depending on the dose prescribed for you, some or 
all of the contents of the Abevmy vial will be diluted with sodium chloride solution before use. A 
doctor or nurse will give you this diluted Abevmy solution by intravenous infusion (a drip into your 
vein). The first infusion will be given to you over 90 minutes. If this is well-tolerated the second 
infusion may be given over 60 minutes. Later infusions may be given to you over 30 minutes. </p>
<p>The administration of Abevmy should be temporarily discontinued 
- if you develop severe high blood pressure requiring treatment with blood pressure medicines, 
- if you have problems with wound healing following surgery, 
- if you undergo surgery. </p>
<p>The administration of Abevmy should be permanently discontinued if you develop 
- severe high blood pressure which cannot be controlled by blood pressure medicines; or a sudden 
severe rise in blood pressure,

<ul>
<li>Infection or inflammation of the eye globe, </li>
<li>Redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain, </li>
<li>Seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision, </li>
<li>Increased eye pressure, </li>
<li>Bleeding in the eye. </li>
