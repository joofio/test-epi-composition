<ul>
<li>an acutely agitated state or a severely psychotic state </li>
<li>heart problems or have a history of stroke, especially if you know that you have other risks 
factors for stroke </li>
<li>high blood sugar (characterised by symptoms such as excessive thirst, passing of large amounts 
of urine, increase in appetite and feeling weak) or family history of diabetes </li>
<li>fits (seizures) since your doctor may want to monitor you more closely </li>
<li>involuntary, irregular muscle movements, especially in the face </li>
<li>experience a combination of fever, sweating, faster breathing, muscle stiffness and drowsiness 
or sleepiness (may be signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome) </li>
<li>dementia (loss of memory and other mental abilities) especially if you are elderly </li>
<li>cardiovascular diseases (diseases of the heart and circulation), family history of cardiovascular 
disease, stroke or "mini" stroke, abnormal blood pressure </li>
<li>irregular heart beat or if someone else in your family has a history of irregular heart beat 
(including so called QT prolongation seen with ECG monitoring). </li>
<li>blood clots, or family history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been associated with 
formation of blood clots </li>
<li>have any difficulty in swallowing </li>
<li>past experience with excessive gambling </li>

</ul>
<p>If you notice you are gaining weight, develop unusual movements, experience sleepiness that

talk to your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to 
behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry 
out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and 
can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high 
sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. 
Your doctor may need to adjust or stop your dose. </p>
<p>Aripiprazole may cause sleepiness, fall in blood pressure when standing up, dizziness and changes in 
your ability to move and balance, which may lead to falls. Caution should be taken, particularly if you 
are an elderly patient or have some debility. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not use this medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. It is not known if it is safe 
and effective in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Abilify Maintena 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Blood pressure-lowering medicines: Abilify Maintena may increase the effect of medicines used to 
lower the blood pressure. Be sure to tell your doctor if you take a medicine to keep your blood 
pressure under control. </p>
<p>Receiving Abilify Maintena with some medicines may mean the doctor will need to change your dose 
of Abilify Maintena or the other medicines. It is especially important to mention the following to your 
doctor: </p>
<ul>
<li>medicines to correct heart rhythm (such as quinidine, amiodarone, flecainide) </li>
<li>antidepressants or herbal remedy used to treat depression and anxiety (such as fluoxetine, 
paroxetine, St. John's Wort) </li>

e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) </li>
<li>anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) </li>
<li>certain antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis (rifabutin, rifampicin) </li>
<li>medicines that are known to prolong QT prolongation. </li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines may increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effect of Abilify Maintena; if you 
get any unusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with Abilify Maintena, you should 
see your doctor. </p>
<p>Medicines that increase the level of serotonin are typically used in conditions including depression, 
generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia as well as 
migraine and pain: </p>
<ul>
<li>triptans, tramadol and tryptophan used for conditions including depression, generalised anxiety 
disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia as well as migraine and pain </li>
<li>SSRI s (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine) used for depression, OCD, panic and anxiety </li>

<li>St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) used as a herbal remedy for mild depression </li>
<li>painkillers (such as tramadol and pethidine) used for pain relief </li>
<li>triptans (such as sumatriptan and zolmitripitan) used for treating migraine. </li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines may increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking any of 
these medicines together with Abilify Maintena, you should see your doctor. </p>

Maintena in the last trimester (last three months of their pregnancy):

feeding. </p>
<p>If your baby develops any of these symptoms you need to contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are receiving Abilify Maintena, your doctor will discuss with you whether you should breast-
feed considering the benefit to you of your therapy and the benefit to your baby of breast-feeding. You 
should not do both. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you are receiving 
Abilify Maintena. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines
