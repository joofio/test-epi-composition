adult men that has spread to other parts of the body. Abiraterone Krka stops your body from making 
testosterone; this can slow the growth of prostate cancer.
When Abiraterone Krka is prescribed for the early stage of disease where it is still responding to 
hormone therapy, it is used with a treatment that lowers testosterone (androgen deprivation therapy).
When you take this medicine your doctor will also prescribe another medicine called prednisone or 
prednisolone. This is to lower your chances of getting high blood pressure, having too much water in 
your body (fluid retention), or having reduced levels of a chemical known as potassium in your blood.</p>         </div>"""

-
if you are a woman, especially if pregnant. Abiraterone Krka is for use in male patients only.

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Abiraterone Krka:
-
if you have liver problems.
-
if you have been told you have high blood pressure or heart failure or low blood potassium (low 
blood potassium may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems).
-
if you have had other heart or blood vessel problems,
-
if you have an irregular or rapid heart rate.
-
if you have shortness of breath.
-
if you have gained weight rapidly.
-
if you have swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs.
-
if you have taken a medicine known as ketoconazole in the past for prostate cancer.
-
about the need to take this medicine with prednisone or prednisolone.
-
about possible effects on your bones.
-
if you have high blood sugar.
Tell your doctor if you have been told you have any heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart 
rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being treated with medicines for these conditions.
Tell your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or severe nausea or 
vomiting, as these could be signs or symptoms of liver problems. Rarely, failure of the liver to 
function (called acute liver failure) may occur, which can lead to death.
Decrease in red blood cells, reduced sex drive (libido), muscle weakness and/or muscle pain may 
occur.
Abiraterone Krka must not be given in combination with Ra-223 due to a possible increase in the risk 
of bone fracture or death.
If you plan to take Ra-223 following treatment with Abiraterone Krka and prednisone/prednisolone, 
you must wait 5 days before starting treatment with Ra-223. If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this 
medicine.
Blood monitoring

Other medicines and Abiraterone Krka

(e.g., St John s wort) and others. Your doctor may want to change the dose of these medicines. Also, 
some medicines may increase or decrease the effects of Abiraterone Krka. This may lead to side 
effects or to Abiraterone Krka not working as well as it should.

you are receiving medicine
-
used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol);
-
known to increase the risk of heart rhythm problems [e.g. methadone (used for pain relief and 
part of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), antipsychotics (used for 
serious mental illnesses)].
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.
