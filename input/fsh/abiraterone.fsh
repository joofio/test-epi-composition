adult men that has spread to other parts of the body. Abiraterone Accord stops your body from making 
testosterone; this can slow the growth of prostate cancer. </p>
<p>When Abiraterone Accord  is prescribed for the early stage of disease where it is still responding to 
hormone therapy, it is used with a treatment that lowers testosterone (androgen deprivation therapy).  </p>
<p>When you take this medicine your doctor will also prescribe another medicine called prednisone or 
prednisolone. This is to lower your chances of getting high blood pressure, having too much water in 
your body (fluid retention), or having reduced levels of a chemical known as potassium in your blood. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions

rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being treated with medicines for these conditions. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or severe nausea or

function (called acute liver failure) may occur, which can lead to death. </p>
<p>Decrease in red blood cells, reduced sex drive (libido), muscle weakness and/or muscle pain may 
occur. </p>
<p>Abiraterone Accord must not be given in combination with Ra-223 due to a possible increase in the 
risk of bone fracture or death.  </p>
<p>If you plan to take Ra-223 following treatment with Abiraterone Accord and prednisone/prednisolone, 
you must wait 5 days before starting treatment with Ra-223.<br />

part of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), antipsychotics (used for 
serious mental illnesses)]. </p>
