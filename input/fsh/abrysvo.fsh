  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Abrysvo is a vaccine to prevent lung (respiratory tract) disease caused by a virus called respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV). Abrysvo is given to: </p>
<ul>
<li>pregnant individuals to protect their infants from birth through 6 months of age 
or </li>
<li>individuals 60 years of age and older. </li>
</ul>
<p>RSV is a common virus which, in most cases, causes mild, cold-like symptoms such as a sore throat, 
cough or a blocked nose. However, in young infants RSV can cause serious lung problems. In older 
adults and people with chronic medical conditions, RSV can worsen illnesses such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). RSV can lead to 
hospitalisation in severe cases and in some cases it can be fatal. </p>
<p>How Abrysvo works 
This vaccine helps the immune system (the body s natural defences) to make antibodies (substances in 
the blood that help the body fight infections) which protect against lung disease caused by RSV. In 
pregnant individuals who are vaccinated between weeks 24 and 36 of pregnancy, these antibodies are 
passed to the infant through the placenta before birth which protects infants when they are at most risk 
from RSV.  </p>         </div>"""

in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this vaccine 
* if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after you received any 
other vaccine injection or after you were given Abrysvo in the past. 
* if you are feeling nervous about getting the vaccine or have ever fainted after any injection. 
Fainting can happen before or after any injection 
* if you have an infection with a high fever. If this is the case, then vaccination will be 
postponed. There is no need to delay vaccination for a minor infection, such as a cold, but talk 
to your doctor first. 
* if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
* if you have a weakened immune system which may prevent you from getting the full benefit 
from Abrysvo. 
* if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Abrysvo. </p>
<p>As with any vaccine, Abrysvo may not fully protect all those who receive it. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Abrysvo is not recommended in children and young people below 18 years of age except during 
pregnancy (see  Pregnancy  section below). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Abrysvo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine.  </p>
<p>Abrysvo may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine. A gap of at least two weeks is recommended 
between administration of Abrysvo and administration of a vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria and 
acellular pertussis (whooping cough).  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnant individuals can be given this vaccine in the late second or third trimester (weeks 24 to 36). 
Talk to your doctor or nurse for advice before getting this vaccine if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Abrysvo is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Abrysvo contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
