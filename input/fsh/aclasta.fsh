  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Aclasta contains the active substance zoledronic acid. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
bisphosphonates and is used to treat post-menopausal women and adult men with osteoporosis or 
osteoporosis caused by treatment with corticosteroids used to treat inflammation, and Paget s disease 
of the bone in adults. </p>
<p>Osteoporosis 
Osteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in 
women after the menopause, but can also occur in men. At the menopause, a woman s ovaries stop 
producing the female hormone oestrogen, which helps keep bones healthy. Following the menopause 
bone loss occurs, bones become weaker and break more easily. Osteoporosis could also occur in men 
and women because of the long term use of steroids, which can affect the strength of bones. Many 
patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because 
osteoporosis has made their bones weaker. Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones, mainly 
oestrogens converted from androgens, also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men. 
In both women and men, Aclasta strengthens the bone and therefore makes it less likely to break. 
Aclasta is also used in patients who have recently broken their hip in a minor trauma such as a fall and 
therefore are at risk of subsequent bone breaks. </p>
<p>Paget s disease of the bone 
It is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material. This process is called 
remodelling. In Paget s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered 
fashion, which makes it weaker than normal. If the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed 
and painful, and may break. Aclasta works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal, 
securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone. </p>         </div>"""

Aclasta. </p>
<p>You must not be given Aclasta:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
<li>if you have hypocalcaemia (this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low). </li>
<li>if you have severe kidney problems. </li>
<li>if you are pregnant. </li>
<li>if you are breast-feeding. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Aclasta:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are being treated with any medicine containing zoledronic acid, which is also the active 
substance of Aclasta (zoledronic acid is used in adult patients with certain types of cancer to 
prevent bone complications or to reduce the amount of calcium). </li>
<li>if you have a kidney problem, or used to have one. </li>
<li>if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements. </li>
<li>if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed. </li>
<li>if you have had sections of your intestine removed. </li>
</ul>
<p>A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported in the 
post-marketing setting in patients receiving Aclasta (zoledronic acid) for osteoporosis. ONJ can also 
occur after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>It is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to 
treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions 
you should take. </p>
<p>Before receiving Aclasta treatment, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if 
- you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction; 
- you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; 
- you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); 
- you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders); 
- you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) 
- you have cancer. </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with Aclasta. </p>
<p>While being treated with Aclasta, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth 
brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit 
properly. If you are under dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth 
extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being 
treated with Aclasta. Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems 
with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as 
these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Monitoring test 
Your doctor should do a blood test to check your kidney function (levels of creatinine) before each 
dose of Aclasta. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of fluid (such as water), within a few 
hours before receiving Aclasta, as directed by your healthcare provider. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Aclasta is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Aclasta 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>It is important for your doctor to know all the medicines you are taking, especially if you are taking 
any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys (e.g. aminoglycosides) or diuretics ( waterpills ) 
that may cause dehydration. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must not be given Aclasta if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to have a baby. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you feel dizzy while taking Aclasta, do not drive or use machines until you feel better. </p>
<p>Aclasta contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 ml vial of Aclasta, i.e., 
essentially  sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Osteoporosis 
The usual dose is 5 mg given as one infusion per year into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The infusion 
will take at least 15 minutes. </p>
<p>In case you recently broke your hip, it is recommended that Aclasta is administered two or more 
weeks after your hip repair surgery. </p>
<p>It is important to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (for example tablets) as directed by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>For osteoporosis, Aclasta works for one year. Your doctor will let you know when to return for your 
next dose. </p>
<p>Paget s disease 
For the treatment of Paget s disease, Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience 
in the treatment of Paget s disease of the bone. </p>
<p>The usual dose is 5 mg, given to you as one initial infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The 
infusion will take at least 15 minutes. Aclasta may work for longer than one year, and your doctor will 
let you know if you need to be treated again. </p>
<p>Your doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (e.g. tablets) for at least the 
first ten days after being given Aclasta. It is important that you follow this advice carefully so that the 
level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the infusion. Your doctor 
will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia. </p>
<p>Aclasta with food and drink 
Make sure you drink enough fluids (at least one or two glasses) before and after the treatment with 
Aclasta, as directed by your doctor. This will help to prevent dehydration. You may eat normally on 
the day you are treated with Aclasta. This is especially important in patients who take diuretics ( water 
pills ) and in elderly patients (age 65 years or over). </p>
<p>If you missed a dose of Aclasta 
Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. </p>
<p>Before stopping Aclasta therapy 
If you are considering stopping Aclasta treatment, please go to your next appointment and discuss this 
with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with 
Aclasta. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Side effects related to the first infusion are very common (occurring in more than 30% of patients) but 
are less common following subsequent infusions. The majority of the side effects, such as fever and 
chills, pain in the muscles or joints, and headache, occur within the first three days following the dose 
of Aclasta. The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within three days. Your doctor 
can recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce these side effects. The 
chance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent doses of Aclasta. </p>
<p>Some side effects could be serious 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving Aclasta for the treatment 
of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart 
rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have 
received Aclasta. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Swelling, redness, pain and itching to the eyes or eye sensitivity to light. </p>
<p>Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) 
Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These could 
be signs of bone damage in the ear. </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
Pain in the mouth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores in the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness 
or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth; these could be signs of bone damage in the 
jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience such symptoms while 
being treated with Aclasta or after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Kidney disorders (e.g. decreased urine output) may occur. Your doctor should do a blood test to check 
your kidney function before each dose of Aclasta. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of 
fluid (such as water), within a few hours before receiving Aclasta, as directed by your healthcare 
provider. </p>
<p>If you experience any of the above side effects, you should contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Aclasta may also cause other side effects

ankles or feet, thirst, toothache, taste disturbances. </p>
<p>Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for osteoporosis may 
occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, hip or 
groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone. Low levels of 
phosphate in the blood. </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
Severe allergic reactions including dizziness and difficulty breathing, swelling mainly of the face and 
throat, decreased blood pressure, dehydration secondary to acute phase reactions (post-dose symptoms
