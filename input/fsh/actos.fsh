diabetes mellitus in adults, when metformin is not suitable or has failed to work adequately. This is the 
diabetes that usually develops in adulthood. </p>
<p>Actos helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by helping your 
body make better use of the insulin it produces. Your doctor will check whether Actos is working 3 to 
6 months after you start taking it. </p>
<p>Actos may be used on its own in patients who are unable to take metformin, and where treatment with 
diet and exercise has failed to control blood sugar or may be added to other therapies (such as 
metformin, sulphonylurea or insulin) which have failed to provide sufficient control of blood sugar. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past.<br />
- if you have liver disease.<br />
- if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight loss, 
nausea or vomiting). 
- if you have or have ever had bladder cancer. 
- if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Actos (also see section 4) 
- if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems, in particular if you are over 
75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and 
swelling, you must also tell your doctor. 
- if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back 
of the eye). 
- if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased 
possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Actos. If this 
applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned 
pregnancy. 
- if you have a problem with your liver or heart. Before you start taking Actos you will have a 
blood sample taken to check your liver function. This check may be repeated at intervals. Some 
patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with Actos and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of 
breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  </p>
<p>If you take Actos with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood sugar could fall 
below the normal level (hypoglycaemia).  </p>
<p>You may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). </p>
<p>Broken bones 
A higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your 
doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Actos 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>You can usually continue to take other medicines whilst you are being treated with Actos. However, 
certain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood:</p>
<ul>
<li>gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) </li>
<li>rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and 
your dose of Actos may need to be changed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Actos with food and drink 
You may take your tablets with or without food. You should swallow the tablets with a glass of water.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if<br />
- you are, you think you might be or are planning to become pregnant.<br />
- you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your baby.<br />
Your doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine will not affect your ability to drive or use machines but take care if you experience 
abnormal vision. </p>
<p>Actos contains lactose monohydrate<br />
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking Actos. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The usual starting dose is one tablet of 15 mg or of 30 mg of pioglitazone to be taken once daily. Your 
doctor may increase the dose to a maximum of 45 mg once a day. Your doctor will tell you the dose to 
take. </p>
<p>If you have the impression that the effect of Actos is too weak, talk to your doctor.  </p>
<p>When Actos is taken in combination with other medicines used to treat diabetes (such as insulin, 
chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide) your doctor will tell you whether you need to 
take a smaller dose of your medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to have blood tests periodically during treatment with Actos. This is to check 
that your liver is working normally. </p>
<p>If you are following a special diet for diabetes, you should continue with this while you are taking 
Actos. </p>
<p>Your weight should be checked at regular intervals; if your weight increases, inform your doctor. </p>
<p>If you take more Actos than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, talk to a 
doctor or pharmacist immediately. Your blood sugar could fall below the normal level and can be 
increased by taking sugar. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or 
sugary fruit juice. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Actos 
Take Actos daily as prescribed. However if you miss a dose, just carry on with the next dose as 
normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Actos 
Actos should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using Actos, your blood sugar may go 
up. Talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. </p>
