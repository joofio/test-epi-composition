If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. 
► 
If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. ► 
If the resuspended insulin does not appear uniformly white and cloudy. </p>
<p>If any of these apply, do not use Actraphane. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. </p>
<p>Before using Actraphane </p>
<p>► 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. 
► 
Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not 
use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band 
at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that 
the cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. 
► 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
► 
Needles and Actraphane Penfill must not be shared. 
► 
Actraphane Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
► 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
► 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. 
► 
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. 
► 
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site </p>
<p>The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3). Tell your doctor if you notice any skin 
changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these affected areas 
before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more 
closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Actraphane </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
* Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
* Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
* Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
* Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever) 
* Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
* Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
* Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
* Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
* Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation) 
* Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
* Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
* Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
* Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). </p>
<p>Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. </p>
<p>Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). </p>
<p>If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>Actraphane with alcohol </p>
<p>► 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>► 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Actraphane can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your 
diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
► 
There are no restrictions on treatment with Actraphane during breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>► 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
* If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
* If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. </p>
<p>Actraphane contains sodium </p>
<p>Actraphane contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actraphane is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Dose and when to take your insulin </p>
<p>Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood 
sugar. </p>
<p>Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents </p>
<p>Actraphane can be used in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Use in special patient groups </p>
<p>If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. </p>
<p>How and where to inject </p>
<p>Actraphane is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject 
yourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Actraphane Penfill is only 
suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject 
your insulin by another method. </p>
<p>With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an 
injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. 
The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always 
measure your blood sugar regularly. </p>
<p>► 
Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. 
► 
Actraphane Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery 
systems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. 
► 
If you are treated with Actraphane Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use 
two insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. 
► 
Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. </p>
<p>Resuspension of Actraphane </p>
<p>Always check if there is enough insulin left (at least 12 units) in the cartridge to allow even 
resuspension. If there is not enough insulin left, use a new one. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. </p>
<p>► 
Every time you use a new Actraphane Penfill (before you put the cartridge into the insulin 
delivery system). 
* Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to resuspend. 
* Move the cartridge up and down between positions a and b and back (see the picture) so that the 
glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times.<br />
<em> Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection.<br />
</em> The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy. 
* Complete the other stages of injection without delay. </p>
<p>How to inject Actraphane </p>
<p>► 
Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse 
and as described in your pen manual. 
► 
Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed 
until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit 
possible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. 
► 
After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actraphane without the 
needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing.  </p>
<p>If you take more insulin than you should </p>
<p>If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious 
and very common side effects in section 4.<br />
If you forget to take your insulin </p>
<p>If you forget to take your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4.<br />
If you stop taking your insulin </p>
<p>Do not stop taking your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See Effects 
from diabetes in section 4.<br />
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Summary of serious and very common side effects </p>
<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in people. </p>
<p>Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
* Inject too much insulin. 
* Eat too little or miss a meal. 
* Exercise more than usual. 
* Drink alcohol, see Actraphane with alcohol in section 2.<br />
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. </p>
<p>Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. </p>
<p>What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
► 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case. 
► 
When the symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when your blood sugar level is 
stabilised, continue insulin treatment as usual. 
► 
If you have such low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had the need for an 
injection of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk to a 
doctor. The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (becoming unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink, because you may choke. </p>
<p>Serious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) 
is a very rare side effect, but it can potentially be life threatening. It may affect less than 1 in 10,people. </p>
<p>Seek medical advice immediately: 
* If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
* If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
► 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect less than 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  </p>
<p>List of other side effects </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects 
May affect less than 1 in 100 people. </p>
<p>Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. </p>
<p>Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. </p>
<p>Swollen joints: When you start taking insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you 
may get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. </p>
<p>Very rare side effects<br />
May affect less than 1 in 10,000 people. </p>
<p>Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Effects from diabetes  </p>
<p>High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) </p>
<p>High blood sugar may occur if you: 
* Have not injected enough insulin. 
* Forget to inject your insulin or stop taking insulin. 
* Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need. 
* Get an infection and/or a fever. 
* Eat more than usual. 
* Exercise less than usual. </p>
<p>Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. </p>
<p>What to do if you experience high blood sugar: 
► 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately. 
► 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build–up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. </p>         </div>"""
