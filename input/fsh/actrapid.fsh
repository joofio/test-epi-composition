Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your 
blood sugar. Treatment with Actrapid helps to prevent complications from your diabetes.  </p>
<p>Actrapid will start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you inject it, and the effect will 
last for approximately 8 hours. Actrapid is often given in combination with intermediate-acting or 
long-acting insulin preparations. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. </p>
<p>If it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5.  <br />
If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. </p>
<p>If any of these apply, do not use Actrapid. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. </p>
<p>Before using Actrapid </p>
<p>Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin. </p>
<p>Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not 
use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band 
at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be the result of an insulin leakage. If you suspect that 
the cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further 
instructions. </p>
<p>Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. </p>
<p>Needles and Actrapid Penfill must not be shared. </p>
<p>Actrapid Penfill is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your 
doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: </p>
<p>If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. </p>
<p>If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level. </p>
<p>If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
hereof. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site </p>
<p>The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3). Tell your doctor if you notice any skin 
changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these affected areas 
before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more 
closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Actrapid </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
* Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
* Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
* Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
* Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)<br />
* Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) 
* Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
* Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
* Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
* Glucocorticoids (such as  cortisone  used to treat inflammation) 
* Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
* Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
* Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body s metabolic processes) 
* Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). </p>
<p>Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. </p>
<p>Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). </p>
<p>If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>Actrapid with alcohol </p>
<p>If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Actrapid can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin 
dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your 
diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. </p>
<p>There are no restrictions on treatment with Actrapid during breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine while pregnant or breast-
feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine: 
* If you have frequent hypoglycaemia. 
* If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore 
also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. </p>
<p>Actrapid contains sodium </p>
<p>Actrapid contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. Actrapid is essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection to avoid low blood 
sugar. </p>
<p>Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents </p>
<p>Actrapid can be used in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Use in special patient groups </p>
<p>If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. </p>
<p>How and where to inject </p>
<p>Actrapid is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself 
directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Actrapid Penfill is only suitable for 
injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. </p>
<p>With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting, see section 4. The best places to give yourself an 
injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms. 
The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the waist (abdomen). You should always 
measure your blood sugar regularly. </p>
<p>Do not refill the cartridge. Once empty, it must be disposed of. </p>
<p>Actrapid Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems 
and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles. </p>
<p>If you are treated with Actrapid Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge, you should use two 
insulin delivery systems, one for each type of insulin. </p>
<p>Always carry a spare Penfill cartridge in case the one in use is lost or damaged. </p>
<p>How to inject Actrapid </p>
<p>Inject the insulin under your skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse 
and as described in your pen manual. </p>
<p>Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds. Keep the push-button fully depressed 
until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin. This will ensure correct delivery and limit 
possible flow of blood into the needle or insulin reservoir. </p>
<p>After each injection, be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actrapid without the 
needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out, which can cause inaccurate dosing. </p>
<p>If you take more insulin than you should </p>
<p>If you take too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See Summary of serious 
and very common side effects in section </p>         </div>"""
