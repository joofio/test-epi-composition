antipsychotics. ADASUVE works by blocking certain chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) such 
as dopamine and serotonin thus causing calming effects and relieving aggressive behaviour. </p>
<p>ADASUVE is used to treat acute symptoms of mild-to-moderate agitation that may occur in adult 
patients who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These are diseases characterised by symptoms 
such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>(Schizophrenia) Hearing, seeing, or sensing things which are not there, suspiciousness, mistaken 
beliefs, incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional flatness. People with this condition may 
also feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense. </li>
<li>(Bipolar disorder) Feeling “high”, having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep 
than usual, talking very quickly with racing ideas, and sometimes severe irritability. </li>

* if you are allergic to loxapine or amoxapine; 
* if you have symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath; 
* if you have lung problems like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which your 
doctor may have called “COPD”). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor or nurse will talk to you before you use ADASUVE and determine whether it is 
appropriate for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>ADASUVE may cause narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) and may cause you to wheeze, 
cough, feel chest tightness or have shortness of breath. Typically, this may occur within minutes of use. </li>
<li>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a set of symptoms that can occur if you are taking 
antipsychotic medicines, including ADASUVE. These symptoms can be high fever, rigid muscles, </li>
</ul>
<p>irregular or fast heart rate or pulse. NMS can cause death. Do not use ADASUVE again if NMS 
occurs. 
* Antipsychotic medicines like ADASUVE can cause movements that you may not be able to 
control including making faces, sticking out your tongue, smacking or puckering your lips, 
blinking rapidly, or moving your legs, arms or fingers rapidly. Treatment with ADASUVE may 
have to be stopped if this occurs. 
* ADASUVE should be used with caution in patients who are intoxicated or delirious. </p>
<p>Before treatment with ADASUVE, tell your doctor or nurse if you: 
* have or had breathing problems like asthma or other chronic lung diseases such as bronchitis or 
emphysema 
* have or had heart problems or stroke 
* have or had low or high blood pressure 
* have or had seizures (convulsions) 
* have or had glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) 
* have or had urinary retention (incomplete emptying of the bladder) 
* already used ADASUVE and you developed symptoms of wheezing or shortness of breath 
* ever had muscle or eye movements you can’t control, lack of coordination, sustained muscle 
contraction, or feeling restless or unable to sit still 
* are an older person with dementia (loss of memory and other mental abilities). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ADASUVE is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ADASUVE 
Tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines, including: 
* adrenaline 
* medicines to treat a breathing problem 
* medicines that may put you at a risk for seizures (for example, clozapine, tricyclics or SSRIs, 
tramadol, mefloquine) 
* medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease 
* lorazepam or other centrally acting medicines (to treat anxiety, depression, pain, or to help you 
sleep) or any other medicines that cause sleepiness 
* recreational (illegal) drugs 
* medicines like fluvoxamine, propranolol, and enoxacin and other medicines that inhibit a certain 
liver enzyme called “CYP450 1A2.” 
* medicines to treat schizophrenia, depression, or pain since you may be more at risk for seizures 
Using ADASUVE and adrenaline together may cause your blood pressure to drop. </p>
<p>ADASUVE with alcohol 
Because ADASUVE affects the nervous system, alcohol should be avoided when using ADASUVE. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. You should not breast-feed for a period of 48 hours 
after receiving ADASUVE and should discard the milk produced in the meantime. </p>
<p>The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies of mothers that have repeatedly used 
antipsychotic medicines in the last three months of their pregnancy: shaking, muscle stiffness and/or 
weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops 
any of these symptoms you may need to contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines after using ADASUVE until you know how ADASUVE 
affects you since dizziness, sedation, and sleepiness have been reported as a potential side effect of 
ADASUVE. </p>         </div>"""

carefully considering your condition and your dose may be reduced to 4.5 mg if your doctor believes

<p>If you get any of the following side effects, talk to your doctor immediately and stop taking the 
medicine:<br />
* any breathing symptoms such as wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, or chest tightness, as these 
could mean that the medicine is irritating your airways (uncommon occurrence unless you have 
asthma or COPD); 
* light-headedness or fainting, as these could mean that the medicine is lowering your blood 
pressure (uncommon occurrence); 
* worsening agitation or confusion, especially combined with fever or muscle stiffness (rare 
occurrence). These can be associated with a severe condition called neuroleptic malignant 
syndrome (NMS)  </p>

other forms of this medicine: </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): bad taste in the mouth or sleepiness. </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): dizziness, throat irritation, dry mouth or tiredness. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): muscle or eye movements you can’t control, lack of

be relevant for ADASUVE include faintness upon standing, increased heart rate, increased blood 
pressure, blurred vision, dry eyes, and decreased urination.  </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects
