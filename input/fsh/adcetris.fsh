  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Adcetris contains the active substance brentuximab vedotin, an anti-cancer agent, which is made up 
of a monoclonal antibody linked to a substance intended to kill cancer cells. This substance is 
delivered to cancer cells by the monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a protein which 
recognises certain cancer cells.  </p>
<p>Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are 
types of cancer of the white blood cells. </p>
<p>Classical Hodgkin lymphoma expresses specific proteins on the cell surface that are different from 
non-classical Hodgkin lymphoma.  </p>
<p>Adcetris is used to treat patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not had 
treatment before. Adcetris will be given to you together with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine 
which are other chemotherapy medicines used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.  </p>
<p>Adcetris is used alone to lower the likelihood of classical Hodgkin lymphoma coming back after an 
autologous stem cell transplant in patients with certain risk factors. </p>
<p>Adcetris is also used alone to treat classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has: 
- come back after or not responded to an infusion of your own healthy stem cells into your body 
(autologous stem cell transplant), or 
- come back after or never responded to at least two previous therapies, and where you cannot 
receive additional combination anti-cancer treatments or have an autologous stem cell 
transplant. </p>
<p>Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma found in your lymph 
nodes and/or throughout other parts of your body. </p>
<p>Adcetris is used to treat patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma who have not had 
treatment before. Adcetris will be given to you together with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 
prednisone which are other chemotherapy medicines used to treat these conditions. </p>
<p>Adcetris is also used to treat systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma that has: 
- not responded to other types of anti-cancer treatments, or<br />
- come back after previous anti-cancer treatment. </p>
<p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a cancer of a certain type of white blood cell called a ‘T-cell’ that 
mainly affects the skin. Adcetris is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma where a specific type of 
protein is present on the cells’ surface. </p>
<p>Adcetris is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who have previously received at least 
one anti-cancer medicine that travels through the bloodstream. </p>         </div>"""

</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>When you first receive this medicine and during the course of treatment, tell your doctor if you: 
- have confusion, trouble thinking, memory loss, blurred or loss of vision, decreased strength, 
decreased control or sensation in one arm or leg, a change in the way of walking, or loss of 
balance, as these may be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal brain condition known as 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you have these symptoms prior to 
treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor immediately about any changes in these 
symptoms. You should also inform your partner or caregivers about your treatment, since they 
may notice symptoms that you are not aware of 
- have severe and persistent stomach pain, with or without nausea and vomiting, as these may be 
symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal condition known as pancreatitis (inflammation of 
the pancreas) 
- have new or worsening shortness of breath or cough as these may be symptoms of a serious and 
potentially fatal lung complication (pulmonary toxicity) 
- are taking, or have previously taken, medicines which may affect your immune system, such as 
chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents<br />
- have, or think you have, an infection. Some infections may be serious and can be due to viruses, 
bacteria, or other causes that may be life-threatening 
- experience a whistling sound during breathing (wheezing)/difficulty breathing, hives, itching, or 
swelling (signs of an infusion reaction). For more detailed information, see “Infusion reactions” 
in section 4 
- have any problems with a change in the sensitivity of the skin, especially in the hands or feet, 
such as numbness, tingling, a burning sensation, pain, discomfort or weakness (neuropathy) 
- have headaches, feel tired, experience dizziness, look pale (anaemia), or have unusual bleeding 
or bruising under the skin, longer than usual bleeding after your blood has been drawn, or 
bleeding from your gums (thrombocytopenia)<br />
- develop chills or shivering, or feel warm; you should take your temperature as you may have a 
fever. A fever with a low white blood cell count may be a sign of serious infection<br />
- experience dizziness, decreased urination, confusion, vomiting, nausea, swelling, shortness of 
breath, or heart rhythm disturbances (this may be a potentially life-threatening complication 
known as tumour lysis syndrome) 
- experience flu-like symptoms followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters 
including extensive detachment of the skin that may be life-threatening (this may be a serious 
skin reaction known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) 
- experience widespread rash, high body temperature and enlarged lymph nodes (DRESS 
syndrome or drug hypersensitivity syndrome) 
- have new or worsening stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation as these may be symptoms 
of a serious and potentially fatal stomach or intestinal complication (gastrointestinal 
complications) 
- have abnormal liver test results as this may be related to a serious and potentially fatal liver 
injury (hepatotoxicity). Liver disease and other medical conditions that may have been present 
before you start taking Adcetris and some medications that you are currently taking might 
increase the risk of liver injury 
- feel tired, have frequent urination, increased thirst, increased appetite with unintended weight 
loss, or irritability (hyperglycaemia) 
- get a burning sensation, feel pain or tenderness at or surrounding the infusion site during the 
infusion, this could indicate that Adcetris has leaked outside the blood vessel. Tell your doctor 
or nurse immediately. If Adcetris has leaked outside the blood vessel, skin redness, pain, 
discolouration, swelling, blistering, peeling, or infection of deeper layers of your skin (cellulitis) 
at or surrounding the infusion site can occur within days or weeks after the infusion. 
- have kidney or liver problems </p>
<p>Your doctor will perform regular blood tests to make sure that it is safe for you to receive this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Adcetris </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, if you have taken any recently, or if you start 
taking new ones. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you can obtain without a 
prescription.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>You and your partner must use two methods of effective contraception during your treatment with this 
medicine. Women must continue using contraception for 6 months following the last dose of Adcetris. </p>
<p>You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant unless you and your doctor decide that the 
benefit to you outweighs the potential risk to the unborn baby.  </p>
<p>It is important to tell your doctor before and during treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, you should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Men being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before 
treatment. Men are advised not to father a child during treatment with this medicine and for up to 
6 months following the last dose of this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Your treatment may influence your ability to drive or operate machines. If you feel unwell during 
treatment then do not drive or operate machines. </p>
<p>Adcetris contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 13.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

chemotherapy, your doctor may also give you a medicine that will help prevent development or reduce

infection. Tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems as your doctor may lower your starting 
dose or may not recommend Adcetris. </p>
