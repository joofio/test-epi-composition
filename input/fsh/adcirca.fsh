ADCIRCA is a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults and in children aged 2 years

<p>It belongs to a group of medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors which work by 
helping the blood vessels around your lungs relax, improving the flow of blood into your lungs. The

- if you are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients (see section 6). 
- if you are taking any form of nitrates such as amyl nitrite, used in the treatment of chest pain. 
ADCIRCA has been shown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any 
form of nitrate or are unsure tell your doctor. 
- if you have ever had loss of vision   a condition described as  stroke of the eye  (non-arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy - NAION). 
- if you have had a heart attack in the last 3 months.<br />
- if you have low blood pressure.<br />
- if you are taking riociguat. This medicine is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., 
high blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., 
high blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as ADCIRCA, 
have been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine.  If you are taking 
riociguat or are unsure tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking ADCIRCA. 
Before taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>any heart problems other than your pulmonary hypertension </li>
<li>
<p>problems with your blood pressure </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any hereditary eye disease </p>
</li>
<li>an abnormality of red blood cells (sickle cell anaemia) </li>
<li>cancer of the bone marrow (multiple myeloma) </li>
<li>cancer of the blood cells (leukaemia) </li>
<li>any deformation of your penis, or unwanted or persistent erections lasting more than 4 hours </li>
<li>a serious liver problem </li>
<li>a serious kidney problem. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision or your vision is distorted, dimmed while you are 
taking ADCIRCA, stop taking ADCIRCA and contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Decreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not 
known if the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, 
contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ADCIRCA is not recommended for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in children under 
2 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.   </p>
<p>Other medicines and ADCIRCA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Do NOT take these tablets if you are already taking nitrates. </p>
<p>Some medicines may be affected by ADCIRCA or they may affect how well ADCIRCA will work. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>bosentan (another treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension) </li>
<li>nitrates (for chest pain) </li>
<li>alpha blockers used to treat high blood pressure or prostate problems </li>
<li>riociguat </li>
<li>rifampicin (to treat bacterial infections) </li>
<li>ketoconazole tablets (to treat fungal infections) </li>
<li>ritonavir (for HIV treatment) </li>
<li>tablets for erectile dysfunction (PDE5 inhibitors). </li>
</ul>
<p>ADCIRCA with alcohol 
Drinking alcohol may temporarily lower your blood pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take 
ADCIRCA, avoid excessive drinking (over 5 units of alcohol), since this may increase the risk of 
dizziness when standing up.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Do not take ADCIRCA when pregnant, unless it is 
strictly necessary and you have discussed this with your doctor. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while taking these tablets as it is not known if the medicine passes into human 
breast milk. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding. </p>
<p>When dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes.  A reduction in sperm 
was seen in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness has been reported. Check carefully how you react to this medicine before driving or using 
any machinery. </p>
<p>ADCIRCA contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>ADCIRCA contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>chest pain - do not use nitrates, but seek immediate medical assistance (frequency common). </p>

<li>sudden loss of vision (rarely reported), distorted, dimmed, blurred central vision or sudden

been rarely reported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partial, temporary or permanent decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes and serious 
allergic reaction which causes swelling of the face or throat. Sudden decrease or loss of hearing 
has also been reported. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some side effects have been reported in men taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.<br />
These events were not seen in clinical trials for pulmonary arterial hypertension and therefore 
frequency is unknown:</p>
<ul>
<li>swelling of the eyelids, eye pain, red eyes, heart attack and stroke. </li>

<ul>
<li>distorted, dimmed, blurred central vision or sudden decrease of vision (frequency not known). </li>
</ul>
<p>Most but not all of those men reporting fast heart rate, irregular heartbeat, heart attack, stroke and 
sudden cardiac death had known heart problems before taking tadalafil. It is not possible to determine 
whether these events were related directly to tadalafil. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
