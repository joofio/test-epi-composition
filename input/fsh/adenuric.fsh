  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>ADENURIC tablets contain the active substance febuxostat and are used to treat gout, which is 
associated with an excess of a chemical called uric acid (urate) in the body. In some people, the 
amount of uric acid builds up in the blood and may become too high to remain soluble. When this 
happens, urate crystals may form in and around the joints and kidneys. These crystals can cause 
sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint (known as a gout attack). Left untreated, 
larger deposits called tophi may form in and around joints. These tophi may cause joint and bone 
damage. </p>
<p>ADENURIC works by reducing uric acid levels. Keeping uric acid levels low by taking ADENURIC 
once every day stops crystals building up, and over time it reduces symptoms. Keeping uric acid levels 
sufficiently low for a long enough period can also shrink tophi. </p>
<p>ADENURIC 120 mg tablets is also used to treat and prevent high blood levels of uric acid that may 
occur when you start to receive chemotherapy for blood cancers. 
When chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, and uric acid levels increase in the blood 
accordingly, unless the formation of uric acid is prevented. </p>
<p>ADENURIC is for adults. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking ADENURIC: 
* If you have or have had heart failure,  heart problems or stroke 
* If you have or have had renal disease and/or serious allergic reaction to Allopurinol (a 
medication used for the treatment of Gout) 
* If you have or have had liver disease or liver function test abnormalities 
* If you are being treated for high uric acid levels as a result of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare 
inherited condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood) 
* If you have thyroid problems. </p>
<p>Should you experience allergic reactions to ADENURIC, stop taking this medicine (see also section 
4). Possible symptoms of allergic reactions might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>rash including severe forms (e.g. blisters, nodules, itchy-, exfoliative rash), itchiness </li>
<li>swelling of limbs or face </li>
<li>difficulties in breathing </li>
<li>fever with enlarged lymph nodes </li>
<li>but also serious life threatening allergic conditions with cardiac and circulatory arrest.<br />
Your doctor might decide to permanently stop treatment with ADENURIC. </li>
</ul>
<p>There have been rare reports of potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
with the use of ADENURIC, appearing initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often 
with central blister on the trunk. It may also include ulcers in the mouth, throat, nose, genitals and 
conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). The rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the 
skin. 
If you have developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with the use of febuxostat, you must not be re-
started on ADENURIC at any time. If you develop a rash or these skin symptoms, seek immediate 
advice from a doctor and tell that you are taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are having a gout attack at the moment (a sudden onset of severe pain, tenderness, redness, 
warmth and swelling in a joint), wait for the gout attack to subside before first starting treatment with 
ADENURIC. </p>
<p>For some people, gout attacks may flare up when starting certain medicines that control uric acid 
levels. Not everyone gets flares, but you could get a flare-up even if you are taking ADENURIC, and 
especially during the first weeks or months of treatment. It is important to keep taking ADENURIC 
even if you have a flare, as ADENURIC is still working to lower uric acid. Over time, gout flares will 
occur less often and be less painful if you keep taking ADENURIC every day. </p>
<p>Your doctor will often prescribe other medicines, if they are needed, to help prevent or treat the 
symptoms of flares (such as pain and swelling in a joint). </p>
<p>In patients with very high urate levels (e.g. those undergoing cancer chemotherapy), treatment with 
uric acid-lowering medicines could lead to the build-up of xanthine in the urinary tract, with possible 
stones, even though this has not been observed in patients being treated with ADENURIC for Tumor 
Lysis Syndrome. </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to have blood tests to check that your liver is working normally. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 18 because the safety and efficacy have not 
been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ADENURIC </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
It is especially important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines containing any 
of the following substances as they may interact with ADENURIC and your doctor may wish to 
consider necessary measures: 
* Mercaptopurine (used to treat cancer) 
* Azathioprine (used to reduce immune response) 
* Theophylline (used to treat asthma) </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>It is not known if ADENURIC may harm your unborn child. ADENURIC should not be used during 
pregnancy. It is not known if ADENURIC may pass into human breast milk. You should not use 
ADENURIC if you are breast feeding, or if you are planning to breastfeed. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Be aware that you may experience dizziness, sleepiness, blurred vision and numbness or tingling 
sensation during treatment and should not drive or operate machines if affected. </p>
<p>ADENURIC contains lactose </p>
<p>ADENURIC tablets contain lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>ADENURIC contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

ADENURIC is available as either an 80 mg tablet or a 120 mg tablet. Your doctor will have prescribed

<p>Prevention and treatment of high uric acid levels in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy 
ADENURIC is available as a 120 mg tablet. 
Start taking ADENURIC two days before chemotherapy and continue its use according to your 
doctor s advice. Usually treatment is short-term. </p>
<p>The score line on the 80 mg tablet is only there to help you break the tablet if you have difficulty 
swallowing it whole. </p>
<p>If you take more ADENURIC than you should </p>
<p>In the event of an accidental overdose ask your doctor what to do, or contact your nearest accident and 
emergency department. </p>
<p>If you forget to take ADENURIC </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of ADENURIC take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your 
next dose, in which case miss out the forgotten dose and take your next dose at the normal time. Do 
not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking ADENURIC </p>
<p>Do not stop taking ADENURIC without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. If you stop 
taking ADENURIC your uric acid levels may begin to rise and your symptoms may worsen due to the 
formation of new crystals of urate in and around your joints and kidneys. </p>
