Adjupanrix is a vaccine for use in prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic 
situation. </p>
<p>Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many 
decades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of 
ordinary flu but may be more serious. </p>
<p>How Adjupanrix works 
When a person is given the vaccine, the body s natural defence system (immune system) produces its 
own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. </p>
<p>As with all vaccines, Adjupanrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Adjupanrix should not be given 
* If you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this 
vaccine (listed in section 6) or to anything else that may be present in very small amounts, such 
as: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or 
sodium deoxycholate.<br />
- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling 
of the face or tongue.<br />
- However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as 
medical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Do not have Adjupanrix if any of the above apply to you.   </p>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. </p>
<p>Warning and precautions: </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Adjupanrix  </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any 
ingredient of Adjupanrix (listed in section 6) or to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, 
ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate. </li>
<li>if you have a serious infection with a high temperature (over 38 C). If this applies to you then 
your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as 
a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be vaccinated 
with Adjupanrix. </li>
<li>if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be 
poor. </li>
<li>if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first 
few weeks after vaccination with Adjupanrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell 
the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received Adjupanrix. </li>
<li>you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if 
you fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having 
Adjupanrix. This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. </p>
<p>Children &lt;6 years of age 
If your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after 
the second dose, especially temperature over 38 C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures 
to lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each 
dose are recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Adjupanrix 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or 
have recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are having any treatments (such as corticosteroid 
treatments or chemotherapy for cancer) that affect the immune system. Adjupanrix can still be given 
but your response to the vaccine may be poor. </p>
<p>Adjupanrix is not intended to be given at the same time as some other vaccines. However, if this needs 
to happen, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm. Any side effects that happen may be 
more serious.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Some side effects listed in Section 4.  Possible side effects  may affect your ability to drive or use 
tools or machines. It is best to see how Adjupanrix affects you before you try these activities. </p>
<p>Adjupanrix contains thiomersal<br />
Adjupanrix contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic 
reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. </p>
<p>Adjupanrix contains sodium and potassium 
Adjupanrix contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per 
dose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free. </p>         </div>"""
