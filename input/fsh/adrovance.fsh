  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What is alendronate? 
Alendronate belongs to a group of non-hormonal medicines called bisphosphonates. Alendronate 
prevents the loss of bone that occurs in women after they have been through the menopause, and helps 
to rebuild bone. It reduces the risk of spine and hip fractures.  </p>
<p>What is vitamin D? 
Vitamin D is an essential nutrient, required for calcium absorption and healthy bones. The body can 
only absorb calcium properly from our food if it has enough vitamin D. Very few foods contain 
vitamin D. The main source is through exposure to summer sunlight, which makes vitamin D in our 
skin. As we get older our skin makes less vitamin D. Too little vitamin D may lead to bone loss and 
osteoporosis. Severe vitamin D deficiency may cause muscle weakness which can lead to falls and a 
greater risk of fractures. </p>
<p>What is ADROVANCE used for? 
Your doctor has prescribed ADROVANCE to treat your osteoporosis and because you are at risk of 
vitamin D insufficiency. It reduces the risk of spine and hip fractures in women after menopause. </p>
<p>What is osteoporosis? 
Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones. It is common in women after the menopause. 
At the menopause, the ovaries stop producing the female hormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep a 
woman s skeleton healthy. As a result, bone loss occurs and bones become weaker. The earlier a 
woman reaches the menopause, the greater the risk of osteoporosis.  </p>
<p>Early on, osteoporosis usually has no symptoms. If left untreated, however, it can result in broken 
bones. Although these usually hurt, breaks in the bones of the spine may go unnoticed until they cause 
height loss. Broken bones can happen during normal, everyday activity, such as lifting, or from minor 
injury that would not generally break normal bone. Broken bones usually occur at the hip, spine, or 
wrist and can lead not only to pain but also to considerable problems like stooped posture ( dowager s 
hump ) and loss of mobility. </p>
<p>How can osteoporosis be treated? 
As well as your treatment with ADROVANCE, your doctor may suggest you make changes to your 
lifestyle to help your condition, such as: </p>
<p>Stopping smoking 
Smoking appears to increase the rate at which you lose bone and, therefore, 
may increase your risk of broken bones. </p>
<p>Exercise 
Like muscles, bones need exercise to stay strong and healthy. Consult your 
doctor before you begin any exercise programme. </p>
<p>Eating a balanced diet Your doctor can advise you about your diet or whether you should take any 
dietary supplements. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to alendronic acid, colecalciferol or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6),<br />
* if you have certain problems with your gullet (oesophagus - the tube that connects your mouth 
with your stomach) such as narrowing or difficulty swallowing, 
* if you cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes, 
* if your doctor has told you that you have low blood calcium. </p>
<p>If you think any of these apply to you, do not take the tablets. Talk to your doctor first and follow the 
advice given. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ADROVANCE if: 
* you suffer from kidney problems, 
* you have, or have recently had, any swallowing or digestive problems, 
* your doctor has told you that you have Barrett's oesophagus (a condition associated with 
changes in the cells that line the lower oesophagus), 
* you have been told you have trouble absorbing minerals in your stomach or intestines 
(malabsorption syndrome), 
* you have poor dental health, gum disease, a planned dental extraction or you don t receive 
routine dental care, 
* you have cancer, 
* you are undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, 
* you are taking angiogenesis inhibitors (such as bevacizumab, or thalidomide) which are used in 
the treatment of cancer, 
* you are taking corticosteroids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) which are used in the 
treatment of such conditions as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and severe allergies, 
* you are or have been a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems). </p>
<p>You may be advised to have a dental check-up before starting treatment with ADROVANCE. </p>
<p>It is important to maintain good oral hygiene when being treated with ADROVANCE. You should 
have routine dental check-ups throughout your treatment and you should contact your doctor or dentist 
if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling. </p>
<p>Irritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet (oesophagus   the tube that connects your mouth 
with your stomach) often with symptoms of chest pain, heartburn, or difficulty or pain upon 
swallowing may occur, especially if patients do not drink a full glass of water and/or if they lie down 
less than 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE. These side effects may worsen if patients continue to 
take ADROVANCE after developing these symptoms. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ADROVANCE should not be given to children and adolescents less than 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ADROVANCE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>It is likely that calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicines will interfere with the 
absorption of ADROVANCE if taken at the same time. Therefore, it is important that you follow the 
advice given in section 3 and wait at least 30 minutes before taking any other oral medicines or 
supplements. </p>
<p>Certain medicines for rheumatism or long-term pain called NSAIDs (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or 
ibuprofen) might cause digestive problems. Therefore, caution should be used when these medicines 
are taken at the same time as ADROVANCE. </p>
<p>It is likely that certain medicines or food additives may prevent the vitamin D in ADROVANCE from 
getting into your body, including artificial fat substitutes, mineral oils, the weight loss medicine, 
orlistat, and the cholesterol-lowering medicines, cholestyramine and colestipol. Medicines for fits 
(seizures) (like phenytoin or phenobarbital) may decrease the effectiveness of vitamin D. Additional 
vitamin D supplements may be considered on an individual basis. </p>
<p>ADROVANCE with food and drink 
It is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water) will make ADROVANCE less effective 
if taken at the same time. Therefore, it is important that you follow the advice given in section 3. You 
must wait at least 30 minutes before taking any food and beverages except water. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women. You should not take 
ADROVANCE if you are or think you may be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There have been side effects (for example blurred vision, dizziness and severe bone, muscle or joint 
pain) reported with ADROVANCE that may affect your ability to drive or operate machinery (see 
section 4). If you experience any of these side effects you should not drive until you feel better. </p>
<p>ADROVANCE contains lactose and sucrose. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>ADROVANCE contains sodium.<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Follow these instructions carefully. </p>
<p>1) 
Choose the day of the week that best fits your schedule. Every week, take one ADROVANCE 
tablet on your chosen day. </p>
<p>It is very important to follow instructions 2), 3), 4) and 5) to help the ADROVANCE tablet reach your

connects your mouth with your stomach). </p>
<p>2) 
After getting up for the day and before taking any food, drink, or other medicine, swallow your 
ADROVANCE tablet whole with a full glass of water only (not mineral water) (not less than 
200 ml), so that ADROVANCE is adequately absorbed. 
* Do not take with mineral water (still or sparkling). 
* Do not take with coffee or tea. 
* Do not take with juice or milk. </p>
<p>Do not crush or chew the tablet or allow it to dissolve in your mouth because of the possibility of 
mouth ulceration. </p>
<p>3) 
Do not lie down   stay fully upright (sitting, standing or walking)   for at least 30 minutes 
after swallowing the tablet. Do not lie down until after your first food of the day. </p>
<p>4) 
Do not take ADROVANCE at bedtime or before getting up for the day. </p>
<p>5) 
If you develop difficulty or pain upon swallowing, chest pain, or new or worsening heartburn,

<p>6) 
After swallowing your ADROVANCE tablet, wait at least 30 minutes before taking your first 
food, drink, or other medicine of the day, including antacids, calcium supplements and vitamins. 
ADROVANCE is effective only if taken when your stomach is empty. </p>
<p>If you take more ADROVANCE than you should 
If you take too many tablets by mistake, drink a full glass of milk and contact your doctor 
immediately. Do not make yourself vomit, and do not lie down. </p>
<p>If you forget to take ADROVANCE 
If you miss a dose, just take one tablet on the morning after you remember. Do not take two tablets on 
the same day. Return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on your chosen day. </p>
<p>If you stop taking ADROVANCE 
It is important that you take ADROVANCE for as long as your doctor prescribes the medicine. Since 
it is not known how long you should take ADROVANCE, you should discuss the need to stay on this 
medicine with your doctor periodically to determine if ADROVANCE is still right for you. </p>
<p>An Instruction Card is included in the carton for ADROVANCE. It contains important information 
reminding you how to take ADROVANCE properly. </p>
