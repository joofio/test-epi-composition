Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A 
(inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. </p>
<p>ADYNOVI is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients from 12 years of age with 
haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). </p>         </div>"""

<li>if you are allergic to rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) </li>
<li>if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your ADYNOVI. So, every time you get a 
new package of ADYNOVI, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after {abbreviation used for batch number}) and keep this information in a safe place. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using ADYNOVI. </p>
<p>There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADYNOVI. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, 
hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, 
tightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms 
of anaphylactic shock; additional symptoms may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and 
extreme difficulty in breathing. </p>
<p>If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. </p>
<p>If you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood 
clotting (coagulation) complications. </p>
<p>Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child s bleeding is not being controlled with ADYNOVI, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Catheter-related complications<br />
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The listed warnings and 
precautions also apply to adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ADYNOVI </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia A occurs only rarely in women. 
Therefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during pregnancy and breast-feeding is 
available. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>ADYNOVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>ADYNOVI contains sodium </p>
<p>ADYNOVI contains up to 12.42 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.62% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Depending on your body weight and your dose of ADYNOVI, you could receive multiple vials. This 
should be taken into consideration if you are on a low salt diet.  </p>         </div>"""

of patients with haemophilia A. </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADYNOVI depending on your condition and body weight, 
and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will 
depend on how well ADYNOVI is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with 
ADYNOVI is a life-long treatment. </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of ADYNOVI is 40 to 50 IU per kg body weight, administered 2 times per week. </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of ADYNOVI is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. 
If you think that the effect of ADYNOVI is insufficient, talk to your doctor. 
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents </p>
<p>ADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents 
is also calculated to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. </p>
<p>How ADYNOVI is given </p>
<p>ADYNOVI is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone 
else might also administer ADYNOVI as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. 
Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. </p>
<p>If you use more ADYNOVI than you should </p>
<p>Always use ADYNOVI exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADYNOVI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to use ADYNOVI </p>
<p>Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop using ADYNOVI </p>
<p>Do not stop using ADYNOVI without consulting your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
