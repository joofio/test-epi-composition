<p>AFSTYLA is used to treat and prevent bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A (inborn factor 
VIII deficiency). Factor VIII is a protein needed for blood to clot. Patients with haemophilia A lack 
this factor, so blood does not clot as quickly as it should and they have an increased tendency to bleed. 
AFSTYLA works by replacing the missing factor VIII in haemophilia A patients enabling their blood 
to clot normally. </p>
<p>AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Traceability 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your AFSTYLA. 
So, every time you get a new package of AFSTYLA, note down the date and the batch number (which 
is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using AFSTYLA. </p>
<ul>
<li>Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. The product contain traces of hamster proteins 
(see also “Do not use AFSTYLA”). If symptoms of allergic reactions occur, stop using the 
medicine immediately and contact your doctor. Your doctor should inform you of the early 
signs of allergic reactions. These include hives, generalised skin rash, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, fall in blood pressure and anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction that causes severe 
difficulty in breathing, and dizziness).  </li>
<li>The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during 
treatment with all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the 
treatment working properly. You or your child will be monitored carefully for the development 
of inhibitors. If you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with AFSTYLA, tell your 
doctor immediately.  </li>
<li>If you or your child have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, tell 
your doctor or pharmacist. </li>
<li>If a central venous access device (CVAD) is used for injection of AFSTYLA, the risk of 
complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and the formation of 
a blood clot (thrombosis) in the blood vessel where it is inserted should be considered by your 
doctor and discussed with you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and AFSTYLA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
<em> If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.<br />
</em> During pregnancy and breast-feeding, AFSTYLA should be given only if it is clearly needed. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
AFSTYLA does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>AFSTYLA contains sodium 
AFSTYLA contains up to 35.0 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial.  This 
is equivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.   </p>         </div>"""

<p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>Dose 
The amount of AFSTYLA you or your child need to take and the duration of treatment depend on: 
* the severity of your disease 
* the site and intensity of the bleeding 
* your clinical condition and response 
* your body weight </p>
<p>Follow the directions given to you by your doctor. </p>
<p>Reconstitution and administration </p>
<p>General instructions 
* The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic 
conditions. 
* AFSTYLA must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in 
section 6. * The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e., it might be 
sparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or 
withdrawal (see below) the solution should be checked again, before it is used. Do not use the 
solution if it is visibly cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles. 
* Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements and as instructed by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Reconstitution and administration 
Without opening the vials, ensure the AFSTYLA powder and the liquid is at room or body 
temperature. This can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by 
holding them in your hands for a few minutes.<br />
Do not expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37 °C). </p>
<p>Carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an 
alcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter 
transfer device), then follow the instructions given below. </p>
