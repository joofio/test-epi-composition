<p>AFSTYLA is used to treat and prevent bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A (inborn factor 
VIII deficiency). Factor VIII is a protein needed for blood to clot. Patients with haemophilia A lack 
this factor, so blood does not clot as quickly as it should and they have an increased tendency to bleed. 
AFSTYLA works by replacing the missing factor VIII in haemophilia A patients enabling their blood 
to clot normally. </p>
<p>AFSTYLA can be used for all age groups. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Traceability 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your AFSTYLA. 
So, every time you get a new package of AFSTYLA, note down the date and the batch number (which 
is on the packaging after  Lot ) and keep this information in a safe place. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using AFSTYLA. </p>
<ul>
<li>Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. The product contain traces of hamster proteins 
(see also  Do not use AFSTYLA ). If symptoms of allergic reactions occur, stop using the 
medicine immediately and contact your doctor. Your doctor should inform you of the early 
signs of allergic reactions. These include hives, generalised skin rash, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, fall in blood pressure and anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction that causes severe 
difficulty in breathing, and dizziness).  </li>
<li>The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during 
treatment with all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the 
treatment working properly. You or your child will be monitored carefully for the development 
of inhibitors. If you or your child s bleeding is not being controlled with AFSTYLA, tell your 
doctor immediately.  </li>
<li>If you or your child have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, tell 
your doctor or pharmacist. </li>
<li>If a central venous access device (CVAD) is used for injection of AFSTYLA, the risk of 
complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and the formation of 
a blood clot (thrombosis) in the blood vessel where it is inserted should be considered by your 
doctor and discussed with you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and AFSTYLA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
<em> If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.<br />
</em> During pregnancy and breast-feeding, AFSTYLA should be given only if it is clearly needed. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
AFSTYLA does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>AFSTYLA contains sodium 
AFSTYLA contains up to 35.0 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial.  This 
is equivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.   </p>         </div>"""

<p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>Dose 
The amount of AFSTYLA you or your child need to take and the duration of treatment depend on: 
* the severity of your disease 
* the site and intensity of the bleeding 
* your clinical condition and response 
* your body weight </p>
<p>Follow the directions given to you by your doctor. 
Reconstitution and administration </p>
<p>General instructions 
* The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic 
conditions. 
* AFSTYLA must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in 
section 6. * The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e., it might be 
sparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or 
withdrawal (see below) the solution should be checked again, before it is used. Do not use the 
solution if it is visibly cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles. 
* Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements and as instructed by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Reconstitution and administration 
Without opening the vials, ensure the AFSTYLA powder and the liquid is at room or body 
temperature. This can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by 
holding them in your hands for a few minutes.<br />
Do not expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37  C). </p>
<p>Carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an 
alcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter 
transfer device), then follow the instructions given below. </p>
<p>1 
1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do not remove 
the Mix2Vial from the blister package! 
 2 
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister 
package and push the spike of the blue adapter end 
straight down through the solvent vial stopper. 
 3 
3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package and 
not the Mix2Vial set. 
 4 
4. Place the powder vial on an even and firm surface. Invert 
the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push 
the spike of the transparent adapter end straight down 
through the powder vial stopper. The solvent will 
automatically flow into the powder vial. 
 5 
5. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set 
and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and 
unscrew the set carefully counterclockwise into two 
pieces. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached. 
 6 
6. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
attached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not 
shake. 
 7 
7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product 
vial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial's Luer 
Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the 
product vial. </p>
<p>Withdrawal and administration </p>
<p>8 
8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back slowly. 
 9 
9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by 
unscrewing counterclockwise. </p>
<p>Use the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. Let blood flow back 
to the end of the tube. Attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. Inject 
the reconstituted solution slowly (as comfortable for you, up to a maximum of 10 ml/min) into 
the vein following the instructions given to you by your doctor. Take care not to get any blood in the 
syringe containing the product.  </p>
<p>Check yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. If you have any side effects that 
might be related to the administration of AFSTYLA, the injection should be stopped (see also section 
2). 
Use in children and adolescents 
AFSTYLA can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12 higher 
doses or more frequent injections may be needed. Children above 12 years of age can use the same 
dose as adults. </p>
<p>If you use more AFSTYLA than you should 
If you have injected more AFSTYLA than you should, please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to use AFSTYLA<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately 
and continue as advised by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop using AFSTYLA 
If you stop using AFSTYLA you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may 
not stop. Do not stop using AFSTYLA without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) this is 
uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If you or your child has developed an inhibitor with the 
medicine, you may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your 
doctor immediately.  </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 users) 
* tingling or numbness (paraesthesia) 
* rash 
* fever </p>
