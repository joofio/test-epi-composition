<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Aimovig: 
- if you have ever had an allergic reaction to rubber latex. The container of this medicinal product 
contains latex rubber within the cap. 
- if you suffer from a cardiovascular disease. Aimovig has not been studied in patients with 
certain cardiovascular diseases. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or get emergency medical help immediately: 
- if you get any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, such as rash or swelling usually of the 
face, mouth, tongue, or throat; or difficulty breathing. Serious allergic reactions can happen 
within minutes, but some may happen more than one week after using Aimovig. 
- Contact a doctor if you get constipation and seek medical help immediately if you develop 
constipation with severe or constant belly (abdominal) pain and vomiting, swelling of abdomen 
or bloating. Constipation can occur when treated with Aimovig. It is usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. However, some patients using Aimovig have had constipation with serious 
complications and have been hospitalised. Some cases have required surgery. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents (under 18 years old) because the use of Aimovig 
has not been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Aimovig 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Your doctor will decide whether you should stop using Aimovig during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Monoclonal antibodies like Aimovig are known to pass into breast milk during the first few days after 
birth, but after this first period Aimovig can be used. Talk to your doctor about using Aimovig while 
breast-feeding in order to help you decide whether you should stop breast-feeding or stop using 
Aimovig. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Aimovig is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Aimovig contains sodium 
Aimovig contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-free”. </p>         </div>"""

sure. </p>
<p>If your doctor prescribes the 70 mg dose you should have one injection once every 4 weeks. If your 
doctor prescribes the 140 mg dose you should have either one injection of Aimovig 140 mg or two 
injections of Aimovig 70 mg once every 4 weeks. If you are having two injections of Aimovig 70 mg, 
the second injection must be given immediately after the first one at a different injection site. Make 
sure that you inject the entire contents of both syringes. </p>
<p>Aimovig is given as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). You or your 
caregiver can give the injection into your abdomen or your thigh. The outer area of your upper arm can 
also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the injection. If you need 
2 injections, they should be given in different sites to avoid hardening of the skin and should not be 
given into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will give you or your caregiver training in the right way to prepare and inject 
Aimovig. Do not try to inject Aimovig until this training has been given. </p>
<p>If you have not noticed any treatment effect after 3 months, tell your doctor who will decide whether 
you should continue treatment. </p>
<p>Aimovig syringes are for single use only. </p>
<p>For detailed instructions on how to inject Aimovig, see “Instructions for use of Aimovig pre-filled 
syringe” at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>If you use more Aimovig than you should 
If you have received more Aimovig than you should or if the dose has been given earlier than it should 
have been, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Aimovig 
- If you forget an Aimovig dose, take it as soon as possible after you realise. 
- Then contact your doctor, who will tell you when you should schedule your next dose. Follow 
the new schedule exactly as your doctor has told you. </p>
<p>If you stop using Aimovig 
Do not stop using Aimovig without talking to your doctor first. Your symptoms may return if you stop 
the treatment. </p>
