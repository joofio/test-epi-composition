  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Aldara cream may be used for three different conditions. Your doctor may prescribe Aldara cream for 
the treatment of: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Warts (condylomata acuminata) on the surface of the genitals (sexual organs) and around the 
anus (back passage) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superficial basal cell carcinoma.<br />
This is a common slow-growing form of skin cancer with a very small likelihood of spread to 
other parts of the body. It usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly people, especially those 
who are fair-skinned and is caused by too much sun exposure. If left untreated, basal cell 
carcinoma can disfigure, especially on the face – therefore early recognition and treatment are 
important. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actinic keratosis 
Actinic keratoses are rough areas of skin found in people who have been exposed to a lot of 
sunshine over the course of their lifetime. Some are skin coloured, others are greyish, pink, 
red or brown. They can be flat and scaly, or raised, rough, hard and warty. Aldara should only 
be used for flat actinic keratoses on the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune 
system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aldara cream helps your body´s own immune system to produce natural substances which help fight 
your basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis or the virus that has caused your warts.  </p>         </div>"""

<li>if you are allergic to imiquimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Aldara cream 
* If you have previously used Aldara cream or other similar preparations tell your doctor before 
starting this treatment. 
* If you suffer from autoimmune disorders<br />
* If you have had an organ transplant 
* Do not use Aldara cream until the area to be treated has healed after previous drug or surgical 
treatment. 
* Avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nostrils. In the event of accidental contact, remove cream 
by rinsing with water. 
* Do not apply the cream internally. 
* Do not use more cream than your doctor has advised. 
* Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings after you have applied Aldara 
cream. 
* If the treated site becomes too uncomfortable, wash the cream off with mild soap and water. 
As soon as the problem has stopped you may restart to apply the cream. 
* Tell your doctor if you have an abnormal blood count. </p>
<p>Because of the way Aldara works, there is a possibility that the cream may worsen existing 
inflammation in the treatment area. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are being treated for genital warts follow these additional precautions: </li>
</ul>
<p>Men with warts under the foreskin should pull the foreskin back each day and wash underneath 
it. If not washed daily the foreskin may be more likely to show signs of tightness, swelling and 
wearing away of the skin and result in difficulty in pulling it back. If these symptoms occur, 
stop the treatment immediately and call your doctor. 
If you have open sores: do not start using Aldara cream until after the sores have healed. 
If you have internal warts: do not use Aldara cream in the urethra (the hole from which urine is 
passed), the vagina (birth canal), the cervix (internal female organ), or anywhere inside your 
anus (rectum). 
Do not use this medication for more than one course if you have problems with your immune 
system, either due to illness or because of the medicines you are already taking. If you think this 
applies to you talk to your doctor. 
If you are HIV positive you should inform your doctor as Aldara cream has not been shown to 
be as effective in HIV positive patients.<br />
If you decide to have sexual relations while you still have warts, apply Aldara cream after - not 
before - sexual activity. Aldara cream may weaken condoms and diaphragms, therefore the 
cream should not be left on during sexual activity. Remember, Aldara cream does not protect 
against giving HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases to someone else. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are being treated for basal cell carcinoma or actinic keratosis follow these additional 
precautions: </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use sunlamps or tanning beds, and avoid sunlight as much as possible during treatment 
with Aldara cream. Wear protective clothing and wide brimmed hats when outdoors. </p>
<p>Whilst using Aldara cream and until healed, the treatment area is likely to appear noticeably different 
from normal skin. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Aldara cream  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
There are no medicines known to be incompatible with Aldara cream. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss 
the risks and benefits of using Aldara cream during pregnancy. Studies in animals do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects in pregnancy. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether 
imiquimod is secreted in human milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Aldara cream contains methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, cetyl alcohol, stearyl 
alcohol and benzyl alcohol </p>
<p>Methyl hydroxybenzoate (E 218) and propyl hydroxybenzoate (E 216) may cause allergic reactions 
(possibly delayed). Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact 
dermatitis). 
This medicine contains 5 mg benzyl alcohol in each sachet. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions and mild local irritation. </p>         </div>"""
