  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Aldara cream may be used for three different conditions. Your doctor may prescribe Aldara cream for 
the treatment of: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Warts (condylomata acuminata) on the surface of the genitals (sexual organs) and around the 
anus (back passage) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superficial basal cell carcinoma.<br />
This is a common slow-growing form of skin cancer with a very small likelihood of spread to 
other parts of the body. It usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly people, especially those 
who are fair-skinned and is caused by too much sun exposure. If left untreated, basal cell 
carcinoma can disfigure, especially on the face   therefore early recognition and treatment are 
important. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actinic keratosis 
Actinic keratoses are rough areas of skin found in people who have been exposed to a lot of 
sunshine over the course of their lifetime. Some are skin coloured, others are greyish, pink, 
red or brown. They can be flat and scaly, or raised, rough, hard and warty. Aldara should only 
be used for flat actinic keratoses on the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune 
system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aldara cream helps your body s own immune system to produce natural substances which help fight 
your basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis or the virus that has caused your warts.  </p>         </div>"""

6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Aldara cream 
* If you have previously used Aldara cream or other similar preparations tell your doctor before 
starting this treatment. 
* If you suffer from autoimmune disorders<br />
* If you have had an organ transplant 
* Do not use Aldara cream until the area to be treated has healed after previous drug or surgical 
treatment. 
* Avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nostrils. In the event of accidental contact, remove cream 
by rinsing with water. 
* Do not apply the cream internally. 
* Do not use more cream than your doctor has advised. 
* Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings after you have applied Aldara 
cream. 
* If the treated site becomes too uncomfortable, wash the cream off with mild soap and water. 
As soon as the problem has stopped you may restart to apply the cream. 
* Tell your doctor if you have an abnormal blood count. </p>
<p>Because of the way Aldara works, there is a possibility that the cream may worsen existing 
inflammation in the treatment area. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are being treated for genital warts follow these additional precautions: </li>
</ul>
<p>Men with warts under the foreskin should pull the foreskin back each day and wash underneath 
it. If not washed daily the foreskin may be more likely to show signs of tightness, swelling and 
wearing away of the skin and result in difficulty in pulling it back. If these symptoms occur, 
stop the treatment immediately and call your doctor. 
If you have open sores: do not start using Aldara cream until after the sores have healed. 
If you have internal warts: do not use Aldara cream in the urethra (the hole from which urine is 
passed), the vagina (birth canal), the cervix (internal female organ), or anywhere inside your 
anus (rectum). 
Do not use this medication for more than one course if you have problems with your immune 
system, either due to illness or because of the medicines you are already taking. If you think this 
applies to you talk to your doctor. 
If you are HIV positive you should inform your doctor as Aldara cream has not been shown to 
be as effective in HIV positive patients.<br />
If you decide to have sexual relations while you still have warts, apply Aldara cream after - not 
before - sexual activity. Aldara cream may weaken condoms and diaphragms, therefore the 
cream should not be left on during sexual activity. Remember, Aldara cream does not protect 
against giving HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases to someone else. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are being treated for basal cell carcinoma or actinic keratosis follow these additional 
precautions: </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use sunlamps or tanning beds, and avoid sunlight as much as possible during treatment 
with Aldara cream. Wear protective clothing and wide brimmed hats when outdoors. </p>
<p>Whilst using Aldara cream and until healed, the treatment area is likely to appear noticeably different 
from normal skin. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Aldara cream  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
There are no medicines known to be incompatible with Aldara cream. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss 
the risks and benefits of using Aldara cream during pregnancy. Studies in animals do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects in pregnancy. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether 
imiquimod is secreted in human milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Aldara cream contains methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, cetyl alcohol, stearyl 
alcohol and benzyl alcohol </p>
<p>Methyl hydroxybenzoate (E 218) and propyl hydroxybenzoate (E 216) may cause allergic reactions 
(possibly delayed). Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact 
dermatitis). 
This medicine contains 5 mg benzyl alcohol in each sachet. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions and mild local irritation. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Aldara 
cream.<br />
Some patients have experienced changes in skin colour in the area where Aldara cream was applied. 
While these changes have tended to improve with time, in some patients they may be permanent. 
If your skin reacts badly when using Aldara cream, stop applying the cream, wash the area with mild 
soap and water and contact your doctor or pharmacist.<br />
In some individuals a lowering of blood counts was noted. A lowering of blood counts might make 
you more susceptible to infections, make you bruise more easily or cause fatigue. If you notice any of 
these symptoms, tell your doctor. 
Some patients who suffer from autoimmune disorders may experience worsening of their condition. If 
you notice any change during treatment with Aldara cream, tell your doctor. 
Serious skin reactions have been reported rarely. If you experience skin lesions or spots on your skin that 
start out as small red areas and progress to look like mini targets, possibly with symptoms such as 
itching, fever, overall ill feeling, achy joints, vision problems, burning, painful or itchy eyes and mouth 
sores, stop using Aldara cream and tell your doctor immediately. 
A small number of patients have experienced hair loss at the treatment site or surrounding area. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for genital warts: </p>
<p>Many of the undesirable effects of Aldara cream are due to its local action on your skin. </p>
<p>Very common effects include redness (61% patients), wearing away of the skin (30% patients), 
flakiness and swelling. Hardening under the skin, small open sores, a crust that forms during healing, 
and small bubbles under the skin may also occur. You might also feel itching (32% patients), a 
burning sensation (26% patients) or pain in areas where you have applied Aldara cream (8% patients). 
Most of these skin reactions are mild and the skin will return to normal within about 2 weeks after 
stopping treatment.  </p>

flushing; tiredness; dizziness; migraine; pins and needles; insomnia; depression; loss of appetite; swollen 
glands; bacterial, viral and fungal infections (e.g. cold sores); vaginal infection including thrush; cough 
and colds with sore throat. </p>
<p>Very rarely severe and painful reactions have occurred, particularly when more cream has been used 
than recommended. Painful skin reactions at the opening of the vagina have very rarely made it difficult 
for some women to pass urine. If this occurs you should seek medical help immediately. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for basal cell carcinoma: </p>
<p>Many of the undesirable effects of Aldara cream are due to its local action on your skin. Local skin 
reactions can be a sign that the drug is working as intended. </p>
<p>Very Commonly the treated skin may be slightly itchy.  </p>
<p>Common effects include: pins and needles, small swollen areas in the skin, pain, burning, irritation, 
bleeding, redness or rash.<br />

swelling, scabbing, skin breakdown, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, feeling sick, dry mouth, flu-like 
symptoms and tiredness. </p>
