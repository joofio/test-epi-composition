<p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to pemetrexed or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
-<br />
if you are breast-feeding; you must discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with ALIMTA. 
-<br />
if you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or hospital pharmacist before receiving ALIMTA. </p>
<p>If you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or 
hospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive ALIMTA. 
Before each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient 
kidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive ALIMTA. Your 
doctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition and if 
your blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make sure that 
you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving cisplatin to 
prevent vomiting. </p>
<p>If you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early 
or late radiation reaction with ALIMTA. </p>
<p>If you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects 
with ALIMTA. </p>
<p>If you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid 
before giving you ALIMTA. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this 
medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ALIMTA 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as 
medicines called  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs), including medicines purchased 
without a doctor s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There are many sorts of NSAIDs with different 
durations of activity. Based on the planned date of your infusion of ALIMTA and/or on the status of 
your kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you 
can take them. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are NSAIDs. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. The 
use of ALIMTA should be avoided during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential 
risk of taking ALIMTA during pregnancy. Women must use effective contraception during treatment 
with ALIMTA and for 6 months after receiving the last dose. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor.<br />
Breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with ALIMTA. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Men are advised not to father a child during and up to 3 months following treatment with ALIMTA 
and should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for up to 3 
months afterwards. If you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the 3 months 
following receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. ALIMTA can affect your 
ability to have children. Talk to your doctor to seek advice about sperm storage before starting your 
therapy. </p>

height and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. Your doctor will use this 
body surface area to work out the right dose for you.  This dose may be adjusted, or treatment may be 
delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. A hospital pharmacist, 
nurse or doctor will have mixed the ALIMTA powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride solution

an injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of ALIMTA and then
