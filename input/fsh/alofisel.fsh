the fat tissue of a healthy adult donor (so-called allogenic stem cells) and then grown in a laboratory. 
Adult stem cells are a special type of cells found in many adult tissues, whose primary role is the 
repair of the tissue in which they are found.  </p>
<p>Alofisel is a medicine used for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with 
Crohn´s disease (a disease causing inflammation of the gut) when the other symptoms of the disease 
are controlled or have a mild intensity. Perianal fistulas are abnormal channels that connect parts of 
the lower bowel (rectum and anus) and the skin near the anus, so that one or more openings appear 
near the anus. Perianal fistulas are described as complex if they have multiple channels and openings, 
if they penetrate deep inside your body or if they are associated with other complications such as 
collections of pus (infected liquid also called abscesses). Perianal fistulas can cause pain, irritation and 
discharge of pus through the openings to the skin. </p>
<p>Alofisel is used when the fistulas have not responded sufficiently well to previous treatment. When 
injected close to the perianal fistulas, Alofisel reduces their inflammation, increasing the likelihood of 
the fistulas healing. </p>         </div>"""

<p>− 
if you are allergic to darvadstrocel, bovine serum or to any of the ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or surgeon before you are given Alofisel. </p>
<p>Alofisel may contain traces of either gentamicin or benzylpenicillin and streptomycin (antibiotics). 
This should be considered if you are allergic to these antibiotics, as these antibiotics are used in the 
manufacturing process of this medicine. </p>
<p>Alofisel is a living cell therapy and, therefore, the final product cannot be sterilised. The product is 
checked at different stages during its manufacture to ensure that it is free of infection. Because the 
final check takes place just before Alofisel is sent to the hospital, the results of this last check are not 
known when it is given to you. In the unlikely event that the results detected an infection, your 
treatment team will be informed who will tell you if you need any laboratory tests of treatment for the 
infection. If after the procedure you feel ill or have fever, please inform your physician as soon as you 
can. </p>
<p>Before receiving Alofisel you will undergo the preparation of your fistulas. You may experience pain 
in the rectum or anus, and pain occurring after fistula preparation. </p>
<p>After you receive Alofisel do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplants. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. It is not known 
if this medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor/surgeon for advice before you are given this medicine. Treatment with Alofisel is not 
recommended during pregnancy. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception 
during treatment with Alofisel.  </p>
<p>The effect of Alofisel on breast-feeding women is not known, and it may harm your breast-fed child. 
Your doctor will help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Alofisel, 
considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Alofisel to the mother.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Alofisel is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>You may have had an initial consultation with the Surgeon 2 to 3 weeks prior to Alofisel 
administration. The following information is related to the day when Alofisel is administered. </p>
<p>Alofisel is injected by a surgeon in the fistula tract tissue.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 4 vials of 6 mL (120 × 106 cells). </p>
<p>Before treatment with Alofisel, you will be given an anaesthetic.  </p>
<p>Once you have been anaesthetised (general or regional anaesthesia), your surgeon will: 
* prepare the fistulas with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution and remove any scar tissue. 
* stitch up the inner openings of the fistulas. 
* inject Alofisel. Half of the dose will be injected into the tissue around the inner openings of the 
fistulas, and half of the dose in the tissue walls along the fistulas. 
* massage softly for 20 to 30 seconds the area where the fistula opens on to the skin near your 
anus. </p>

<p>− 
The active ingredient is darvadstrocel which consists of human stem cells obtained from the fat 
tissue of a healthy adult donor that are subsequently grown (expanded) in the laboratory and 
provided at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells per millilitre in vials which each contain 
6 millilitres, i.e. 30 × 106 cells per vial. 
− 
There are two excipients used for storage of the cells: one is a liquid called Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle´s Medium containing nutrients for the cells (amino acids, vitamins, salts and 
carbohydrates), and the other is human albumin, which is a natural protein found in the human 
body. </p>
<p>What Alofisel looks like and contents of the pack </p>
<p>Alofisel is a dispersion for injection. During shipment, the cells may have settled in the bottom of the 
vials forming a sediment and will need to be resuspended. After the cells have been resuspended (by 
gentle manual tapping), Alofisel is a white to yellowish homogenous dispersion. </p>
<p>Alofisel is supplied on an individual patient basis. An individual dose of Alofisel comprises 4 glass 
vials each containing 6 millilitres of Alofisel contained within a cardboard box. </p>
