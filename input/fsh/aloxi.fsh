You will not be given Aloxi if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Aloxi if: 
* you have a blocked bowel or have had repeated constipation in the past<br />

beat ( QT prolongation )

<p>Other medicines and Aloxi 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. In 
particular, tell them if you are taking the following medicines: </p>
<p>Medicines for depression or anxiety 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines for depression or anxiety, including: 
  medicines called SSRIs ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors )   such as fluoxetine, 
paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram<br />
* medicines called SNRIs ( serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors )   such as venlafaxine, 
duloxetine (can lead to the development of serotonin syndrome and should be used with caution). </p>
<p>Medicines that can affect your heart beat 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that affect your heart beat   this is because 
they could cause a heart beat problem when taken with Aloxi. This includes: 
  medicines for heart problems such as amiodarone, nicardipine, quinidine 
  medicines for infections such as moxifloxacin, erythromycin 
  medicines for serious mental health problems such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, quetiapine, 
thioridazine<br />
  a medicine for feeling or being sick (nausea and vomiting) called domperidone. 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before taking 
Aloxi   this is because these medicines could cause a heart beat problem when taken with Aloxi. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant, your doctor will not give you Aloxi unless it is 
clearly necessary. This is because we do not know if Aloxi may harm the baby. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or nurse for advice before being given this medicine if you are pregnant or think you 
might be. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if Aloxi is found in breast milk. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or nurse for advice before being given this medicine if you are breast-feeding. </p>

tools or machines. </p>
