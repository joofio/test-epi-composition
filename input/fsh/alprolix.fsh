bleeding. </p>
<p>ALPROLIX is a medicine used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in all age groups of patients 
with haemophilia B (inherited bleeding disorder caused by factor IX deficiency). </p>
<p>ALPROLIX is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived 
components in the manufacturing process.  </p>
<p>How ALPROLIX works 
In patients with haemophilia B, factor IX is missing or not working properly. This medicine is used to 
replace the missing or deficient factor IX. ALPROLIX increases factor IX level in the blood and temporarily 
corrects the bleeding tendency. The Fc fusion protein in this medicine increases the length of time that the 
medicine works. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ALPROLIX. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a small chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ALPROLIX. Signs of allergic reactions may include, generalised itching, hives, tightness 
of the chest, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If any of these symptoms occur, stop the 
injection immediately and contact your doctor. Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, 
your initial administrations of ALPROLIX should be performed under medical observation where 
proper medical care for allergic reactions can be provided. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding is not being controlled with the dose you receive, as 
there can be several reasons for this. For example, the formation of antibodies (also known as 
inhibitors) to factor IX is a known complication that can occur during the treatment of haemophilia B. 
The antibodies prevent the treatment from working properly. This would be checked by your doctor. 
Do not increase the total dose of ALPROLIX to control your bleed without talking to your doctor.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Patients with a factor IX inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with 
factor IX. Therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as those described above, you should be tested 
for the presence of an inhibitor.  </p>
<p>Factor IX products may increase the risk of unwanted blood clots in your body, especially if you have risk 
factors for developing blood clots. Symptoms of a possible unwanted blood clot may include: pain and/or 
tenderness along a vein, unexpected swelling of an arm or leg or sudden shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing. </p>
<p>Cardiovascular events 
If you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, take special care when using 
factor IX and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Catheter-related complications 
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site blood clots should be considered. </p>
<p>Documentation 
It is strongly recommended that every time ALPROLIX is given, the name and batch number of the product 
are recorded. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ALPROLIX 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
ALPROLIX has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>ALPROLIX contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial that is to say essentially “sodium free”. In 
case of treatment with multiple vials, the total sodium content should be taken into consideration. </p>         </div>"""

haemophilia. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you (see section 7). Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. </p>
<p>ALPROLIX is given as an injection into a vein. You or somebody else may administer it after receiving 
adequate training. Your doctor will decide the dose (in International Units or “IU”) you will receive. The 
dose will depend on your individual needs for replacement factor IX therapy and on whether it is used for 
prevention or treatment of bleeding. Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding is not being 
controlled with the dose you receive. </p>
<p>How often you need an injection will depend on how well the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will 
perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor IX levels in your blood.  </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding<br />
The dose of ALPROLIX is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor IX levels to be 
achieved. The target factor IX levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding<br />
If you are using ALPROLIX to prevent bleeding, your doctor will calculate the dose for you.  </p>
<p>The usual dose of ALPROLIX is 50 IU per kg of body weight, given once a week or 100 IU per kg of body 
weight, given once every 10 days. The dose or interval may be adjusted by your doctor. In some cases, 
especially in younger patients, shorter dosing intervals or higher doses may be necessary. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
ALPROLIX can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12 years, higher 
doses or more frequent injections may be needed and the usual dose is 50 to 60 IU per kg of body weight, 
given once every 7 days.  </p>
<p>If you use more ALPROLIX than you should 
Tell your doctor as soon as possible. You should always use ALPROLIX exactly as your doctor has told you, 
check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use ALPROLIX 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take your dose as soon as you remember and 
then resume your normal dosing schedule. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.  </p>
<p>If you stop using ALPROLIX 
Do not stop using ALPROLIX without consulting your doctor. If you stop using ALPROLIX you may no 
longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not stop. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
