Alunbrig is used to treat adults with advanced stages of a lung cancer called non-small cell lung 
cancer. It is given to patients whose lung cancer is related to an abnormal form of a gene called 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). </p>
<p>How Alunbrig works </p>
<p>The abnormal gene produces a protein known as a kinase that stimulates the growth of the cancer 
cells. Alunbrig blocks the action of this protein and thus slows down the growth and spread of the 
cancer. </p>         </div>"""
