  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Alymsys contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a 
type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection 
and cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF 
protein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with 
nutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking 
the growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. </p>
<p>Alymsys is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large 
bowel, i.e., in the colon or rectum. Alymsys will be administered in combination with chemotherapy 
treatment containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine. </p>
<p>Alymsys is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for 
patients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called 
paclitaxel or capecitabine. </p>
<p>Alymsys is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
Alymsys will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. </p>
<p>Alymsys is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
when cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR). Alymsys will be administered in combination with erlotinib. </p>
<p>Alymsys is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for 
patients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. </p>
<p>Alymsys is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Alymsys will be administered in 
combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. </p>
<p>When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Alymsys will be administered in 
combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. </p>
<p>Alymsys is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer. Alymsys will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, 
paclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Alymsys: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alymsys may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you have conditions 
causing inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, colitis associated 
with chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway between 
two organs or vessels. The risk of developing connections between the vagina and any parts of 
the gut can increase if you have persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys can increase the risk of bleeding or increase the risk of problems with wound healing 
after surgery. If you are going to have an operation, if you have had major surgery within the 
last 28 days or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery, you should not receive 
this medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys may increase the risk of developing serious infections of the skin or deeper layers 
under the skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure 
which is not well controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your doctor as it is 
important to make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting Alymsys 
treatment.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys increases the risk of having protein in your urine especially if you already have high 
blood pressure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk of developing blood clots in your arteries (a type of blood vessel) can increase if you 
are over 65 years old, if you have diabetes, or if you have had previous blood clots in your 
arteries. Please talk to your doctor since blood clots can lead to heart attack and stroke. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys can also increase the risk of developing blood clots in your veins (a type of blood 
vessel). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys may cause bleeding, especially tumour-related bleeding. Please consult your doctor if 
you or your family tend to suffer from bleeding problems or you are taking medicines to thin the 
blood for any reason. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys may cause bleeding in and around your brain. Please discuss this with your doctor if 
you have metastatic cancer affecting your brain. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys can increase the risk of bleeding in your lungs, including coughing or spitting blood. 
Please discuss with your doctor if you noticed this previously. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys can increase the risk of developing a weak heart. It is important that your doctor 
knows if you have ever received anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin, a specific type of 
chemotherapy used to treat some cancers) or had radiotherapy to your chest, or if you have heart 
disease. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys may cause infections and a decreased number of your neutrophils (a type of blood cell 
important for your protection against bacteria). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alymsys can cause hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic shock) and/or infusion reactions 
(reactions related to your injection of the medicine). Please let your doctor, pharmacist or nurse 
know if you have previously experienced problems after injections, such as dizziness/feeling of 
fainting, breathlessness, swelling or skin rash. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
has been associated with Alymsys treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, confusion 
or seizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Death of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw has been reported in patients 
under 18 years old when treated with Alymsys. Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or 
sores inside the mouth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth 
could be signs and symptoms of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and 
dentist immediately if you experience any of them. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past. 
Before you are given Alymsys or while you are being treated with Alymsys: 
* if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, 
numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your doctor and 
dentist immediately. 
* if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you 
are being treated with Alymsys, in particular when you are also receiving or have received an 
injection of bisphosphonate into your blood. </p>
<p>You may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with Alymsys. </p>
<p>Alymsys has been developed and made to treat cancer by injecting it into the bloodstream. It has not 
been developed or made for injection into the eye. It is therefore not authorised to be used in this way. 
When Alymsys is injected directly into the eye (unapproved use), the following side effects may occur: 
* Infection or inflammation of the eye globe, 
* Redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain, 
* Seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision, 
* Increased eye pressure, 
* Bleeding in the eye. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Alymsys use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the 
safety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Alymsys 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Combinations of Alymsys with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and 
gastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you 
do not combine these medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast 
cancer. These therapies in combination with Alymsys may increase the risk of severe side effects. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. Alymsys may cause damage to your unborn baby 
as it may stop the formation of new blood vessels. Your doctor should advise you about using 
contraception during treatment with Alymsys and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Alymsys. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You must not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Alymsys and for at least 6 months after the 
last dose of Alymsys, as this medicine may interfere with the growth and development of your baby. </p>
<p>Alymsys may impair female fertility. Please consult your doctor for more information.  </p>
<p>Pre-menopausal women (women who have a menstrual cycle) may notice that their periods become 
irregular or are missed and may experience impaired fertility. If you are considering having children 
you should discuss this with your doctor before your treatment starts. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Alymsys has not been shown to reduce your ability to drive or to use any tools or machines. However, 
sleepiness and fainting have been reported with Alymsys use. If you experience symptoms that affect 
your vision or concentration, or your ability to react, do not drive and use machines until symptoms 
disappear. </p>
<p>Alymsys contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>If a dose of Alymsys is missed 
* your doctor will decide when you should be given your next dose of Alymsys. You should 
discuss this with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop treatment with Alymsys 
Stopping your treatment with Alymsys may stop the effect on tumour growth. Do not stop treatment 
with Alymsys unless you have discussed this with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
