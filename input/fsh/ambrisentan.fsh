called other antihypertensives (used to treat high blood pressure). </p>
<p>It is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults. PAH is high blood pressure in the 
blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. In people with PAH, 
these arteries get narrower, so the heart has to work harder to pump blood through them. This causes 
people to feel tired, dizzy and short of breath. </p>
<p>Ambrisentan Mylan widens the pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood 
through them. 
This lowers the blood pressure and relieves the symptoms. </p>
<p>Ambrisentan Mylan may also be used in combination with other medicines used to treat PAH. </p>         </div>"""
