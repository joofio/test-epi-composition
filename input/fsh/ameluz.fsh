* slightly palpable to moderately thick actinic keratoses or entire fields affected by actinic 
keratoses in adults. Actinic keratoses are certain changes in the outer layer of the skin that can 
lead to skin cancer. 
* superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to 
possible treatment-related morbidity and/or poor cosmetic outcome in adults. Basal cell 
carcinoma is a skin cancer that can cause reddish, scaly patches or one or several small bumps 
that bleed easily and do not heal.  </p>
<p>After application, the active substance of Ameluz becomes a photoactive substance which accumulates 
in affected cells. Illumination with appropriate light produces reactive oxygen-containing molecules 
which act against the target cells. This therapy is known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). </p>         </div>"""

<p>soya or peanuts 
* if you have impaired formation of red blood pigment called porphyria 
* if you have other skin conditions caused by, or made worse by, exposure to light </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Ameluz. 
* In very rare cases photodynamic therapy may increase the risk of developing temporary 
memory loss.<br />
* The use of Ameluz is not recommended if you use immunosuppressants. 
* Avoid applying Ameluz  </p>
<p>to bleeding lesions </p>
<p>into eyes or to mucous membranes </p>
<p>on skin areas affected by other diseases or tattoos, because this may hinder the success 
and assessment of the treatment. 
* Discontinue any UV-therapy before treatment. 
* Avoid sun exposure on the treated lesion sites and surrounding skin for approximately 48 hours 
following treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Actinic keratoses and basal cell carcinomas do not occur in children and adolescents, except in 
extremely rare cases. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ameluz 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Inform your doctor if you use medicines that increase allergic or other harmful reactions after light 
exposure, such as 
* St. John s wort or its preparations: medicines to treat depression<br />
* griseofulvin: a medicine to treat fungal infections 
* medicines to increase water output through your kidneys with active substance names mostly 
ending in  thiazide  or  tizide , such as hydrochlorothiazide 
* certain medicines to treat diabetes, such as glibenclamide, glimepiride 
* medicines to treat mental disorders, nausea or vomiting with active substance names mostly 
ending in  azine , such as phenothiazine 
* medicines to treat bacterial infection with active substance names beginning with  sulfa  or 
ending in  oxacin  or  cycline , such as tetracycline </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ameluz is not recommended during pregnancy, due to insufficient knowledge. 
Breast-feeding should be interrupted for 12 hours after application of Ameluz. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ameluz has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Ameluz contains 
* 2.4 mg sodium benzoate (E211) in each gram of gel. Sodium benzoate may cause local 
irritation. 
* soybean phosphatidylcholine: If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. 
* propylene glycol: May cause skin irritation. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Ameluz is only used on the skin. A therapy session can be administered for single or multiple lesions, 
or entire treatment fields.  The illumination source for PDT treatment of actinic keratoses lesions or 
fields can be daylight or a red-light lamp. Your doctor will decide which treatment option to use, 
depending on your lesions.<br />
The illumination source for PDT of actinic keratosis in the body regions trunk, neck and extremities is 
a narrow-spectrum red-light. There are no data of efficacy of broader spectrum lamps or daylight PDT 
in these body regions.  </p>
<p>The illumination source for PDT of basal cell carcinoma is always a red-light lamp.    </p>
<p>Treatment of lesions or fields of actinic keratoses and basal cell carcinoma using a red-light 
lamp </p>
<p>Preparation of the lesions  </p>
<p>The application area is first wiped with an alcohol-soaked cotton pad to degrease the skin. Scales and 
crusts are then carefully removed, and all lesion surfaces are gently roughened. Care is taken to avoid 
bleeding. </p>
<p>Application of the gel<br />
Ameluz is applied to form a film of about 1 mm thickness to the entire lesions or fields and 
approximately 5 mm of the surrounding area using glove-protected fingertips or a spatula. 
Avoid any contact with the eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, mucous membrane or bleeding lesions. A 
distance of at least 1 cm is to be maintained. Rinse with water if such contact occurs. 
The gel is allowed to dry for approximately 10 minutes before placing a light-tight dressing over the 
treatment site. The dressing is removed after 3 hours. The remaining gel is wiped off. </p>
<p>Illumination using a red-light lamp<br />
The use of Ameluz requires specific knowledge in photodynamic therapy as it may necessitate the use 
of a red-light lamp.<br />
Immediately after cleaning, the entire treated area is illuminated using a red light source. Efficacy and 
side effects such as temporary pain are dependent on the light source used. Both patients and 
healthcare professionals should adhere to any safety instructions provided with the light source used 
during therapy. All should wear suitable protective goggles during illumination. There is no need to 
protect healthy untreated skin. </p>
<p>Treatment of lesions and fields of actinic keratoses with daylight </p>
<p>Considerations before treatment<br />
Only use daylight treatment if the weather is suitable to stay comfortably outdoors for two hours (with 
temperatures &gt; 10  C). If the weather is rainy, or is likely to become so, you should not use daylight 
treatment.  </p>
<p>Preparation of the lesions <br />
Apply sunscreen to sun exposed skin for sun protection 15 min before lesion treatment. Only use 
sunscreen with chemical filters and sun protection factor 30 or higher. Do not use sunscreen with 
physical filters such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, as these inhibit light absorption and may therefore 
impact efficacy. 
Then wipe the application area with an alcohol-soaked cotton pad to degrease the skin. Carefully 
removed scales and crusts and gently roughen all lesion surfaces. Take care to avoid bleeding.  </p>
<p>Application of the gel 
Apply Ameluz to form a thin layer to the entire lesions or fields and approximately 5 mm of the 
surrounding area using glove-protected fingertips or a spatula. <br />
Avoid any contact with the eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, mucous membrane or bleeding lesions, 
maintaining a distance of at least 1 cm. Rinse with water if such contact occurs. 
A light-tight dressing is not necessary. Do not wipe off the gel during the entire daylight treatment 
session.  </p>
<p>Illumination using daylight for actinic keratosis treatment 
If weather conditions are suitable (please see above; Considerations before treatment), you should go 
outside within 30 minutes after application of the gel and stay for 2 continuous hours in full daylight. 
Taking shelter in the shade in hot weather is acceptable. If the time outdoors is interrupted, you should 
compensate this with a longer illumination time. After the two hour light exposure, wash off the 
remaining gel. </p>
<p>Number of treatments 
* Lesions and fields of actinic keratoses are treated with one session.<br />
* Basal cell carcinoma is treated with two sessions, with an interval of one week between 
sessions.  </p>
<p>The treated lesions should be evaluated 3 months after treatment. Your doctor will decide how well 
each skin lesion has responded, and treatment may have to be repeated at this time.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Side 
effects at the application site occur in about 9 out of 10 users and indicate that the affected cells are 
responding to treatment. </p>
<p>Generally, side effects are of mild or moderate intensity, typically occurring during illumination or 1 
to 4 days after. However, in some cases they may persist for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. In rare cases, 
interruption or discontinuation of illumination may be necessary. After more extended time periods, 
treatment with Ameluz frequently results in continued improvement of skin quality parameters. </p>
<p>The side effects listed below have been reported when using Ameluz with a red-light lamp. The study
