  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>AMGEVITA contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body s immune 
(defence) system.  </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: 
* Rheumatoid arthritis 
* Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
* Enthesitis-related arthritis 
* Ankylosing spondylitis 
* Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis 
* Psoriatic arthritis 
* Plaque psoriasis<br />
<em> Hidradenitis suppurativa 
* Crohn s disease<br />
</em> Ulcerative colitis 
* Non-infectious uveitis </p>
<p>The active ingredient in AMGEVITA, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal 
antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target.  </p>
<p>The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is involved in the 
immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. 
By attaching to TNF , AMGEVITA decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis  </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. 
If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to treat your 
rheumatoid arthritis.  </p>
<p>AMGEVITA can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without 
previous methotrexate treatment. </p>
<p>AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and 
to improve physical function.  </p>
<p>Usually, AMGEVITA is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is 
inappropriate, AMGEVITA can be given alone. </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis  </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of 
the joints that usually first appear in childhood.  </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years and 
enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years. You may first be given other disease-modifying 
medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be 
given AMGEVITA to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.  </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis  </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to 
reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis  </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the 
cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis in adults and children </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery 
scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift 
away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the 
body s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. AMGEVITA is also used 
to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical 
therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. </p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents </p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory 
skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. 
It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner 
thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. 
AMGEVITA can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA. </p>
<p>Crohn s disease in adults and children  </p>
<p>Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat Crohn s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have 
Crohn s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn s disease.  </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis in adults and children  </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children aged 6 to years. If you have ulcerative colitis you may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your 
disease. </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis in adults and children </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  </p>
<p>AMGEVITA is used to treat 
* Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye.<br />
* Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting 
the front of the eye. </p>
<p>This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black 
dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). AMGEVITA works by reducing this 
inflammation. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood infection) or other 
opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system) (see 
 Warnings and precautions ). It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of 
infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems.  </li>
<li>if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AMGEVITA: </p>
<p>Allergic reactions </p>
<ul>
<li>If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash do not inject more AMGEVITA and contact your doctor immediately since, in 
rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Infections </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) 
consult your doctor before starting AMGEVITA. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. </li>
<li>You might get infections more easily while you are receiving AMGEVITA treatment. This risk 
may increase if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include 
tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic 
infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your 
doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor 
may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tuberculosis </p>
<ul>
<li>As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor 
will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting AMGEVITA. This will 
include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening 
tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests 
should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your 
doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis.  </li>
<li>Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative treatment for 
tuberculosis.  </li>
<li>If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other 
infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Travel / recurrent infection </p>
<ul>
<li>Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.  </li>
<li>Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase 
the risk of infections.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis B virus </p>
<ul>
<li>Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV 
or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. 
AMGEVITA can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, 
especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of 
HBV can be life-threatening.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Age over 65 years </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking AMGEVITA. 
You and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being 
treated with AMGEVITA. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, 
such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Surgery or dental procedures </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are 
taking AMGEVITA. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA. </li>
</ul>
<p>Demyelinating disease </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide 
if you should receive or continue to receive AMGEVITA. Tell your doctor immediately if you 
experience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness 
or tingling in any part of your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccinations </p>
<ul>
<li>Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that 
may cause infections and should not be given while receiving AMGEVITA. Please check with 
your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be 
brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines 
prior to initiating AMGEVITA therapy.  </li>
<li>If you received AMGEVITA while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for 
getting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last dose you received 
during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care 
professionals about your AMGEVITA use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your 
baby should receive any vaccine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Heart failure </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with AMGEVITA, your heart failure 
status must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have 
had or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart 
failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor 
immediately. Your doctor will decide if you should receive AMGEVITA. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale </p>
<ul>
<li>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body 
fight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, 
bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may 
decide to stop treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cancer </p>
<ul>
<li>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking 
adalimumab or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had 
the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer 
that affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone 
marrow).  </li>
<li>If you take AMGEVITA the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may 
increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in 
patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-
mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with 
AMGEVITA.  </li>
<li>
<p>In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking 
adalimumab. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change 
appearance, tell your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF 
blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor 
whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Autoimmune diseases </p>
<ul>
<li>On rare occasions, treatment with AMGEVITA could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact 
your doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name 
and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make 
a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
AMGEVITA. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not give AMGEVITA to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the 
age of 2 years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not give AMGEVITA to children with plaque psoriasis below the age of 4 years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not give AMGEVITA to children with Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis below the age of 
6 years.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and AMGEVITA  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>AMGEVITA can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or 
pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  </p>
<p>You should not take AMGEVITA with medicines containing the active substances, anakinra or 
abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its 
use for at least 5 months after the last AMGEVITA treatment. </li>
<li>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice about taking this medicine. </li>
<li>AMGEVITA should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. </li>
<li>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received AMGEVITA during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did 
not receive AMGEVITA. </li>
<li>AMGEVITA can be used during breast-feeding. </li>
<li>If you receive AMGEVITA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for 
getting an infection. </li>
<li>It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals about your 
AMGEVITA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more 
information on vaccines see the  Warnings and precautions  section. </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>AMGEVITA may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room 
spinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking AMGEVITA. </p>
<p>AMGEVITA contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 mL dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
