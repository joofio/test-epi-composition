called sulphonylureas used for lowering blood sugar (blood-glucose). </p>
<p>Amglidia is used in newborns, infants and children to treat diabetes that occurs at birth (known as 
neonatal diabetes mellitus). Neonatal diabetes is a disease where the child’s body does not release 
enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar; Amglidia is used only in patients who still have 
some ability to make insulin. 
Sulphonylureas like glibenclamide have been shown to be effective in certain genetic mutations 
responsible for the genesis of neonatal diabetes. </p>
<p>This medicine is an oral suspension, to be taken by mouth, which is a more convenient treatment for 
newborns and children compared to regular injections of insulin. </p>
<p>You must talk to a doctor if your child does not feel better or if he/she feels worse after a few days. </p>         </div>"""

- if your child is allergic to glibenclamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if your child has ketoacidosis (high blood levels of acid substances called ketones). 
- if your child suffers from porphyria (inability to break down body chemicals called 
porphyrins). 
- if your child is treated with bosentan, e.g. a medicine used to treat problems of blood 
circulation.

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before your child is given Amglidia. </p>
<p>Your child’s blood sugar levels may become too low (hypoglycaemia) after taking Amglidia. Tell the 
doctor if your child is pale, sweating, has irregular heart rhythm or seems disoriented, confused or 
unresponsive. See also section 4. Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). </p>
<p>Ask your doctor to determine at which frequency capillary blood sugar should be checked. </p>
<p>G6PD is an enzyme evolved in sugar metabolism. If your child carries a G6PD enzyme deficiency, 
he/she may experiment an abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (acute haemolytic anaemia) after 
taking Amglidia. 
Tell the doctor if you know that your child is affected by G6PD deficiency and contact him/her if you 
notice that your child is pale as compared to usually. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child suffers from renal or liver disorders. </p>
<p>Your child may experience diarrhoea when the dose of glibenclamide suspension is increased but it 
will be transitory if the dose is maintained. 
Your child may experience nausea. If your child is able to take the glibenclamide suspension, do not 
stop the treatment.<br />
Talk to your doctor if your child experienced vomiting, the doctor may decide to treat your child with 
insulin until vomiting stops in case of major vomiting.<br />
The doctor may also decide to treat your child with an anti-vomiting medicine in case of minor 
vomiting. In this case, Amglidia will be continue.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Amglidia is to be used for newborns, infants and children.  </p>

<p>AMGLIDIA with alcohol </p>
<p>Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may reduce the sugar lowering effect of glibenclamide or 
dangerously potentiate it by delaying its breakdown in the body. Nausea, vomiting, flushing, dizziness, 
headache, chest and abdominal discomfort, and general hangover-like symptoms among others have 
occurred following the concomitant use of alcohol and glibenclamide. Concomitant use of alcohol and 
glibenclamide should be avoided. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>This medicine may only be used for the treatment of neonatal diabetes in newborns, infants and 
children. 
This medicine is not intended to be used in pregnant women and patients planning a pregnancy should 
inform their doctor. It is recommended that such patients change treatment to insulin. 
Breast-feeding seems to be compatible, but as a precautious measure monitoring of the fully breast-fed 
infant’s blood sugar level is advisable. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar in case of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Glibenclamide may increase the risk of low blood sugar and therefore have a moderate influence on 
the ability to drive, to take part in road traffic otherwise or use machines. 
You or your child should avoid activities requiring balance (for example, cycling or skateboarding) 
and driving or using machines if you or your child fee dizzy, tired or unwell. </p>
<p>AMGLIDIA contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains 2.80 mg of sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.1% of the WHO recommended 
daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. To be taken into consideration by patients who have been 
advised to follow a  low salt (sodium) diet. </p>
<p>AMGLIDIA contains benzoate salt 
This medicine contains 5 mg benzoate salt in each mL oral suspension. Benzoate salt may increase 
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old). </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Dose </p>
<p>Glibenclamide therapy should be started by a doctor experienced in the treatment of patients with very 
early onset diabetes. </p>
<p>The dose of Amglidia depends on your child’s body weight, and will be calculated by the doctor as an 
amount (volume) in mL oral suspension to be measured with the oral syringe (either an 1 mL or a 
5 mL syringe) supplied with the medicine. Your doctor will prescribe the specific pack size and 
strength including the particular syringe you should use. Do not use any other syringe to administer 
Amglidia. </p>
<p>It is important you do not adjust yourself the doses of either Amglidia or insulin, unless specifically 
directed to do so by your child’s doctor. </p>
<p>The starting dose of Amglidia is 0.2 mg of glibenclamide for each kilogram (kg) of body weight daily, 
divided in two doses of 0.1 mg/kg. As the dose is increased, it is usually possible to reduce and then 
stop the dose of insulin the patient is already receiving. </p>
<p>Higher doses of mglidiacan be given as needed and administered in up to four intakes per day based 
on blood-glucose monitoring, as per titration recommendations given by the referring doctor. </p>
<p>In case of minor vomiting, an antivomiting medicine will be prescribed by your doctor and Amglidia 
can be continued. 
As generally recommended in such situations, if vomiting occurs less than 30 minutes following 
administration of Amglidia, a new dose can be given. If vomiting occurs more than 30 minutes 
following administration of Amglidia, no new dose should be given. Always ask your child’s doctor 
for advice in such circumstances. </p>
<p>In case of major vomiting, ketonaemia and ketonuria should be closely monitored by the treating 
doctor. The doctor may start insulin therapy again, when ketonaemia or ketonuria were found to be 
responsible for the major vomiting. In case of inability of food or beverage intake, the child should go 
to emergency department to get an insulin and glucose perfusion until vomiting stops. </p>
<p>Method of administration </p>
<p>Always give the medicine 15 minutes before feeding. </p>
<p>The medicine should be given at the same times each day. </p>
<p>In case of milk feeding, recommendation is given to administer the suspension 15 minutes before 
child’s milk feeding. </p>
<p>This medicine is a ready-for-use oral suspension to be given with a marked oral syringe. Only the oral 
syringe included in the carton should be used. </p>
<p>The 1 mL syringe is thin and small and graduated in steps of 0.05 mL. The 5 mL syringe is thick and 
long and graduated in steps of 0.1 mL. </p>
<p>Instructions for use </p>
<p>The dose is measured by drawing the plunger of the syringe back until it reaches the marking for the 
dose the doctor has prescribed for your child. The dose in mL per administration and the number of 
administrations per day have to carefully follow the medical prescription. </p>
<p>While the child is awake, position the child in half-sitting position in the hollow of your arm, with the 
child’s head resting on your arm. </p>
<p>Slip about the first 1 cm of the syringe into the child’s mouth and place it against the inside cheek; Let 
the child suck. If the child does not suck, slowly press the plunger of the syringe so that the suspension 
trickles into the mouth. </p>
<p>Do not lay the child down directly after administration. It is recommended to wait for the child has 
swallowed the medicine before reverting back to lying position. </p>
<p>Make sure that you use correct strength of the medicine and the appropriate oral syringe prescribed by 
your doctor to avoid accidental administration of too high or too low amounts. </p>
