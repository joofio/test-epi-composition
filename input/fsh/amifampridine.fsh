<p>Amifampridine SERB is used to treat symptoms of a disease of the nerves and the muscles called 
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome or LEMS in adults. This disease is a disorder affecting the 
transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. It can be associated with 
certain tumour types (paraneoplastic form of LEMS) or in the absence of these tumours 
(non-paraneoplastic form of LEMS). </p>
<p>In patients suffering from this disease, a chemical substance called acetylcholine, which communicates 
nerve impulses to muscles is not released normally and the muscle doesn't receive some or all of the 
nerve's signals.  </p>
<p>Amifampridine SERB works by increasing the release of acetylcholine and helps the muscle to receive 
the nerve signals. </p>         </div>"""
