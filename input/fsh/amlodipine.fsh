  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan tablets contain two active substances called amlodipine and valsartan. 
Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure.  </p>
<p>Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called  calcium channel blockers . Amlodipine 
stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from 
tightening.  </p>
<p>Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called  angiotensin-II receptor antagonists . 
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the 
blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.<br />
This means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. As a result, the 
blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.  </p>
<p>Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not 
controlled enough with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own. </p>         </div>"""

itching, reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing.  </p>

<p>if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called  primary hyperaldosteronism .  </p>
<p>if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor s 
instructions for the starting dose carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function.  </p>
<p>if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called  aortic 
or mitral stenosis ) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
 obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ).  </p>
<p>if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other 
medicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, 
stop taking Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan and contact your doctor straight away. You should 
never take Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan again.  </p>
<p>if you have kidney problems where the blood supply to your kidneys is reduced (renal artery 
stenosis) </p>
<p>if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:  </p>
<p>an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, 
ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems.  </p>
<p>aliskiren.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals.  </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. In some cases 
you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed 
below:  </p>
<p>ACE inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan  and  Warnings and precautions );  </p>
<p>diuretics (a type of medicine also called  water tablets  which increases the amount of urine you 
produce);  </p>
<p>lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression);  </p>
<p>potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and 
other substances that may increase potassium levels;  </p>
<p>certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or 
selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors). Your doctor may also check your 
kidney function;  </p>
<p>anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone);  </p>
<p>St. John s wort;  </p>
<p>nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called  vasodilators ;  </p>
<p>medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir); </p>
<p>medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole);  </p>
<p>medicines used to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, 
talithromycin); </p>
<p>verapamil, diltiazem (heart medicines);  </p>
<p>simvastatin (a medicine used to control high cholesterol levels);  </p>
<p>dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities);  </p>
<p>medicines used to protect against transplant rejection (ciclosporin).  </p>
<p>Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan with food and drink 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in 
the blood levels of the active substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the 
blood pressure lowering effect of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Pregnancy<br />
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan before you become pregnant or as soon as you 
know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Amlodipine/Valsartan 
Mylan. Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is not recommended in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and 
must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if 
used after the third month of pregnancy.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.<br />
Amlodipine has been shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts. 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your 
doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is 
newborn, or was born prematurely.  </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine may make you feel dizzy. This can affect how well you can concentrate. So, if you are 
not sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you 
need to concentrate on. </p>         </div>"""
