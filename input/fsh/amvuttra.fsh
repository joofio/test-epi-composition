<p>What Amvuttra is used for </p>
<p>Amvuttra is used for the treatment of an illness called  hereditary ATTR  or  hATTR amyloidosis . 
This is an illness which runs in families. hATTR amyloidosis is caused by problems with a protein in 
the body called  transthyretin  (TTR). This protein is made mostly in the liver and carries vitamin A 
and other substances around the body. </p>
<p>In people with this illness, small fibres of TTR protein clump together to make deposits called 
 amyloid . Amyloid can build up around or within the nerves, heart, and other places in the body, 
stopping them from working normally. This causes the symptoms of the illness. </p>
<p>How Amvuttra works </p>
<p>Amvuttra works by lowering the amount of TTR protein made by the liver which means there is less 
TTR protein in the blood that can form amyloid. This can help to reduce the effects of this illness. </p>
<p>Amvuttra is used in adults only. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to vutrisiran, or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Lowered vitamin A levels in the blood and vitamin supplements </p>
<p>Amvuttra lowers the amount of vitamin A in your blood. 
Your doctor will ask you to take a daily vitamin A supplement. Please follow the vitamin A dose 
recommended by your doctor. 
Signs of low vitamin A may include: sight problems especially at night, dry eyes, hazy, or cloudy 
vision. 
* If you notice a change in your vision or any other eye problems whilst using Amvuttra, talk to 
your doctor. Your doctor may send you to an eye specialist for a check-up. </p>
<p>Both too high and too low levels of vitamin A can harm the development of your unborn child. 
Therefore, women of childbearing age should exclude any pregnancy before starting treatment with 
Amvuttra and practise effective contraception (see section  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
contraception  below). 
* Vitamin A levels may remain low for more than 12 months after the last dose of Amvuttra. <br />
* Tell your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will tell you to stop taking 
Amvuttra and vitamin A supplementation. Your doctor will also ensure that your vitamin A 
levels have returned to normal before conception is attempted. 
* Tell your doctor if you have an unplanned pregnancy. Your doctor will tell you to stop taking 
Amvuttra. In the first 3 months of your pregnancy, your doctor may tell you to stop taking 
vitamin A supplementation. During the last 6 months of your pregnancy, you doctor may tell 
you to resume the vitamin A supplementation if your vitamin A levels have not yet returned to 
normal, because of the increased risk of vitamin A deficiency during the last 3 months of your 
pregnancy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Amvuttra is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Amvuttra </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>You should not use Amvuttra if you are pregnant.  </p>
<p>Women of childbearing age </p>
<p>Amvuttra will reduce the level of vitamin A in your blood and vitamin A is important for normal 
development of your unborn child (see  Warnings and precautions  above). 
* You should use effective contraception during treatment with Amvuttra - if you are a woman 
who is able to become pregnant. 
* Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception. 
* Pregnancy should be excluded before starting treatment with Amvuttra. 
* Tell your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant or if you have an unplanned pregnancy. 
Your doctor will tell you to stop taking Amvuttra. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding  </p>
<p>It is not known if vutrisiran passes into breast milk. Your doctor will consider the potential benefits of 
treatment for you - compared with the risks of breast-feeding for your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Amvuttra is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. Your doctor will tell you whether 
your condition allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. </p>
<p>Amvuttra contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
