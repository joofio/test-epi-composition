with the development of platelets. It reduces the number of platelets produced by the bone marrow, 
which results in a decrease in the platelet count in the blood towards a more normal level. For this 
reason, it is used to treat patients with essential thrombocythaemia. </p>
<p>Essential thrombocythaemia is a condition which occurs when the bone marrow produces too many of 
the blood cells known as platelets. Large numbers of platelets in the blood can cause serious problems 
with blood circulation and clotting. </p>         </div>"""
