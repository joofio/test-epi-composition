<p>ANORO ELLIPTA contains two active substances umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol. These belong to a 
group of medicines called bronchodilators. </p>
<p>What ANORO ELLIPTA is used for  </p>
<p>ANORO ELLIPTA is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a 
long-term condition characterised by breathing difficulties that slowly get worse.  </p>
<p>In COPD the muscles around the airways tighten. This medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles in the 
lungs, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. When used regularly, it can help to control your 
breathing difficulties and reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.  </p>
<p>ANORO ELLIPTA should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing.<br />
If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). If you 
do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
