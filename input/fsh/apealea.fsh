<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Administration precautions 
Paclitaxel is an antineoplastic medicinal product and as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling Apealea. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is 
recommended. If the solution contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed 
thoroughly with water. Apealea should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately 
trained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant and breast-feeding staff should not handle 
Apealea. The reconstituted product should not be diluted. </p>
<p>Reconstitution of the medicinal product 
Apealea is supplied as a sterile powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, the solution 
contains 1 mg/mL of paclitaxel formulated as micellar nanoparticles. The reconstituted solution for 
infusion is a clear, greenish-yellow solution. </p>
<p>Protect from direct and/or bright light throughout the preparation process. The (reconstituted) product 
can only withstand short-term handling in absence of light protection. </p>
<p>Only reconstitute Apealea using one of the following commercially available solutions for 
reconstitution: 
- sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution suitable for infusion; 
- lactated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion; 
- acetated Ringer’s solution suitable for infusion. </p>
<p>The pH of lactated or acetated Ringer’s solution must be in the range of 5.0 to 7.5 and acceptable ion 
concentrations of calcium and magnesium are listed below (Table 1). </p>
