Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before the vaccination if you:</p>
<p>have any present or past medical problems after any dose of Apexxnar such as an allergic 
reaction or problems with breathing,</p>
<p>have a severe illness or high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for 
example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination,</p>
<p>have any bleeding problems or bruise easily,</p>
<p>have a weakened immune system (such as due to HIV infection); you may not get the full 
benefit from Apexxnar.
As with any vaccine, Apexxnar will not protect all persons who are vaccinated.
Other medicines/vaccines and Apexxnar
Apexxnar may be given at the same time as the flu (inactivated influenza) vaccine at different 
injection sites. Depending on the individual risk assessment of your health care provider, separation of 
both vaccinations of e.g., 4 weeks might be advised.
Apexxnar can be given at the same time as the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, or have recently received any other vaccine.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
Apexxnar has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of 
the effects mentioned under section 4  Possible side effects  may temporarily affect the ability to drive 
or use machines.
Apexxnar contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

Other sources of information
Detailed information on this product is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
During storage, a white deposit and clear supernatant may be observed. This does not constitute a sign 
of deterioration. Pre-filled syringes should be stored horizontally to minimise the resuspension time.
Preparation for administration
Step 1. Vaccine resuspension
Hold the pre-filled syringe horizontally between the thumb 
and the forefinger and shake vigorously until the contents of 
the syringe are a homogeneous white suspension. Do not use 
the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended.
Step 2. Visual inspection
Visually inspect the vaccine for large particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if large 
particulate matter or discolouration is found. If the vaccine is 
not a homogenous white suspension, repeat steps 1 and 2. Step 3. Remove syringe cap
Remove the syringe cap from the Luer lock adapter by 
slowly turning the cap counter clockwise while holding the 
Luer lock adapter. 
Note: Care should be taken to ensure that the extended 
plunger rod is not depressed while removing the syringe cap.
Step 4. Attach a sterile needle
Attach a needle appropriate for intramuscular administration to the pre-filled syringe by holding the 
Luer lock adapter and turning the needle clockwise.
Administer the entire dose.
Apexxnar is for intramuscular use only. 
Apexxnar must not be mixed with any other vaccines/medicinal products in the same syringe.
Apexxnar may be given to adults at the same time as the seasonal influenza vaccine (QIV; surface 
antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted). In individuals with underlying conditions associated with a high risk 
of developing life-threatening pneumococcal disease, consideration may be given to separating 
administrations of QIV and Apexxnar (e.g., by approximately 4 weeks). Different vaccination sites 
should be used.
Apexxnar can be given to adults at the same time as the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside 
modified).
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.</p>         </div>"""
