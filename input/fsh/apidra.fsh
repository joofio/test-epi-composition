<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see 
box at the end of this leaflet). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Apidra. 
Follow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood tests), diet and physical activity (physical 
work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. </p>
<p>Special patient groups 
If you have liver or kidney problems, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. </p>
<p>There is insufficient clinical information on the use of Apidra in children younger than the age of 
6 years. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Apidra). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. </p>
<p>Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc, 
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. </p>
<p>Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care: 
- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
- If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. </p>
<p>If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. </p>
<p>Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Apidra </p>
<p>Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. </p>
<p>Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), 
- sulphonamide antibiotics. </p>
<p>Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),<br />
- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
- somatropin (growth hormone), 
- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
- thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), 
- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), 
- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). </p>
<p>Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. </p>
<p>Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Apidra with alcohol </p>
<p>Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Careful control of your 
diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. </p>
<p>There are no or limited data on the use of Apidra in pregnant women. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels). </p>
<p>Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines).<br />
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Apidra </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>
<p>Apidra contains metacresol </p>

<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. </p>
<p>Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will determine how much Apidra you will need. </p>
<p>Apidra is a short-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with an 
intermediate, long-acting insulin, a basal insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. </p>
<p>If you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine, your dosage may have to be adjusted by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. </p>
<p>Method of administration </p>
<p>Apidra is injected under the skin (subcutaneously). It may also be given intravenously by healthcare 
professionals under close supervision by a doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Apidra. Apidra can be injected 
in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. The 
effect will be slightly quicker if the insulin is injected into your abdomen. As for all insulins, injection 
sites and infusion sites within an-injection area (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) must be rotated from 
one injection to the next. </p>
<p>Frequency of administration </p>
<p>Apidra should be taken shortly (0-15 minutes) before or soon after meals. </p>
<p>Instructions for proper use </p>
<p>How to handle the vials </p>
<p>Apidra vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale and for use with an 
insulin pump system. </p>
<p>Look at the vial before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and has no visible 
particles in it. 
Do not shake or mix it before use. </p>
<p>Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with Apidra, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you have to mix two types of insulin </p>
<p>Apidra must not be mixed with any preparation other than NPH human insulin. </p>
<p>If Apidra is mixed with NPH human insulin, Apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection 
should be given immediately after mixing. </p>
<p>How to handle an infusion pump system </p>
<p>Before using Apidra in the pump system you should have been given detailed instructions on how to 
use the pump system. In addition, you should have been provided with information about what to do if 
you become ill or if your blood sugar levels get too high or too low, or if the pump system fails.<br />
Use the pump system recommended by your doctor. Read and follow the instructions that come with 
your insulin infusion pump. Follow your doctor’s instructions about the basal infusion rate and the 
mealtime insulin boluses to be taken. Measure your blood sugar level regularly to make sure you get 
the benefit of the insulin infusion and to make sure that the pump is working properly. </p>
<p>Change the infusion set and reservoir at least every 48 hours using aseptic technique. These 
instructions may differ from the instructions that come with your insulin infusion pump. When you use 
Apidra in the pump system, it is important that you always follow these specific instructions. Failure 
to follow these specific instructions may lead to serious adverse events. </p>
<p>Apidra must never be mixed with diluents or any other insulin when used in a pump. </p>
<p>What to do if the pump system fails or when the pump is used incorrectly </p>
<p>Pump or infusion set problems or using the pump incorrectly can result in you not getting enough 
insulin. This can quickly cause you to have high blood sugar and diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of 
acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).<br />
If your blood sugar level starts to rise, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible. 
They will tell you what needs to be done. 
You may need to use Apidra with syringes or pens. You should always have an alternative insulin 
delivery system available for injection under the skin in case the pump system fails. </p>
<p>If you use more Apidra than you should </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have injected too much Apidra, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must 
eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see 
box at the end of this leaflet. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you forget to use Apidra </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have missed a dose of Apidra or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar 
level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on 
the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. </li>
<li>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you stop using Apidra </p>
<p>This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Apidra without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>Insulin Mix-ups </p>
<p>You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Apidra and 
other insulins. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Serious side effects </p>
<p>Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious. Hypoglycaemia is a very commonly 
reported side effect (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means 
that there is not enough sugar in the blood. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may 
become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If 
you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. 
See the box at the end of this leaflet for important further information about hypoglycaemia and its 
treatment. </p>
<p>If you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately: 
Systemic allergic reactions are side effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Generalised allergy to insulin: Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash 
and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angioedema), shortness 
of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. These could be symptoms of 
severe cases of generalised allergy to insulin, including anaphylactic reaction, which may be 
life-threatening. </p>
<p>Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) means that there is too much sugar in the blood. The 
frequency of hyperglycaemia cannot be estimated. If your blood sugar level is too high, this tells you 
that you may need more insulin than you have injected.<br />
Hyperglycaemia can cause diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body 
is breaking down fat instead of sugar). 
These are serious side effects. 
These conditions can happen when there are problems with the infusion pump or when the 
pump system is used incorrectly. 
This means you may not always get enough insulin to treat your diabetes. 
If this happens you must seek urgent medical help. 
Always have available an alternative insulin delivery system for injection under the skin (see 
section 3 under “How to handle an infusion pump system” and “What to do if the pump system fails or 
when the pump is used incorrectly”). 
For more information on signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia refer to the box at the end of this 
leaflet. </p>
<p>Other side effects 
• Skin changes at the injection site:<br />
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or 
thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). Lumps under the skin may also be 
caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not 
known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site 
with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. </p>
<p>Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
Reactions at the injection site may occur (such as reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, 
itching, hives, swelling or inflammation). They can also spread around the injection site. Most minor 
reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. </p>
<p>Side effects where the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data 
* Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
