anticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which 
is an important component of blood clotting. </p>
<p>Apixaban Accord is used in adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to prevent blood clots (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) from forming after hip or knee replacement 
operations. After an operation to the hip or knee you may be at a higher risk of developing blood 
clots in your leg veins. This can cause the legs to swell, with or without pain. If a blood clot travels 
from your leg to your lungs, it can block blood flow causing breathlessness, with or without chest 
pain. This condition (pulmonary embolism) can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical 
attention. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial 
fibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the brain 
and lead to a stroke or travelto other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also 
known as a systemic embolism). A stroke can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical 
attention. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of your 
lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood vessels of 
your legs and/or lungs. </p>
