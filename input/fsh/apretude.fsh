are at an increased risk of infection. This is called pre-exposure prophylaxis: PrEP (see section 2).                            <br />

 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cabotegravir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
 If you are HIV positive or you do not know if you are HIV positive. Apretude can only help reduce 
your risk of getting HIV before you are infected. You must get tested to make sure you are HIV 
negative before taking Apretude. 
 if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
<em>carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent fits). 
</em>rifampicin or rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). </p>
<p>These medicines reduce the effectiveness of Apretude by decreasing the amount of Apretude in the 
blood. 
  If you think these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Just taking Apretude may not prevent HIV infection.  </p>
<p>HIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who is HIV positive or by transfer of infected 
blood. Although Apretude lowers the risk of becoming infected, you can still get HIV when taking this 
medicine.<br />
Other measures should be taken to further reduce your risk of getting HIV:<br />
<em> Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections when your doctor tells you to. These 
infections make it easier for HIV to infect you.<br />
</em> Use a condom when you have oral or penetrative sex.<br />
<em> Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment.<br />
</em> Do not share personal items that may have blood or body fluids on them (such as razor blades or 
toothbrushes).<br />
Discuss with your doctor the additional precautions needed to further decrease the risk of getting HIV.  </p>
<p>Reduce the risk of getting HIV: 
There is a risk of resistance to this medicine if you get infected with HIV. This means that the 
medicine will not prevent HIV infection. To minimise this risk and to prevent infection with HIV, it is 
important that you:<br />
• attend your planned appointments to receive your Apretude injection. Talk to your doctor if you 
are thinking about stopping injections, as this may increase your risk of getting a HIV infection. If 
you do stop, or are late receiving your Apretude injection, you will need to take other medicines or 
precautions to reduce your risk of getting HIV and possibly developing viral resistance. <br />
•    get tested for HIV when your doctor tells you.  You must be regularly tested to make sure that you 
remain HIV-1 negative while taking Apretude. 
•    tell your doctor straight away if you think you have been infected with HIV (you may get a flu-
like illness). They may want to do more tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. 
Apretude injection is a long-acting medicine 
If you stop Apretude injections, cabotegravir will remain in your system for up to a year or more after 
your last injection, but this will not be enough to protect you from becoming infected.<br />
It is important that you attend your planned appointments to receive Apretude injection. Talk to your 
doctor if you are thinking about stopping PrEP.<br />
Once you stop Apretude injections you may need to take other medicines to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV infection or use other safe sex precautions.<br />
Liver problems 
Let your doctor know if you have liver problems. You may need to be more closely monitored. (See 
also ‘Uncommon side effects’ in section 4). 
Adolescents<br />
Your doctor will discuss your mental health with you before and while receiving Apretude. Let your 
doctor know if you have mental health problems. You may need to be more closely monitored (See 
also section 4). </p>
<p>Allergic reaction<br />
Apretude contains cabotegravir, which is an integrase inhibitor. Integrase inhibitors, including 
cabotegravir, can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. You need to 
know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re receiving Apretude.  </p>
<p> Read the information in ‘Possible side effects’ in section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents weighing less than 35 kg, because it has 
not been studied in these individuals. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Apretude<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
other medicines bought without a prescription. </p>
<p>Some medicines can affect how Apretude works or make it more likely that you will have side effects. 
Apretude can also affect how some other medicines work. </p>
<p>Apretude must not be given with some other medicines that may affect how well the medicine works<br />
. (see ‘Do not use Apretude’ in section 2). These include: 
<em>carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent fits). 
</em>rifampicin or rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking: 
 rifabutin (to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). You may need to receive 
Apretude injections more often. </p>
<p> Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking this medicine. Your doctor may decide that you 
need extra check-ups. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before receiving this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Apretude is not recommended during pregnancy. The effect of Apretude on pregnancy is unknown. 
Talk to your doctor: if you could get pregnant, if you are planning to have a baby or if you become 
pregnant. Do not stop attending your appointments to receive Apretude without consulting your 
doctor. Your doctor will consider the benefit to you and the risk to your baby of starting/continuing 
Apretude. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether the ingredients of Apretude can pass into breast milk. However, cabotegravir, 
may pass into breast milk for up to 12 months after the last injection of Apretude. If you are breast-
feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, check with your doctor. Your doctor will consider the 
benefit and risks of breast-feeding for you and your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>Apretude can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert.<br />
 Don’t drive or use machines unless you are sure you’re not affected. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Before starting treatment with Apretude injections, you and your doctor may decide first take 
cabotegravir tablets (called oral lead-in period). The lead-in period allows you and your doctor to 
assess whether it’s appropriate to proceed with injections. 
If you decide to start treatment with tablets: 
<em>You should take one 30 mg Apretude tablet once a day, for approximately one month.

Apretude.  </p>

an Apretude injection again. </p>
<p>Don’t stop receiving Apretude injections without advice from your doctor. 
Keep receiving Apretude injections for as long as your doctor recommends. Don’t stop unless your 
doctor advises you to. If you stop and you are still at risk of getting HIV your doctor must start you on 
another PrEP medicine within 2 months of your last Apretude injection. </p>
