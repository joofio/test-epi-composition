  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Aqumeldi contains the active substance enalapril maleate. 
It is used in children and adolescents from birth to 17 years to treat heart failure (the inability of the 
heart to pump enough blood around the body). 
Enalapril maleate belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACE inhibitors), which means that it blocks an enzyme (protein) in the body from forming the 
hormone angiotensin II. By narrowing blood vessels, angiotensin II can cause high blood pressure 
which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood around the body. Angiotensin II also releases 
hormones, such as aldosterone, that raise blood pressure by causing fluid retention.
By blocking the formation of angiotensin II, Aqumeldi modifies the hormone system which influences 
blood pressure and fluid balance within the body. This helps to lower blood pressure and increases the 
supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. The medicine usually starts to work within an hour, but 
several weeks of treatment may be required before the condition improves.</p>         </div>"""

<p>is allergic to enalapril maleate, any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
or other ACE inhibitors (such as captopril, lisinopril or ramipril). ACE inhibitors are used to 
treat high blood pressure or heart failure).</p>
<p>has ever had a reaction called angioedema (rapid swelling under the skin in areas such as the 
face, throat, arms and legs, which can be life threatening if throat swelling blocks the airway) 
when taking another ACE inhibitor or when the cause for angioedema was not-known or it was 
inherited.</p>
<p>is more than 3 months pregnant. It is also better to avoid Aqumeldi in early pregnancy   (see 
section 2  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility ).</p>
<p>has diabetes or reduced kidney function and is treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine 
containing aliskiren (see section 2  Other medicines and Aqumeldi ).</p>
<p>has taken or is currently taking sacubitril / valsartan, a medicine used to treat a type of long-term 
(chronic) heart failure, as the risk of angioedema is increased. Wait at least 36 hours after last 
dose of sacubitril / valsartan before taking Aqumeldi.</p>
<p>has severe kidney disease.
If you are not sure, talk to your or your child s doctor or pharmacist before giving Aqumeldi.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to the doctor before giving Aqumeldi if you or your child:</p>
<p>has a heart problem called left ventricular valvular obstruction or outflow tract obstruction or 
cardiogenic shock. </p>
<p>has a condition involving the blood vessels in the brain (e.g., stenosis, thrombosis, embolism, 
haemorrhage).</p>
<p>has collagen vascular disease (conditions that cause long-lasting inflammation in connective 
tissues which are tissues that hold your bones, muscles and ligaments together). </p>
<p>is taking immunosuppressant therapy (used to lower the body s immune response), treatment 
with allopurinol (used to lower uric acid levels) or procainamide (used to treat rhythm 
disturbances of the heart). In these instances, enalapril can increase the risk of low levels of 
neutrophils (neutropenia) a type of white blood cell that fights infection, very low levels of a 
type of white blood cell called granulocytes (agranulocytosis) which are important for fighting 
off infection, low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) which can lead to bleeding and 
bruising and low levels of red blood cells (anaemia) which can cause tiredness and pale skin 
(see section 2  Other medicines and Aqumeldi ).</p>
<p>has ever had an allergic reaction to ACE inhibitors, with swelling of the face, lips, tongue or 
throat with difficulty in swallowing or breathing (angioedema).  Angioedema can occur at any 
point during treatment with Aqumeldi. If symptoms appear Aqumeldi should be stopped and 
immediate treatment sought. You should be aware that black patients are at increased risk of 
these types of reactions to ACE inhibitors (medicines that work like Aqumeldi).  The risk of 
angioedema may be increased in patients taking other medicines (see section 2  Other 
medicines and Aqumeldi ).</p>
<p>has a kidney problem (including kidney transplantation) diabetes, dehydration, sudden 
worsening of heart failure, a build up of acid in the body or use of diuretics (water tablets) 
which maintain the amount of potassium in the blood (such as spironolactone, eplerenone, 
triamterene, or amiloride) or substitutes that contain potassium or medicines known to increase 
potassium in the blood  (such as, heparin, trimethoprim or cotrimoxazole). These situations may 
lead to high blood potassium levels (hyperkalaemia) which can cause tiredness, muscle 
weakness, feeling sick and heart rhythm disturbances. Your or your child s doctor may need to 
adjust the dose of Aqumeldi or regularly check the amount of potassium in the blood (see 
section 2  Other medicines and Aqumeldi ). </p>
<p>has a problem with the arteries of the kidney, as this can increase the risk of low blood pressure 
or the kidneys not working properly.</p>
<p>has been very sick (excessive vomiting) or had bad diarrhoea recently.</p>
<p>has diabetes. The blood should be checked for low blood glucose levels, especially during the 
first month of treatment. The amount of potassium in the blood can also be higher.</p>
<p>is having dialysis, since the dose of Aqumeldi may need changing.</p>
<p>has low blood pressure (may be noticed as faintness or dizziness, especially when standing).</p>
<p>is taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: an angiotensin II 
receptor blocker (ARBs) (also known as sartans - for example valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan) 
as these can increase the risk of low blood pressure, high potassium in the blood and kidney 
problems (see section 2  Other medicines and Aqumeldi ).</p>
<p>is under 1 month of age and has a liver problem or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and white of 
the eye).</p>
<p>is under 1 month of age as very young children are more at risk of problems with low blood 
pressure, kidney problems and high potassium in the blood.
Your doctor may check your or your child s kidney function, blood pressure, and the level of 
electrolytes (e.g., potassium) in the blood regularly.
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you or your child, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
before giving Aqumeldi.
If you or your child is about to have a medical procedure
Tell the doctor that you or your child are using Aqumeldi if you or your child are about to receive any 
of the following procedures: </p>
<p>any surgery or medicine to numb sensation (anaesthetic) (even at the dentist). </p>
<p>desensitisation as a treatment for allergy, for example with bee or wasp venom (hymenoptera 
venom).</p>
<p>treatment to remove cholesterol from the blood called LDL-apheresis.
If any of the above applies talk to your or your child s doctor or dentist before the procedure.
Other medicines and Aqumeldi
Please tell the doctor or pharmacist if you or your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any 
other medicines including medicines obtained without a prescription. This includes herbal medicines. 
Your doctor may need to change your or your child s dose and/or to take other precautions. 
Taking Aqumeldi with the following medicines can affect the way Aqumeldi or the listed medicines 
work or can increase the risk of side effects:</p>
<p>antihypertensives, medicines to lower blood pressure (different types are listed below):<em> angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), sometimes called sartans, (e.g. losartan, 
valsartan);</em> aliskiren;<em> beta blockers (e.g. atenolol, propranolol);</em> diuretics (a medicine that increases urine production) (e.g. furosemide, chlorothiazide);<em> vasodilators (medicine to open (dilate) blood vessels) (e.g. nitroglycerin, isosorbide 
mononitrate);</em> neprilysin inhibitors (e.g. sacubitril, racecadotril). 
The risk of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat with difficulty in swallowing 
or breathing) may be increased when using these medicines (see in section 2  Do not give 
Aqumeldi if you or your child ).</p>
<p>potassium preserving medicines, medicines to increase potassium in the blood can cause the 
potassium to be too high) (different types are listed below):<em> potassium supplements and salt substitutes; * potassium-sparing diuretics (a medicine that increases urine production) (e.g. 
spironolactone, amiloride);</em> antibiotics, used to treat bacterial infections (e.g. trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole);* heparin used to thin blood and prevent clots.</p>
<p>lithium, medicine to treat depression.</p>
<p>tricyclic antidepressants used for treating depression (e.g. amitriptyline).</p>
<p>antipsychotics, medicine to treat mental health problems.</p>
<p>cough and cold medicines and weight reducing medicines (e.g. pseudoephedrine, 
amphetamine).</p>
<p>gold, used to treat pain or arthritis.</p>
<p>antidiabetic medicines including insulin and vildagliptin, used to lower blood sugar.</p>
<p>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), medicines to reduce inflammation and 
relieve pain (different types are listed below):<em> selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors, for example, ibuprofen);</em> acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin).</p>
<p>transplant rejection medicines, used to prevent organ transplant rejection (e.g. ciclosporin, 
temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus).
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you or your child, talk to the doctor or pharmacist 
before giving Aqumeldi.
Aqumeldi with food, drink and alcohol
You or your child should not drink alcohol while taking Aqumeldi. Alcohol may cause blood pressure 
to drop too much and you or your child may experience dizziness, light-headedness or faintness.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
You must tell your doctor if you think you or your child are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor 
will normally advise to stop taking Aqumeldi before becoming pregnant or as soon as knowing about 
the pregnancy and will advise to take another medicine instead of Aqumeldi.
Aqumeldi is not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken when more than 3 months 
pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to the baby if used after the third month of pregnancy (see 
section 2  Do not give Aqumeldi if you or your child ).
If you are a female of childbearing potential, you must use effective contraception during and up to 
1 week after treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding and discuss whether to stop 
breast-feeding or stop taking Aqumeldi treatment. 
Driving and using machines
Aqumeldi may make you or your child sleepy or affect concentration and co-ordination. This may 
affect performance at skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines. 
Aqumeldi contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .</p>         </div>"""

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
Please read carefully before using the orodispersible tablet(s).
Aqumeldi should only be taken by mouth. It is an orodispersible tablet, which means it dissolves in the 
mouth or in water. The tablet can be taken with or without meals.
1. Due to the small size of the tablets, use the scoop provided in the pack to collect the required 
number of orodispersible tablets from the bottle. As much as possible, avoid touching the tablets 
with your hands.
2. Place the orodispersible tablet(s) on the tongue, or into the space between the gum and the 
cheek (buccal cavity) and allow to disperse. 
3. Do not crush the orodispersible tablets. 
If the dose prescribed by the doctor is less than 0.25 mg, it can be achieved as follows:
1. Place one 0.25 mg orodispersible tablet to be dispersed in a 10 ml oral syringe.
2. Draw up 10 ml of fresh tap water into the syringe (up to the 10 ml graduation mark). Sterile 
water should be used in children under 6 months of age.
3. Carefully roll the syringe for 3 minutes until the orodispersible tablet is fully dispersed.
4. This results in a concentration of 0.025 mg/ml enalapril maleate.
5. 1 ml of the resulting solution will contain 0.025 mg enalapril, 4 ml will contain 0.1 mg 
enalapril.
6. The required volume of dispersion should then be administered immediately to the patient; do 
not store the dispersion in the oral syringe.
If you or your child is given the medicine through a feeding tube, the following procedure should be 
followed:
1. Remove the plunger from the syringe you use with the feeding tube (syringe not provided) and 
place the required number of orodispersible tablets in the barrel of the syringe. 
Note: a maximum of four orodispersible tablets can be dispersed in 1 ml at any one time, the 
following procedure may need to be repeated to achieve the recommended dose.
2. Replace the plunger and draw up 1 ml of fresh tap water. Sterile water should be used in 
children under 6 months of age.
3. Cap the syringe and carefully roll or mix for 3 minutes for the orodispersible tablets to disperse.
4. Remove the cap and give the dose via the feeding tube.
5. Flush the feeding tube with at least 3 ml of water after giving the medicine.
The solution should be given immediately to you or your child. Do not store.
Standard feeding tubes (polyurethane, polyvinylchloride and silicone) have been found to be suitable 
to use with this medicine.
If you or your child takes more Aqumeldi than they should
Do not give more medicine than your or your child s doctor tells you to. If you or your child has 
swallowed more tablets than the doctor has prescribed, contact your nearest hospital casualty 
department or doctor immediately. Take the medicine pack with you.
The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are fall in blood pressure (signs may include 
dizziness or light-headedness) and a state of almost complete lack of consciousness (stupor). Other 
symptoms may include forceful and rapid heartbeat, rapid pulse, anxiety, cough, kidney failure and 
rapid breathing. 
If you or your child forgets to take Aqumeldi
If you or your child forgets to take Aqumeldi, skip the missed dose.
Take the next dose as usual.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you or your child stops taking Aqumeldi
Do not stop giving Aqumeldi unless your or your child s doctor tells you to.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your or your child s doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
