  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Your doctor has given you Aranesp (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. Anaemia is when your 
blood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and 
shortness of breath.  </p>
<p>Aranesp works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is 
produced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The 
active substance of Aranesp is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster 
Ovary Cells (CHO-K1).  </p>
<p>If you have chronic renal failure  </p>
<p>Aranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney 
failure) in adults and children. In kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural 
hormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia.  </p>
<p>Because it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks 
before you notice any effect. Your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of Aranesp to treat 
your anaemia. </p>
<p>If you are receiving chemotherapy </p>
<p>Aranesp is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers 
(non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. </p>
<p>One of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood 
cells. Towards the end of your chemotherapy course, particularly if you have had a lot of 
chemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to darbepoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in 
section 6. - if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other 
medicines prescribed by your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aranesp. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; </li>
<li>sickle cell anaemia; </li>
<li>epileptic fits (seizures);  </li>
<li>convulsions (fits or seizures);  </li>
<li>liver disease; </li>
<li>significant lack of response to medicines used to treat anaemia; </li>
<li>an allergy to latex (the needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex); or </li>
<li>hepatitis C. </li>
</ul>
<p>Special warnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean 
you have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients. PRCA means that 
the body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. 
If you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best 
course of action to treat your anaemia.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: Aranesp is one of 
a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein 
erythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you 
are using. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to 
Aranesp, your doctor will check your dose of Aranesp because repeatedly increasing your dose 
of Aranesp if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of 
the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dL. Your doctor will 
check that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high haemoglobin 
concentrations could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and 
could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have symptoms which include severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, problems with 
your eyesight, nausea, vomiting or fits (seizures), it could mean that you have very high blood 
pressure. If you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Aranesp may act as a blood cell growth 
factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. Depending on 
your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss this with your 
doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. SJS/TEN can appear 
initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. 
Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These 
serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may 
progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications.<br />
If you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking Aranesp and 
contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Aranesp </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Cyclosporin and tacrolimus (medicines which suppress the immune system) may be affected by the 
number of red cells in your blood. It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking either of these 
medicines. </p>
<p>Using Aranesp with food and drink </p>
<p>Food and drink do not affect Aranesp. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Aranesp has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: 
* are pregnant;<br />
* think you may be pregnant; or 
* plan to get pregnant.  </p>
<p>It is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if 
you use Aranesp. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Aranesp should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. </p>
<p>Aranesp contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Following blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Aranesp as your haemoglobin level is 
10 g/dL or less. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Aranesp in order to 
maintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL. This may vary depending on whether you are 
an adult or a child.  </p>
<p>Injecting Aranesp yourself </p>
<p>Your doctor may decide that it is best for you or a carer to inject Aranesp. Your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the pre-filled syringe. Do not try to inject 
yourself if you have not been trained. Never inject Aranesp into a vein yourself.  </p>
<p>If you have chronic renal failure </p>
<p>For all adult and paediatric patients   1 year of age with chronic renal failure, Aranesp is given as a 
single injection, either under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). </p>
<p>In order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight will 
be either: 
* 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or 
* 0.45 micrograms once weekly. 
For adult patients not on dialysis, 1.5 micrograms/kg once monthly may also be used as the initial 
dose. </p>
<p>For all adult and paediatric patients   1 year of age with chronic renal failure, once your anaemia is 
corrected you will continue to receive Aranesp given as a single injection, either once a week or once 
every two weeks. For all adults and paediatric patients   11 years of age not on dialysis, Aranesp 
could also be given as an injection once monthly. </p>
<p>Your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may 
adjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary in order to maintain long term control of your 
anaemia. </p>
<p>Your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. </p>
<p>If you do not respond adequately to Aranesp, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you if 
you need to change doses of Aranesp. </p>
<p>Your blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. </p>
<p>In some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. </p>
<p>Your doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a 
vein). If this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will 
take blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. </p>
<p>If your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-HuEPO (erythropoietin produced by 
gene-technology) to Aranesp, they will choose whether you should receive your Aranesp injection 
once weekly or once every two weeks. The route of injection is the same as with r-HuEPO but your 
doctor will tell you how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. </p>
<p>If you are receiving chemotherapy </p>
<p>Aranesp is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin.  </p>
<p>In order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be: 
* 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of Aranesp per kilogram of your 
body weight); or 
* 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of Aranesp per kilogram of your body weight. </p>
<p>Your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may 
adjust your dose as necessary. Your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the 
end of your chemotherapy. Your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking Aranesp. </p>
<p>In some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. </p>
<p>If you use more Aranesp than you should </p>
<p>You could have serious problems if you use more Aranesp than you need, such as very high blood 
pressure. You should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. If you feel unwell 
in any way you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Aranesp </p>
<p>Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  </p>
<p>If you have forgotten a dose of Aranesp, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should 
inject the next dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Aranesp </p>
<p>If you want to stop using Aranesp, you should discuss it with your doctor first. </p>         </div>"""

<li>Instructions for injecting with the Aranesp pre-filled syringe  </li>
</ol>
<p>This section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Aranesp. It is important that 
you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist 
for assistance. </p>
<p>How do you or the person injecting you, use the Aranesp pre-filled syringe? </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed an Aranesp pre-filled syringe for injection into the tissue just under the 
skin. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will tell you how much Aranesp you need and how frequently 
it should be injected.  </p>
<p>Equipment: </p>
<p>To give yourself an injection you will need: </p>
<ul>
<li>a new Aranesp pre-filled syringe; and </li>
<li>alcohol wipes or similar. </li>
</ul>
<p>What should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Aranesp? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator. Leave the pre-filled syringe at room 
temperature for approximately 30 minutes. This will make the injection more comfortable. Do 
not warm Aranesp in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot 
water). Additionally, do not leave the syringe exposed to direct sunlight. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not remove the cap from the syringe until you are ready to inject. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that it is the correct dose that your doctor has prescribed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed 
the last day of the month shown. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the appearance of Aranesp. It must be a clear, colourless or slightly pearly liquid. If it is 
cloudy or there are particles in it, you must not use it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I prepare my Aranesp injection? </p>
<p>Before you inject Aranesp you must do the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>To avoid bending the needle, gently pull the cap from the needle 
without twisting as shown in pictures 1 and </li>
</ol>         </div>"""
