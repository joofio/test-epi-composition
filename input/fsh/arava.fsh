  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Arava 
- if you have ever had an allergic reaction to leflunomide (especially a serious skin reaction, often 
accompanied by fever, joint pain, red skin stains, or blisters e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome) or 
to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6), or if you are allergic to 
teriflunomide (used to treat multiple sclerosis), 
- if you have any liver problems, 
- if you have moderate to severe kidney problems, 
- if you have severely low numbers of proteins in your blood (hypoproteinaemia),<br />
- if you suffer from any problem which affects your immune system (e.g. AIDS),<br />
- if you have any problem with your bone marrow, or if you have low numbers of red or white 
cells in your blood or a reduced number of blood platelets,<br />
- if you are suffering from a serious infection, 
- if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Arava 
- if you have ever suffered from inflammation of the lung (interstitial lung disease). 
- if you have ever had tuberculosis or if you have been in close contact with someone who has or 
has had tuberculosis. Your doctor may perform tests to see if you have tuberculosis. 
- if you are male and wish to father a child. As it can not be excluded that Arava passes into 
semen, reliable contraception should be used during treatment with Arava. Men wishing to 
father a child should contact their doctor who may advise them to stop taking Arava and take 
certain medicines to remove Arava rapidly and sufficiently from their body. You will then need 
a blood test to make sure that Arava has been sufficiently removed from your body, and you 
should then wait for at least another 3 months before attempting to father a child. 
-<br />
if you are due to have a specific blood test (calcium level). Falsely low levels of calcium can be 
detected. </p>
<p>Arava can occasionally cause some problems with your blood, liver, lungs, or nerves in your arms or 
legs. It may also cause some serious allergic reactions (including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms [DRESS]), or increase the chance of a severe infection. For more information on 
these, please read section 4 (Possible side effects). </p>
<p>DRESS appears initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high 
temperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type of white 
blood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out blood tests at regular intervals, before and during treatment with Arava, to 
monitor your blood cells and liver. Your doctor will also check your blood pressure regularly as Arava 
can cause an increase in blood pressure. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have unexplained chronic diarrhoea. Your doctor may perform additional tests 
for differential diagnosis. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you develop skin ulcer during treatment with Arava (see also section 4). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Arava is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Arava 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>This is especially important if you are taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis such as antimalarials (e.g. chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine), intramuscular or oral gold, D-penicillamine, azathioprine and other 
immunosuppressive medicines (e.g. methotrexate) as these combinations are not advisable, </li>
<li>warfarin and other oral medicines used to thin the blood, as monitoring is necessary to reduce 
the risk of side effects of this medicine </li>
<li>teriflunomide for multiple sclerosis </li>
<li>repaglinide, pioglitazone, nateglinide, or rosiglitazone for diabetes  </li>
<li>daunorubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or topotecan for cancer  </li>
<li>duloxetine for depression, urinary incontinence or in kidney disease in diabetics  </li>
<li>alosetron for the management of severe diarrhoea </li>
<li>theophylline for asthma </li>
<li>tizanidine, a muscle relaxant  </li>
<li>oral contraceptives (containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) </li>
<li>cefaclor, benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), ciprofloxacin for infections  </li>
<li>indomethacin, ketoprofen for pain or inflammation  </li>
<li>furosemide for heart disease (diuretic, water pill) </li>
<li>zidovudine for HIV infection  </li>
<li>rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol)  </li>
<li>sulfasalazine for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis </li>
<li>a medicine called colestyramine (used to reduce high cholesterol) or activated charcoal as these 
medicines can reduce the amount of Arava which is absorbed by the body. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are already taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and/or corticosteroids, 
you may continue to take them after starting Arava. </p>
<p>Vaccinations 
If you have to be vaccinated, ask your doctor for advice. Certain vaccinations should not be given 
while taking Arava, and for a certain amount of time after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Arava with food, drink and alcohol 
Arava may be taken with or without food. 
It is not recommended to drink alcohol during treatment with Arava. Drinking alcohol while taking 
Arava may increase the chance of liver damage. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Arava if you are, or think you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant or become pregnant 
while taking Arava, the risk of having a baby with serious birth defects is increased. Women of 
childbearing potential must not take Arava without using reliable contraceptive measures. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with Arava, as you need to 
ensure that all traces of Arava have left your body before trying to become pregnant. This may take up 
to 2 years. This may be reduced to a few weeks by taking certain medicines which speed up removal 
of Arava from your body.<br />
In either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that Arava has been sufficiently removed from 
your body and you should then wait for at least another month before you become pregnant. </p>
<p>For further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you suspect that you are pregnant while taking Arava or in the two years after you have stopped 
treatment, you must contact your doctor immediately for a pregnancy test. If the test confirms that 
you are pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with certain medicines to remove Arava rapidly 
and sufficiently from your body, as this may decrease the risk to your baby. </p>
<p>Do not take Arava when you are breast-feeding, as leflunomide passes into the breast milk.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Arava can make you feel dizzy which may impair your ability to concentrate and react. If you are 
affected, do not drive, or use machines. </p>
<p>Arava contains lactose<br />
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
