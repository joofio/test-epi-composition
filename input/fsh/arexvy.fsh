 respiratory syncytial virus  (RSV).<br />
RSV is a respiratory virus that spreads very easily. </p>
<p>RSV can cause lower respiratory tract disease - infections of the lungs and other parts of the 
body that help you breathe.<br />
RSV infection can happen at any age, and usually causes mild, cold-like signs in adults. But it can 
also: </p>
<p>cause more serious respiratory illness in infants and older adults </p>
<p>make some illnesses worse, such as long-term respiratory or heart diseases. 
How Arexvy works 
Arexvy helps your body s natural defences make antibodies and special white blood cells. These 
protect you against RSV.<br />
Arexvy does not contain the virus. This means it cannot cause an infection. </p>         </div>"""
