<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Aripiprazole Zentiva. 
Suicidal thoughts and behaviours have been reported during aripiprazole treatment. Tell your doctor 
immediately if you are having any thoughts or feelings about hurting yourself. 
Before treatment with Aripiprazole Zentiva, tell your doctor if you suffer from 
* high blood sugar (characterised by symptoms such as excessive thirst, passing of large amounts 
of urine, increase in appetite and feeling weak) or family history of diabetes 
* fits (seizures) since your doctor may want to monitor you more closely 
* involuntary, irregular muscle movements, especially in the face 
* cardiovascular diseases (diseases of the heart and circulation), family history of cardiovascular 
disease, stroke or  mini  stroke, abnormal blood pressure 
* blood clots, or family history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been associated with 
formation of blood clots 
* past experience with excessive gambling. </p>
<p>If you notice you are gaining weight, develop unusual movements, experience somnolence that 
interferes with normal daily activities, any difficulty in swallowing or allergic symptoms, please tell 
your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are an elderly patient suffering from dementia (loss of memory and other mental abilities), 
you or your carer/relative should tell your doctor if you have ever had a stroke or  mini  stroke. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you are having any thoughts or feelings about hurting yourself. 
Suicidal thoughts and behaviours have been reported during aripiprazole treatment. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you suffer from muscle stiffness or inflexibility with high fever, 
sweating, altered mental status, or very rapid or irregular heart beat. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings 
to behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation 
to carry out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control 
disorders and can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, 
an abnormally high sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. 
Your doctor may need to adjust or stop your dose. </p>
<p>Aripiprazole may cause sleepiness, fall in blood pressure when standing up, dizziness and changes in 
your ability to move and balance, which may lead to falls. Caution should be taken, particularly if you 
are an elderly patient or have some debility. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not use this medicine in children and adolescents under 13 years of age. It is not known if it is safe 
and effective in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Aripiprazole Zentiva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Blood pressure-lowering medicines: Aripiprazole Zentiva may increase the effect of medicines used to 
lower the blood pressure. Be sure to tell your doctor if you take a medicine to keep your blood 
pressure under control. </p>
<p>Taking Aripiprazole Zentiva with some medicines may mean the doctor will need to change your dose 
of Aripiprazole Zentiva or the other medicines. It is especially important to mention the following 
to your doctor: 
* medicines to correct heart rhythm (such as quinidine, amiodarone, flecainide)

paroxetine, venlafaxine, St. John s Wort) 
* antifungal medicines (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole) 
* certain medicines to treat HIV infection (such as efavirenz, nevirapine, an protease inhibitors 
e.g. indinavir, ritonavir) 
* anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) 
* certain antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis (rifabutin, rifampicin). </p>
<p>These medicines may increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effect of Aripiprazole Zentiva; 
if you get any unusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with Aripiprazole Zentiva, you 
should see your doctor. </p>
<p>Medicines that increase the level of serotonin are typically used in conditions including depression, 
generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia as well 
as migraine and pain: 
* triptans, tramadol and tryptophan used for conditions including depression, generalised anxiety 
disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia as well as migraine and pain 
* selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors (SSRIs) (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine) used for 
depression, OCD, panic and anxiety 
* other anti-depressants (such as venlafaxine and tryptophan) used in major depression 
* tricyclic s (such as clomipramine and amitriptyline) used for depressive illness 
* St John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) used as a herbal remedy for mild depression 
* pain killers (such as tramadol and pethidine) used for pain relief 
* triptans (such as sumatriptan and zolmitripitan) used for treating migraine </p>
<p>These medicines may increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking any 
of these medicines together with Aripiprazole Zentiva, you should see your doctor. </p>

This medicine can be taken regardless of meals.

Zentiva in the last trimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or 
weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops 
any of these symptoms you may need to contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are taking Aripiprazole Zentiva, your doctor will discuss with you whether you should breast 
feed considering the benefit to you of your therapy and the benefit to your baby of breast feeding. 
You should not do both. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you are taking this 
medicine. </p>

Dizziness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see section 4). This 
should be considered in cases where full alertness is required, e.g. when driving a car or handling
