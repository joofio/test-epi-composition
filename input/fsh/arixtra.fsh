<p>Arixtra contains a synthetic substance called fondaparinux sodium.  This stops a clotting factor Xa 
( ten-A ) from working in the blood, and so prevents unwanted blood clots (thromboses) from 
forming in the blood vessels.  </p>
<p>Arixtra is used to:<br />
* prevent the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels of the legs or lungs after orthopaedic 
surgery (such as hip or knee surgery) or abdominal surgery 
* prevent the formation of blood clots during and shortly after a period of restricted mobility due 
to acute illness. 
* treat blood clots in blood vessels that are near the surface of  the skin of the legs  (superficial-
vein thrombosis).   </p>         </div>"""

You should continue Arixtra treatment for as long as your doctor has told you, since Arixtra prevents 
development of a serious condition. </p>

bleeding.  </p>
<p>If you forget to take Arixtra

forgotten dose.<br />
* If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
