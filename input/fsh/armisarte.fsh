have not received prior chemotherapy. </p>
<p>Armisarte is also given in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of patients with advanced 
stage of lung cancer. </p>
<p>Armisarte can be prescribed to you if you have lung cancer at an advanced stage if your disease has 
responded to treatment or it remains largely unchanged after initial chemotherapy. </p>

- if you are allergic to pemetrexed or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you are breast-feeding; you must discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with Armisarte. 
- if you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or hospital pharmacist before receiving Armisarte. 
If you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or 
hospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive Armisarte. 
Before each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient 
kidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive Armisarte. Your 
doctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition and if 
your blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make sure that 
you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving cisplatin to 
prevent vomiting. </p>
<p>If you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early 
or late radiation reaction with Armisarte. </p>
<p>If you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects 
with Armisarte. </p>
<p>If you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid 
before giving you Armisarte. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this 
medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Armisarte 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as medicines called 
“nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products” (NSAIDs), including medicines purchased 
without a doctor’s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There are many sorts of NSAIDs with different 
durations of activity. Based on the planned date of your infusion of Armisarte and/or on the status of 
your kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you 
can take them. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are NSAIDs. </p>
<p>Like other chemotherapy medicines Armisarte is not recommended with live attenuated vaccines. 
Inactive vaccines should be used where possible. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. The 
use of Armisarte should be avoided during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential 
risk of taking Armisarte during pregnancy. Women must use effective contraception during treatment 
with Armisarte and for 6 months after receiving the last dose. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. 
Breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with Armisarte. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Men are advised not to father a child during and up to 3 months following treatment with Armisarte 
and should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with Armisarte and for up to 
3 months afterwards. If you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the 3 months 
following receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. Armisarte can affect your 
ability to have children. Talk to your doctor to seek advice about sperm storage before starting your 
therapy. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Armisarte may make you feel tired. Be careful when driving a car or using machines. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Armisarte 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion will always be given to you by a healthcare 
professional. The dose of Armisarte is 500 milligrams for every square metre of your body’s surface 
area. Your height and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. Your doctor will 
use this body surface area to work out the right dose for you. This dose may be adjusted, or treatment 
may be delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. A hospital 
pharmacist, nurse or doctor will have mixed the Armisarte concentrate with 5% glucose solution for 
injection or 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection before it is given to you. </p>
<p>You will always receive Armisarte by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion will last 
approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p>When using Armisarte in combination with cisplatin: 
The doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. 
Cisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after 
the infusion of Armisarte has finished. The infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 hours. </p>
<p>You should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. </p>
<p>Additional medicines:<br />
Corticosteriods: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 milligram of 
dexamethasone twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day 
after Armisarte treatment. This medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity of skin 
reactions that you may experience during your anticancer treatment. </p>
<p>Vitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin 
containing folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are receiving 
Armisarte. You must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first dose of Armisarte. 
You must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of Armisarte. You will also 
receive an injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of Armisarte 
and then approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of Armisarte treatment). Vitamin 
B12 and folic acid are given to you to reduce the possible toxic effects of the anticancer treatment. </p>
<p>Your condition will be closely monitored during treatment. This routinely involves blood tests, 
including checks on your liver and kidney function. Your dose may be changed or treatment delayed 
depending on results from these tests. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
