<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
You may develop anaemia, a reduced number of red blood cells, or other blood changes after 
treatment with this medicine. Some changes to numbers of blood cells can occur while you are being 
treated and usually recover after stopping treatment for malaria. However, some individuals develop 
severe anaemia that can occur up to several weeks after completing treatment for malaria. In most 
cases, the anaemia recovers without any specific treatment. In a small number of cases the anaemia 
may be severe and require blood transfusion. Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests that can 
include a direct antiglobulin test to determine if treatment, e.g. with corticosteroids, is necessary and 
monitor your recovery for 4 weeks after you have completed your treatment for malaria. It is 
important you attend appointments for these check-ups. Talk to your doctor for more information. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Artesunate Amivas 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines not on prescription. </p>
<p>Some medicines should not be taken with artesunate because they could reduce its effect on malaria. 
Some examples include: 
* rifampicin (to treat bacterial infections) 
* ritonavir, nevirapine (anti-HIV medication) 
* carbamazepine, phenytoin (to treat epilepsy) </p>
<p>Some medicines may increase blood levels of artesunate and may increase the risk of side effects. 
Some examples include: 
* diclofenac (to treat pain or inflammation) 
* axitinib, vandetanib and imatinib (used in the treatment of certain cancers)   </p>
<p>Artesunate may increase or decrease the blood levels of some other medicines. Your doctor will advise 
you on taking any medicines during artesunate treatment. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, you 
should talk to your doctor before being given this medicine.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of taking Artesunate Amivas during pregnancy. 
Use in the first trimester of pregnancy is not recommended unless your doctor decides that the benefit 
of treatment for you outweighs the risk to your unborn child. In the later stages of pregnancy, you 
should only take Artesunate Amivas if your doctor feels that there are no suitable alternative 
medicines.  </p>
<p>If you are or become pregnant during treatment with this medicine, the doctor will report your 
pregnancy to the manufacturer, who is keeping a record in order to understand any effects that the 
treatment may have on the pregnancy and the baby. </p>
<p>Traces of this medicine may be present in your breast milk. It is not known if these could have any 
effect on a breastfed baby. If you are planning to breastfeed, discuss with your doctor whether the 
benefits of breastfeeding to you and your baby outweigh the potential risk.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You should not drive or use machines if you feel tired or dizzy. </p>
<p>Artesunate Amivas contains sodium 
This medicine contains 193 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each single dose. 
This is equivalent to just under 10 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for 
an adult.<br />
As the first and second doses are recommended 12 hours apart, this would supply 386 mg sodium 
(nearly 20 %of your maximum daily intake). </p>         </div>"""

three doses, if you still cannot take medicines by mouth, you will be given one dose of Artesunate 
Amivas every 24 hours (once a day) until you are able to take a different malaria treatment by mouth. </p>
<p>It is very important that you complete a full course of antimalarial treatment taken by mouth after you 
have had at least three doses of Artesunate Amivas by injection. </p>
<p>If you are given more Artesunate Amivas than you should

blood test showing low blood cell counts, weakness, fatigue, fever and nausea. Your doctor will help 
to treat these symptoms if you are given too much of this medicine.  </p>

required dose at the earliest opportunity and continue to give future doses 12 or 24 hours apart.  </p>
