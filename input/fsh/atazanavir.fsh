inhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a 
protein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your 
body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way Atazanavir Krka reduces the risk 
of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.
Atazanavir Krka capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor 
has prescribed Atazanavir Krka for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired 
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV 
medicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with Atazanavir 
Krka is best for you.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Atazanavir Krka is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other
illnesses linked to HIV infection.
Some people will need special care before or while taking Atazanavir Krka. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking Atazanavir Krka and make sure your doctor knows:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have hepatitis B or C</li>
<li>if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach)</li>
<li>if you have type A or B haemophilia</li>
<li>if you require haemodialysis
Atazanavir Krka may affect how well your kidneys work.
Kidney stones have been reported in patients taking atazanavir. If you develop signs or symptoms of 
kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your 
doctor immediately.
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response,
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you
notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the
opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system
attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your 
HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in 
hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, 
please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor.
Hyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients
receiving atazanavir. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these 
symptoms please inform your doctor.
Serious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking
atazanavir. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately.
If you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor.
Children receiving Atazanavir Krka may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will 
decide this.
Children
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The 
use of Atazanavir Krka in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been
studied due to the risk of serious complications.

treat allergic symptoms or asthma).
Atazanavir Krka with food and drink

breast-feed while taking Atazanavir Krka.

soon as possible.

Krka, by the other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you 
notice anything unusual about your health.
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV

the face, inflammation of the eye which causes redness (conjunctivitis), painful, warm, or red 
lumps (nodules).
-
