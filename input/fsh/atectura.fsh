  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Atectura Breezhaler is and how it works 
Atectura Breezhaler contains two active substances called indacaterol and mometasone furoate. </p>
<p>Indacaterol belongs to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. It relaxes the muscles of the small 
airways in the lungs. This helps to open the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of the 
lungs. When it is taken regularly, it helps the small airways to remain open. </p>
<p>Mometasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids (or steroids). 
Corticosteroids reduce the swelling and irritation (inflammation) in the small airways in the lungs and 
so gradually ease breathing problems. Corticosteroids also help to prevent attacks of asthma. </p>
<p>What Atectura Breezhaler is used for 
Atectura Breezhaler is used regularly as treatment for asthma in adults and adolescents (12 years of 
age and older). </p>
<p>Asthma is a serious, long-term lung disease where the muscles surrounding the smaller airways 
become tight (bronchoconstriction) and inflamed. Symptoms come and go and include shortness of 
breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. </p>
<p>You should use Atectura Breezhaler every day and not only when you have breathing problems or 
other symptoms of asthma. This will ensure that it controls your asthma properly. Do not use this 
medicine to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Atectura Breezhaler works or why this medicine has been 
prescribed for you, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. </p>

<li>tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (medicines used in the treatment of 
depression). </li>
<li>any medicines that may be similar to Atectura Breezhaler (contain similar active substances);

propranolol) or to treat glaucoma (e.g. timolol). </li>
<li>ketoconazole or itraconazole (medicines used to treat fungal infections) </li>
<li>ritonavir, nelfinavir or cobicistat (medicines used to treat HIV infection). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding

your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you can 
use Atectura Breezhaler. </p>

This medicine contains about 25 mg of lactose per capsule. If you have been told by your doctor that 
you have an intolerance to some sugars, speak with your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

once a day. Do not use more than your doctor tells you to use. </p>
<p>You should use Atectura Breezhaler every day, even when your asthma is not troubling you. </p>
<p>When to inhale Atectura Breezhaler 
Inhale Atectura Breezhaler at the same time each day. This will help control your symptoms

<p>How to inhale Atectura Breezhaler 
- Atectura Breezhaler is for inhalation use. 
- In this pack, you will find an inhaler and capsules that contain the medicine. The inhaler enables 
you to inhale the medicine in the capsule. Only use the capsules with the inhaler provided in this 
pack. The capsules should remain in the blister until you need to use them. 
- Peel the backing away from the blister to open it, do not push the capsule through the foil.

- Dispose of the inhaler in each pack after all capsules in that pack have been used. 
- Do not swallow the capsules. 
- Please read the instructions for use on the other side of this leaflet for more information 
on how to use the inhaler. </p>
<p>If your pack contains a sensor for Atectura Breezhaler 
- The sensor for Atectura Breezhaler is for adult use only. It should not be used in adolescents 
(12 years of age and older) as the App does not have patient consent verification or caregiver 
account functionality. 
- The sensor and App are not required in order for you to take your medicine. The sensor does not 
need to be connected to the App when taking your medicine. 
- Your doctor will decide whether use of the sensor and App is appropriate for you. 
- The electronic sensor for Atectura Breezhaler is to be attached to the base of the Atectura 
Breezhaler inhaler. 
- The sensor confirms that you have used the Atectura Breezhaler inhaler by recording and 
monitoring its actuations and the whirring noise of the spinning capsule during inhalation but it 
will not monitor whether you have received the dose of your medicine. 
- The sensor is to be used with the Propeller App on your smart phone or another suitable device. 
The sensor links with the Propeller App via Bluetooth. 
- Please read the instructions for use provided in the sensor pack and the App for more 
information on how to use the sensor for Atectura Breezhaler and the App. 
- After all Atectura Breezhaler capsules in a pack have been used, move the sensor to the new 
inhaler in the next Atectura Breezhaler pack. </p>

If you accidently inhale too much of this medicine, contact your doctor or hospital for advice 
immediately. You may need medical attention. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Atectura Breezhaler 
If you forget to inhale a dose at the usual time, inhale one as soon as possible on that day. Then inhale 
the next dose at the usual time on the next day. Do not inhale two doses on the same day. </p>
<p>If you stop using Atectura Breezhaler 
Do not stop using Atectura Breezhaler unless your doctor tells you to. Your asthma symptoms may
