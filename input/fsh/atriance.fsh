<p>Atriance is used to treat patients with:

abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells. The abnormal high number of white 
blood cells can appear in the blood and other parts of the body. The type of leukaemia relates to 
the type of white blood cell mainly involved. In this case, its cells are called lymphoblasts.

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>The majority of side effects reported with Atriance were seen in adults, children and adolescents. 
Some of the side effects were reported more often in adult patients. There is no known reason for this. </p>
<p>If you have any concerns, discuss them with your doctor. </p>
<p>Most serious side effects </p>
<p>These may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance. 
* Signs of infection. Atriance may reduce the number of white blood cells and lower your 
resistance to infection (including pneumonia). This can even be life threatening. Signs of an 
infection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>fever </li>
<li>serious deterioration of your general condition </li>
<li>local symptoms such as sore throat, sore mouth or urinary problems (for example, a 
burning sensation when urinating, which may be a urinary infection) 
Tell your doctor immediately if you get any of these. A blood test will be taken to check possible 
reduction of white blood cells. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other very common side effects 
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance 
* Changes in the sense of feeling in hands or feet, muscle weakness appearing as difficulty getting 
up from a chair, or difficulty walking (peripheral neuropathy); reduced sensitivity to light 
touch, or pain; abnormal sensations such as burning and, prickling, a sensation of something 
crawling on the skin. 
* Feeling generally weak and tired (temporary anaemia). In some cases you may need a blood 
transfusion. 
* Unusual bruising or bleeding, caused by a decrease in the number of clotting cells in the blood. 
This can lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. Rarely, it can 
lead to even more severe bleeding (haemorrhage). Talk to your doctor for advice on how to 
minimize the risk of bleeding. 
* Feeling drowsy and sleepy; headache; dizziness. 
* Shortness of breath, difficult or laboured breathing; cough. 
* Feeling of an upset stomach (nausea); being sick/throwing up (vomiting); diarrhoea; 
constipation 
* Muscle pain. 
* Swelling of parts of the body due to accumulation of abnormal amounts of fluid (oedema). 
* High body temperature (fever); tiredness; feeling weak/loss of strength. 
Tell a doctor if any of these becomes troublesome. </p>
<p>Common side effects </p>
<p>These may affect up to 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance: 
* Violent, uncontrollable muscular contractions often accompanied by unconsciousness that can 
be due to an epileptic attack (seizures). 
* Clumsiness and lack of coordination affecting balance, walking, limb or eye movements, or 
speech. 
* Unintentional rhythmic shaking of one or more limbs (tremors). 
* Muscle weakness (possibly associated with peripheral neuropathy   see above), joint pain, back 
pain; pains in hands and feet including a sensation of pins and needles sensation and numbness. 
* Lowered blood pressure. 
* Weight loss and loss of appetite (anorexia); stomach pains; sore mouth, mouth ulcers or 
inflammation. 
* Problems with memory, feeling disoriented; blurred vision; altered or loss of sense of taste 
(dysgeusia). 
* Build up of fluid around the lungs leading to chest pain and difficulty in breathing (pleural 
effusion); wheezing 
* Increased amounts of bilirubin in your blood, which may cause yellowing of the skin and may 
make you feel lethargic. 
* Increases in blood levels of liver enzymes. 
* Increases in blood creatinine levels (a sign of kidney problems, which might lead less frequent 
urination). 
* The release of tumour cell contents (tumour lysis syndrome), which may put extra stress on your 
body. Initial symptoms including nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, an irregular 
heartbeat, clouding of urine, lethargy and/or joint discomfort. If this does occur, it is most likely 
to occur at the first dose. Your doctor will take appropriate precautions to minimise the risk of 
this. 
* Low blood levels of some substances:</p>
<ul>
<li>low calcium levels, which may cause muscle cramps, abdominal cramps or spasms </li>
<li>low magnesium levels, which may cause muscle weakness, confusion, "jerky" 
movements, high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms and decreased reflexes with 
severely low blood magnesium levels. </li>
<li>low potassium levels may cause a feeling of weakness </li>
<li>low glucose levels, which may cause nausea, sweating, weakness, faintness, confusion or 
hallucinations. 
Tell a doctor if any of these becomes troublesome. </li>
</ul>
<p>Rare side effects </p>
<p>These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Atriance 
* Serious disease that destroys skeletal muscle characterized by the presence of myoglobin (a 
breakdown product of muscle cells) in the urine (Rhabdomyolysis), increase in blood creatine 
phosphokinase. 
Tell a doctor if any of these becomes troublesome. </p>
