* ritonavir or cobicistat, used to treat HIV 
* ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections  </p>
<p>Your doctor will assess whether you should take Avamys with these medicines. Your doctor may wish to

Avamys.  </p>
<p>Avamys should not be used at the same time with other nasal sprays containing steroids. </p>

<p>Allergic reactions to Avamys are rare and affect less than 1 person in 1,000. In a small number of people, 
allergic reactions can develop into a more serious, even life-threatening problem if not treated. Symptoms 
include: 
- becoming very wheezy, coughing or having difficulty with breathing 
- suddenly feeling weak or light-headed (which may lead to collapse or loss of consciousness) 
- swelling around the face 
- skin rashes or redness. </p>

they are potentially serious — so, if you notice any of these symptoms: 
Contact a doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)

<p>STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO USING THE NASAL SPRAY  </p>
<p>What the nasal spray looks like<br />
The nasal spray comes in an amber glass bottle inside a plastic casing - see picture a. It will contain either 
30, 60 or 120 sprays, depending on the pack size that has been prescribed for you. </p>
<p>The window in the plastic casing lets you see how much Avamys is left in the bottle. You will be able to 
see the liquid level for a new 30 or 60 spray bottle, but not in a new 120 spray bottle because the liquid 
level is above the window.<br />
Six important things you need to know about using the nasal spray<br />
<em> Avamys comes in an amber glass bottle. If you need to check how much is left hold the nasal 
spray upright against a bright light. You will then be able to see the level through the window. <br />
</em> When you first use the nasal spray you will need to shake it vigorously with the cap on for about 
10 seconds. This is important as Avamys is a thick suspension that becomes liquid when you shake 
it well - see picture b. It will only spray when it becomes liquid. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mist-release button must be pressed firmly all the way in, to release the mist through the 
nozzle - see picture c.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have difficulty pressing the button with your thumb, you can use two hands – see picture d </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always keep the cap on the nasal spray when you are not using it. The cap keeps the dust out, 
seals in the pressure and stops the nozzle from blocking up. When the cap is in place the mist-
release button cannot be pressed accidentally. </p>
</li>
<li>Never use a pin or anything sharp to clear the nozzle. It will damage the nasal spray </li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing the nasal spray for use  </p>
<p>You must prepare the nasal spray:  </p>
<ul>
<li>before you use it for the first time </li>
<li>if you have left the cap off for 5 days or the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more. </li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing the nasal spray helps to make sure you always get the full dose of medicine. Follow these steps: 
1 
Shake the nasal spray vigorously with the cap on for about 10 seconds. <br />
2 
Remove the cap by squeezing firmly on the sides of the cap with your thumb and forefinger– see 
picture e.  </p>
<p>3 
Hold the nasal spray upright, then tilt and point the nozzle away from you.<br />
4 
Press the button firmly all the way in. Do this at least 6 times until it releases a fine mist of spray 
into the air  – see picture f. </p>
<p>The nasal spray is now ready for use.  </p>
<p>Using the nasal spray<br />
1 
Shake the nasal spray vigorously.<br />
2 
Remove the cap.<br />
3 
Blow your nose to clear your nostrils, then tilt your head forward a little bit. 
4 
Place the nozzle in one of your nostrils – see picture g.  Point the end of the nozzle slightly 
outwards, away from the centre ridge of your nose. This helps to get the medicine to the correct part 
of your nose. 
5 
Press the button firmly all the way in, while you breathe in through your nose – see picture h.  </p>
<p>6 
Take the nozzle out and breathe out through your mouth. 
7 
If your dose is 2 sprays in each nostril repeat steps 4 to 6. 8 
Repeat steps 4 to 7 to treat the other nostril. 
9 
Replace the cap on the nasal spray. </p>
<p>Cleaning the nasal spray<br />
After each use:<br />
1 
Wipe the nozzle and inside of the cap with a clean, dry tissue – see pictures i and j.  </p>
<p>2 
Do not use water to clean it.<br />
3 
Never use a pin or anything sharp on the nozzle.<br />
4 
Always replace the cap once you have finished. 
 If the nasal spray does not seem to be working:<br />
<em> Check you still have medicine left. Look at the level through the window. If the level is very low 
there may not be enough left to work the nasal spray. 
* Check the nasal spray for damage<br />
</em> If you think the nozzle may be blocked, don’t use a pin or anything sharp to clear it.<br />
<em> Try to reset it by following the instructions under ‘Preparing the nasal spray for use’.<br />
</em> If it is still not working, or if it produces a jet of liquid, take the nasal spray back to the pharmacy to 
get advice.  </p>         </div>"""
