AYVAKYT is a medicine containing the active substance avapritinib.  </p>
<p>What AYVAKYT is used for 
AYVAKYT is used in adults to treat aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis 
with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one 
systemic therapy. These are disorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type of white 
blood cell. Symptoms are caused when too many mast cells enter various organs of your body, such as 
the liver, bone marrow or spleen. These mast cells also release substances such as histamine which 
cause various general symptoms that you may be experiencing as well as damage to involved organs. 
ASM, SM-AHN and MCL are collectively referred to as advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM). </p>
<p>AYVAKYT is also used for the treatment of adults with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) with 
moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic treatment. This is a disorder in 
which your body has many abnormal mast cells. Mast cells are the white blood cells responsible for 
allergic reactions. These cells may be in any tissue in your body but are often found in your skin, your 
intestines and your bone marrow. These abnormal mast cells can cause symptoms such as severe 
allergic reactions, diarrhoea, rash and difficulty thinking. </p>
<p>How AYVAKYT works 
AYVAKYT stops the activity of a group of proteins in the body called kinases. Mast cells in patients 
with AdvSM and ISM usually have changes (mutations) in the genes involved in making specific 
kinases associated with the growth and spread of these cells.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how AYVAKYT works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, please ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking AYVAKYT:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have suffered a vascular aneurysm (bulging and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or 
bleeding in your brain in the last year. </li>
<li>if you have low platelet counts. </li>
<li>If you are taking a medicine that thins the blood to prevent blood clots such as warfarin or 
phenprocoumon. </li>
</ul>
<p>Take special care with this medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may develop symptoms such as severe headache, vision problems, severe sleepiness, or 
severe weakness on one side of your body (signs of bleeding in your brain). If these occur, 
contact your doctor immediately and temporarily stop treatment. For patients with AdvSM, your 
doctor will evaluate your platelet counts before you start treatment and monitor them as needed 
during your treatment with avapritinib. </li>
<li>Treatment with this medicine may lead to a higher risk of bleeding in patients with AdvSM. 
Avapritinib can cause bleeding in the digestive system such as stomach, rectum, or intestine. Tell 
your doctor if you had or have any bleeding problems. Before you start taking avapritinib your 
doctor may decide to do blood tests. Get medical help immediately, if you get the following 
symptoms: passing blood in the stools or passing black stools, stomach pain, coughing/vomiting 
up blood. </li>
<li>You may also develop memory loss, changes in memory, or be confused (signs of a cognitive 
effect). Avapritinib can sometimes change how you think and how you remember information. 
Contact your doctor in case you experience these symptoms or in case a family member, caregiver 
or someone who knows you notices that you are getting forgetful or confused. </li>
<li>During treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very 
quickly, develop swelling of your face or limbs, have difficulty breathing or become short of 
breath. This medicine may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention can occur in 
patients with AdvSM).  </li>
<li>Avapritinib may cause abnormality of your heart rhythm. Your doctor may conduct tests to 
evaluate these problems during your treatment with avapritinib. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, 
faint, or have abnormal heartbeats while taking this medicine.  </li>
<li>You may get severe stomach and bowel problems (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) if you 
have AdvSM. Get medical help immediately if you experience these symptoms. </li>
<li>You may become more sensitive to the sun while taking this medicine. It is important to cover 
sun-exposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). </li>
</ul>
<p>While you are taking avapritinib, your doctor will ask you to have regular blood tests and weigh you 
regularly if you have AdvSM. </p>
