Azacitidine Accord is an anti-cancer agent which belongs to a group of medicines called ‘anti-
metabolites’. Azacitidine Accord contains the active substance ‘azacitidine’. </p>
<p>What Azacitidine Accord is used for 
Azacitidine Accord is used in adults who are not able to have a stem cell transplantation to treat: 
- higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). 
- chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). 
- acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). </p>
<p>These are diseases which affect the bone marrow and can cause problems with normal blood cell 
production. </p>
<p>How Azacitidine Accord works 
Azacitidine Accord works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine becomes incorporated 
into the genetic material of cells (ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). It is 
thought to work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the 
production of new RNA and DNA. These actions are thought to correct problems with the maturation 
and growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill 
cancerous cells in leukaemia. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Azacitidine Accord works or why 
this medicine has been prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""
