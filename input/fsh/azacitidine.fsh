Azacitidine betapharm is an anti-cancer agent which belongs to a group of medicines called  anti-
metabolites . Azacitidine betapharm contains the active substance  azacitidine . </p>
<p>What Azacitidine betapharm is used for 
Azacitidine betapharm is used in adults who are not able to have a stem cell transplantation to treat: 
* higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). 
* chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). 
* acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). </p>
<p>These are diseases which affect the bone marrow and can cause problems with normal blood cell 
production. </p>
<p>How Azacitidine betapharm works 
Azacitidine betapharm works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine becomes 
incorporated into the genetic material of cells (ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA)). It is thought to work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by 
interfering with the production of new RNA and DNA. These actions are thought to correct problems 
with the maturation and growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic 
disorders, and to kill cancerous cells in leukaemia. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Azacitidine betapharm works or why 
this medicine has been prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""
