treat Parkinson’s disease). </p>
<p>With Parkinson’s disease, there is a loss of cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a 
chemical in the brain involved in movement control. AZILECT helps to increase and sustain levels of

- If you are allergic to rasagiline or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). 
- If you have severe liver problems.  </p>
<p>Do not take the following medicines while taking AZILECT: 
- Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g. for treatment of depression or Parkinson’s disease, 
or used for any other indication), including medicinal and natural products without prescription 
e.g. St. John's Wort. 
- Pethidine (a strong pain killer). 
You must wait at least 14 days after stopping AZILECT treatment and starting treatment with MAO 
inhibitors or pethidine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking AZILECT 
- If you have any liver problems 
- You should speak with your doctor about any suspicious skin changes. Treatment 
with AZILECT may possibly increase the risk of skin cancer. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing unusual behaviours where 
you cannot resist the impulse, urges or cravings to carry out certain harmful or detrimental activities to 
yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders. In patients taking AZILECT and/or 
other medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease, behaviours such as compulsions, obsessive 
thoughts, addictive gambling, excessive spending, impulsive behaviour and an abnormally high sex 
drive or an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings have been observed. Your doctor may need to adjust 
or stop your dose (see section 4). </p>
<p>AZILECT may cause drowsiness and may cause you to suddenly fall asleep during day 
time activities, especially if you are taking other dopaminergic medicinal products (used 
for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease). For further information please refer to section 
driving and using machines. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is no relevant use of AZILECT in children and adolescents. Therefore, AZILECT is not 
recommended for use under the age of 18.<br />
Other medicines and AZILECT 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Especially tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
- Certain antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants)<br />
- The antibiotic ciprofloxacin used against infections 
- The cough suppressant dextromethorphan 
- Sympathomimetics such as those present in eye drops, nasal and oral decongestants and cold 
medicine containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine 
The use of AZILECT together with the antidepressants containing fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should 
be avoided. 
If you are starting treatment with AZILECT, you should wait at least 5 weeks after stopping fluoxetine 
treatment. 
If you are starting treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, you should wait at least 14 days after 
stopping AZILECT treatment. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are smoking or intend to stop smoking. Smoking could decrease 
the amount of AZILECT in the blood. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>You should avoid taking AZILECT if you are pregnant, as the effects of AZILECT on pregnancy and 
the unborn child are not known. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ask your doctor for advice before you drive and operate machines, since Parkinson’s disease itself as 
well as the treatment with AZILECT may influence your ability to do so. AZILECT can make you feel 
dizzy or drowsy; it can also cause episodes of sudden sleep onset. 
This might be enhanced if you take other medicines to treat the symptoms of your Parkinson’s disease, 
or if you take medicines which can make you feel drowsy, or if you drink alcohol while taking 
AZILECT. If you have experienced somnolence and/or episodes of sudden sleep onset before, or 
while taking AZILECT do not drive or operate machinery (see section 2). </p>         </div>"""

be taken with or without food.  </p>
<p>If you take more AZILECT than you should 
If you think that you may have taken too many AZILECT tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist 
immediately. Take the AZILECT carton/ blister or bottle with you to show the doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Symptoms reported following overdose of AZILECT included slightly euphoric mood (light form of 
mania), extremely high blood pressure and serotonin syndrome (see section 4). </p>
<p>If you forget to take AZILECT 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose normally, when it is 
time to take it. </p>
