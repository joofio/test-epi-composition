Azomyr contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine. </p>
<p>How Azomyr works<br />
Azomyr is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your allergic 
reaction and its symptoms. </p>
<p>When Azomyr should be used<br />
Azomyr relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages 
caused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults and adolescents 
12 years of age and older. These symptoms include sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy palate, and 
itchy, red or watery eyes.  </p>
<p>Azomyr is also used to relieve the symptoms associated with urticaria (a skin condition caused by an 
allergy). These symptoms include itching and hives. </p>
<p>Relief of these symptoms lasts a full day and helps you to resume your normal daily activities and 
sleep. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Regarding the duration of treatment, your physician will determine the type of allergic rhinitis you are 
suffering from and will determine for how long you should take Azomyr. 
If your allergic rhinitis is intermittent (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less 
than 4 weeks), your physician will recommend you a treatment schedule that will depend on the 
evaluation of the history of your disease. 
If your allergic rhinitis is persistent (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more 
than 4 weeks), your physician may recommend you a longer term treatment. </p>
<p>For urticaria, the duration of treatment may be variable from patient to patient and therefore you 
should follow the instructions of your physician. </p>
<p>If you take more Azomyr than you should<br />
Take Azomyr only as it is prescribed for you. No serious problems are expected with accidental

nurse immediately. </p>
