- if you have severe kidney problems. 
- if you are allergic to brinzolamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you are allergic to medicines called sulphonamides. Examples include medicines used to treat 
diabetes and infections and also diuretics (water tablets). AZOPT may cause the same allergy. 
- if you have too much acidity in your blood (a condition called hyperchloraemic acidosis). </p>
<p>If you have further questions, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AZOPT: 
- if you have kidney or liver problems. 
- if you have dry eyes or cornea problems. 
- if you are taking other sulphonamide medicines 
- if you have a specific form of glaucoma in which the pressure inside the eye rises due to 
deposits that block fluid draining out (pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma) or 
a specific form of glaucoma in which the pressure inside the eye (sometimes rapidly) rises 
because the eye bulges forward and blocks fluid draining out (narrow-angle glaucoma) 
- if you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores after 
using AZOPT or other related medicines. </p>
<p>Take special care with AZOPT: 
Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been 
reported in association with brinzolamide treatment. Stop using AZOPT and seek medical attention 
immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to these serious skin reactions described in 
section 4.<br />
Children and adolescents 
AZOPT is not to be used by infants, children or adolescents under 18 years of age unless advised by 
your doctor. </p>
<p>Other medicines and AZOPT 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>If you are taking another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dorzolamide, see 
section 1 What AZOPT is and what it is used for), talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Women who may become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during AZOPT 
treatment. The use of AZOPT is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Do not use 
AZOPT unless clearly indicated by your doctor. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines until your vision is clear. You may find that your vision is blurred for a 
time just after using AZOPT. </p>
<p>AZOPT may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and/or physical 
coordination. If affected, take care when driving or using machines. </p>

<p>Only use AZOPT for your eyes. Do not swallow or inject. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 
1 drop in the affected eye or eyes twice a day - morning and night. 
Use this much unless your doctor told you to do something different. Only use AZOPT in both eyes if 
your doctor told you to. Take it for as long as your doctor told you to. </p>
<p>How to use </p>
<p>1

3 </p>
<ul>
<li>Get the AZOPT bottle and a mirror </li>
<li>Wash your hands </li>
<li>Shake the bottle and twist off the cap. After the cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar 
is loose, remove before using product. </li>
<li>Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and middle finger </li>
<li>Tilt your head back. Pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between 
the eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 1) </li>
<li>Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use the mirror if it helps </li>
<li>Do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could 
infect the drops </li>
<li>Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of AZOPT at a time. </li>
<li>Do not squeeze the bottle: it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs 
(picture 2) </li>
<li>After using AZOPT, press a finger to the corner of your eye, by the nose (picture 3) for at least 
1 minute. This helps to stop AZOPT getting into the rest of the body. </li>
<li>If you take drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. </li>
<li>Put the bottle cap back on firmly immediately after use </li>
<li>Use up one bottle before opening the next bottle. </li>
</ul>
<p>If a drop misses your eye, try again. </p>
<p>If you are using other eye drops, leave at least 5 minutes between putting in AZOPT and the other 
drops. Eye ointments should be administered last. </p>
<p>If you use more AZOPT than you should 
If you get too much in your eyes, rinse it all out with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until 
it’s time for your next regular dose. </p>
<p>If you forget to use AZOPT 
Use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular routine. Do not use a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using AZOPT 
If you stop using AZOPT without speaking to your doctor, the pressure in your eye will not be 
controlled which could lead to loss of sight. </p>         </div>"""
