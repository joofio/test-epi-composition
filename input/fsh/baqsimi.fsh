glycogenolytic hormones. It is used to treat severe hypoglycaemia (very low blood sugar) in people 
with diabetes. It is for use in adults, adolescents, and children aged 4 years or older. </p>
<p>Glucagon is a natural hormone produced by the pancreas. It works in the opposite way to insulin and 
raises blood sugar. It does this by converting stored sugar in the liver called glycogen to glucose (a 
form of sugar that the body uses for energy). The glucose then enters the bloodstream and raises the 
blood sugar level, so reducing the effects of hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>You should always carry Baqsimi with you and tell your friends and family that you are carrying it. </p>         </div>"""

If you are at risk of severe hypoglycaemia you should always have Baqsimi readily available:<br />
- show your family members, friends, or people you work with where you keep this medicine and 
explain when and how to use it. Delay in treatment may be harmful. It is important they know 
how to use Baqsimi before you need it. </p>
<p>Do not use Baqsimi 
- if you are allergic to glucagon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have phaeochromocytoma, which is a tumour in the adrenal gland (a gland above your 
kidneys). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Baqsimi: 
- if you have a tumour in your pancreas called insulinoma. 
- if you have insufficient liver glycogen. This could occur: 
- in states of starvation. <br />
- if your adrenal gland does not produce enough cortisol or aldosterone.<br />
- if you suffer from chronic hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using Baqsimi. </p>
<p>After using Baqsimi, eat as soon as possible to prevent the recurrence of low blood sugar. Take a fast-
acting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugar-containing carbonated drink. </p>
<p>Children 
Baqsimi is not recommended for children under 4 years of age because it has not been studied in this 
age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Baqsimi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>The following medicines can affect the way Baqsimi works: 
- insulin â€“ used to treat diabetes. Insulin has the opposite effect of glucagon on blood sugar. 
- indometacin, used to treat joint pain and stiffness. Indometacin reduces the effect of glucagon. </p>
<p>The following medicines may be affected by Baqsimi: 
- warfarin, used to prevent blood clots. Baqsimi may increase the anticlotting effect of warfarin. 
- beta-blockers, used to treat high blood pressure and irregular heart beat. Baqsimi may increase 
blood pressure and pulse.  This will only last a short time. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If your blood sugar drops very low when you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you can use Baqsimi. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Wait until the effects of very low blood sugar have worn off, before driving or using any tools or 
machines. </p>         </div>"""
