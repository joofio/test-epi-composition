  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Bavencio contains the active substance avelumab, a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that 
attaches to a specific target in the body called PD-L1. PD-L1 is found on the surface of certain tumour cells, and helps protect them from the immune system 
(the body s natural defences). Bavencio binds to PD-L1, and blocks this protective effect, allowing the 
immune system to attack the tumour cells. </p>
<p>Bavencio is used in adults to treat: 
* Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare type of skin cancer, when it is metastatic (has spread to 
other parts of the body). 
* Urothelial carcinoma (UC), a cancer that originates in the urinary tract, when it is advanced 
or metastatic (has spread beyond the urinary bladder or to other parts of the body). Bavencio is 
used as maintenance treatment if the tumour has not grown after so called platinum-based 
chemotherapy as the first treatment.<br />
* Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer, when it is advanced (has spread beyond 
the kidney or to other parts of the body). </p>
<p>For renal cell cancer, Bavencio is to be used in combination with axitinib. </p>
<p>It is important that you also read the package leaflet for the medicine containing axitinib. If you have 
any questions about axitinib, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

if you are allergic to avelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Blood tests and weight checks: 
Your doctor will check your general health before and during treatment with Bavencio. 
You will have blood tests during your treatment and your doctor will monitor your weight before and 
during treatment. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before receiving Bavencio: 
It may cause side effects (see section 4). Please note that in some cases symptoms may be delayed, and 
may develop after your last dose. If you suffer from any of these you should seek urgent medical 
attention: 
* infusion-related reactions; 
* problems due to inflammation of your lungs (pneumonitis); 
* inflammation of your liver (hepatitis) or other liver problems; 
* inflammation of your intestines (colitis), diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or more bowel 
movements than usual; 
* inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis); 
* inflammation of your heart (myocarditis); 
* problems with your hormone producing glands (the thyroid, adrenal and pituitary glands) that 
may affect how these glands work; 
* Type 1 diabetes, including a serious, sometimes life-threatening problem due to acid in the 
blood produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis); 
* problems with your kidneys; 
* inflammation of your muscles (myositis); 
* problems due to inflammation of your lungs, skin, eyes and/or lymph nodes (sarcoidosis). </p>
<p>If you experience any of these symptoms when taking Bavencio do not try to treat them on your own 
with other medicines. Your doctor may 
* give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, 
* withhold the next dose of Bavencio, 
* or stop your treatment with Bavencio altogether. </p>
<p>Check with your doctor or nurse before you receive Bavencio if: 
* you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); 
* you have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS); 
* you have ever had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C 
(HCV); 
* you receive medicines to suppress your immune system; 
* you have had an organ transplant. </p>
<p>Bavencio acts on your immune system. It may cause inflammation in parts of your body. Your risk of 
these side effects may be higher if you already have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the 
body attacks its own cells). You may also experience frequent flares of your autoimmune disease, 
which in the majority of cases are mild. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Bavencio has not been studied in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Bavencio 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Bavencio can cause harm to your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You must not use Bavencio if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use effective contraceptives while you are 
being treated with Bavencio and for at least 1 month after your last dose. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while receiving Bavencio and for at least 1 month after your last dose. </p>
<p>It is unknown if Bavencio passes into your breast milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be 
excluded. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines after you have received Bavencio if you are not feeling well enough. 
Tiredness is a very common side effect of Bavencio and can affect your ability to drive or to use 
machines. </p>
<p>Bavencio has a low sodium content 
Bavencio contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each dose and therefore is essentially 
sodium-free. </p>         </div>"""

The recommended dose of avelumab is 800 mg every 2 weeks. Your doctor will decide how many 
treatments you need. </p>
<p>How you will receive Bavencio 
You will receive Bavencio as an infusion (a drip) into a vein (intravenously) over a period of 1 hour. 
Bavencio will be added to an infusion bag containing a sodium chloride solution before use. </p>
<p>Before you receive Bavencio 
For at least the first 4 treatments, you will receive paracetamol and an antihistamine before being 
given Bavencio, to help to prevent possible side effects related to the infusion. Depending on how 
your body responds to treatment, your doctor may decide to continue giving you these medicines 
before all of your Bavencio treatments. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Bavencio 
It is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive Bavencio. If you miss an 
appointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose. </p>
<p>If you stop receiving Bavencio 
Do not stop treatment with Bavencio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. Stopping your 
treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. </p>
