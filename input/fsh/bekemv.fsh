<p>BEKEMV contains the active substance eculizumab and it belongs to a class of medicines called 
monoclonal antibodies. Eculizumab binds to and inhibits a specific protein in the body that causes 
inflammation and so prevents your body s systems from attacking and destroying vulnerable blood 
cells.  </p>
<p>What is BEKEMV used for  </p>
<p>Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria </p>
<p>BEKEMV is used to treat adults and children with a certain type of disease affecting the blood system 
called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH). In patients with PNH, their red blood cells can 
be destroyed which can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, 
dark urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. Eculizumab can block the body s inflammatory 
response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable PNH blood cells. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to eculizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have fructose intolerance, a quite rare genetic condition where the enzyme for breaking 
down fructose is not produced.<br />
- Children below 2 years of age must not receive this medicine. This medicine contains sorbitol 
and sorbitol may be fatal in hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). In babies and children below 
2 years of age HFI may not yet be diagnosed. (See special warnings at the end of this section 
under subtitle  BEKEMV contains sorbitol ). 
- If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless you take antibiotics to 
reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
- If you have a meningococcal infection. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections alert </p>
<p>BEKEMV treatment may reduce your natural resistance to infections, especially against certain 
organisms that cause meningococcal infection (severe infection of the linings of the brain and sepsis) 
and other Neisseria infections including disseminated gonorrhoea. </p>
<p>Consult your doctor before you take BEKEMV to be sure that you receive vaccination against 
Neisseria meningitidis, an organism that causes meningococcal infection, at least 2 weeks before 
beginning therapy, or that you take antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you 
have been vaccinated. </p>
<p>Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should also be aware that 
vaccination may not prevent this type of infection. In accordance with national recommendations, your 
doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to prevent infection. </p>
<p>If you are at risk of gonorrhoea, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>Meningococcal infection symptoms </p>
<p>Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating certain types of infection in patients who 
receive BEKEMV, you will be provided a card to carry with you, listing specific trigger symptoms. 
This card is named:  Patient Safety Card . </p>
<p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>headache with nausea or vomiting </li>
<li>headache with a stiff neck or back </li>
<li>fever </li>
<li>rash </li>
<li>confusion </li>
<li>severe muscle aches combined with flu-like symptoms </li>
<li>sensitivity to light </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling </p>
<p>If you are travelling in a remote region where you are unable to contact your doctor or in which you 
find yourself temporarily unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor can make arrangements to 
issue, as a preventive measure, a prescription for an antibiotic to counter Neisseria meningitidis that 
you keep with you. If you experience any of the symptoms amongst those cited above, you should take 
the antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should see a doctor as soon as possible, 
even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. </p>
<p>Infections  </p>
<p>Before starting BEKEMV, inform your doctor if you have any infections. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions  </p>
<p>BEKEMV contains a protein and proteins can cause allergic reactions in some people. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents  </p>
<p>Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections. </p>
<p>Older people  </p>
<p>There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over. </p>
<p>Other medicines and BEKEMV  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential </p>
<p>The use of effective contraception during treatment and up to 5 months after treatment should be 
considered in women who are able to get pregnant. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>BEKEMV has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>BEKEMV contains sorbitol  </p>
<p>This medicine contains 50 mg sorbitol in each mL. </p>
<p>Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare 
genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break 
down fructose, which may cause serious side effects. </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your 
child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects 
such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. </p>
<p>Sodium </p>
<p>BEKEMV contains sodium when diluted with sodium chloride. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium free .<br />
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicinal product 
contains 0.34 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per 180 mL at the maximal dose. This 
is equivalent to 17.0% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You 
should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection, this medicinal product 
contains 0.18 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per 180 mL at the maximal dose, 
equivalent to 9.0% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You 
should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.<br />
If your health care professional dilutes BEKEMV vials with 5% glucose solution, the medicinal 
product is essentially  sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

severely soon. Your doctor will discuss the possible side effects with you and explain the risks. Your 
doctor will want to monitor you closely for at least 8 weeks. </p>
<p>The risks of stopping BEKEMV include an increase in the destruction of your red blood cells, which 
may cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>A significant fall in your red blood cell counts (anaemia), </li>
<li>Confusion or change in how alert you are, </li>
<li>Chest pain, or angina, </li>
