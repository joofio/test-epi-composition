Warnings and precautions
-
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using BeneFIX.
-
See your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected.
-
Allergic reactions are possible. The product may contain traces of hamster proteins (see Do not 
take BeneFIX). Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions)
have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX. Early signs of allergic reactions 
include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, generalised urticaria, 
tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure, blurred vision and anaphylaxis (severe 
allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/or breathing, red or swollen face 
and/or hands). 
-
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact a 
doctor or seek emergency medical care immediately. In case of severe allergic reactions, 
alternative therapy should be considered. 
-
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in patients who have 
received previous treatment with factor IX-containing products. However, as with all factor IX 
products you should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors while 
being treated with BeneFIX. 
-
Research has shown a link between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic 
reactions. Therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as those described above, you 
should be tested for the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with a factor 
IX inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with BeneFIX.
-
The production of factor IX in the body is controlled by the factor IX gene. Patients who have 
specific mutations of their factor IX gene such as major deletion may be more likely to develop 
an inhibitor to factor IX and/or experience allergic reactions. Therefore if you are known to 
have such a mutation your doctor may monitor you more closely for signs of an allergic 
reaction particularly when you first start to take BeneFIX.
-
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, your initial administrations of BeneFIX
should be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic 
reactions can be provided.
-
Even in the absence of factor IX inhibitor, higher doses of BeneFIX may be needed than 
required for other plasma-derived factor IX products that you may have taken previously. 
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity (which measures the ability of your 
blood to form clots) has to be performed to adjust doses as appropriate. If bleeding is not 
controlled with the recommended dose, contact your doctor.
-
If you suffer from liver or heart disease or if you have recently had surgery, there is an 
increased risk for blood clotting (coagulation) complications.
-
A kidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome) has been reported following high doses of 
plasma-derived factor IX in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of 
allergic reactions.
-
Sufficient data have not been obtained from clinical studies on the treatment of previously 
untreated patients (patients who have never received a previous infusion of factor IX), with 
BeneFIX.
-
It is recommended that evey time you use BeneFIX, you record the name and batch number of 
the product. You can use one of the peel-off labels found on the vial to document the batch 
number in your diary or for reporting any side effects.
Other medicines and BeneFIX
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, you 
should only take BeneFIX upon specific instructions from your doctor. It is not known whether 
BeneFIX can cause harm to an unborn baby when given to pregnant women. Your doctor may advise 
you to stop treatment with BeneFIX if you are breast-feeding or become pregnant.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
BeneFIX has no influence on the ability to drive or use machines.
BeneFIX contains sodium
After reconstitution, BeneFIX contains 0.2 mmol sodium (4.6 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . However, depending on your body weight and your dose of BeneFIX, you could 
receive multiple vials. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a low salt diet.</p>         </div>"""

Your doctor will decide the dose of BeneFIX you will receive. This dose and duration will depend 
upon your individual needs for replacement factor IX therapy and how quickly your body uses up 
factor IX, which will be checked regularly. You may notice a difference in the dose you receive if you 
are changing from a plasma-derived factor IX product to BeneFIX.
Your doctor may decide to change the dose of BeneFIX you receive during your treatment.
Reconstitution and administration 
The procedures below are provided as guidelines for the reconstitution and administration of 
BeneFIX. Patients should follow the specific venipuncture procedures provided by their doctor.
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion after reconstitution of the powder for injection 
with the supplied solvent (a sodium chloride (salt) solution) in the pre-filled syringe.
Always wash your hands prior to performing the following procedures. Aseptic technique (meaning 
clean and germ free) should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
Reconstitution:
BeneFIX will be administered by intravenous infusion (IV) after reconstitution with sterile solvent for 
injection.
1. Allow the vial of lyophilised (freeze-dried) BeneFIX and the pre-filled syringe to reach room 
temperature.
2. Remove the plastic flip-top cap from the BeneFIX vial to expose the central portion of the
rubber stopper.
3. Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab provided, or use another antiseptic solution and 
allow to dry. After cleaning do not touch the rubber stopper with your hand or allow it to touch 
any surface.
4. Peel back the lid from the clear plastic vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from 
the package.
5. Place the vial on a flat surface. While holding the adapter in the package, place the vial adapter 
over the vial. Press down firmly on the package until the adapter snaps into place on top of the 
vial, with the adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper.
6. Lift the package away from the adapter and discard the package.</p>         </div>"""
