that target cancer cells. These medicines are called antineoplastic agents.
BESPONSA is used to treat adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia is a cancer of blood where you have too many white blood cells. BESPONSA is intended 
for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for adult patients who have previously tried other 
treatments and for whom those treatments have failed.
BESPONSA acts by attaching to cells with a protein called CD22. Lymphoblastic leukaemia cells 
have this protein. Once attached to the lymphoblastic leukaemia cells, the medicine delivers a 
substance into the cells that interferes with the cells  DNA and eventually kills them.</p>         </div>"""

<p>are allergic to inotuzumab ozogamicin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).</p>
<p>have previously had severe venoocclusive disease (a condition in which the blood vessels in the 
liver become damaged and blocked by blood clots) which was confirmed or have ongoing 
venoocclusive disease.</p>
<p>have serious ongoing liver disease, e.g., cirrhosis (a condition in which the liver does not 
function properly due to long-term damage), nodular regenerative hyperplasia (a condition with 
signs and symptoms of portal hypertension that can be caused by chronic use of medicines), 
active hepatitis (a disease characterised by inflammation of the liver).
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given BESPONSA if you:</p>
<p>have a history of liver problems or liver diseases or if you have signs and symptoms of a serious 
condition called hepatic venoocclusive disease, a condition in which the blood vessels in the 
liver become damaged and blocked by blood clots. Venoocclusive disease may be fatal and is 
associated with rapid weight gain, pain in the upper right side of your abdomen (belly), increase 
in the size of the liver, build-up of fluid causing abdominal swelling, and blood tests showing 
increases in bilirubin and/or liver enzymes (that may result in yellowing of the skin or eyes). 
This condition may occur during treatment with BESPONSA or after subsequent treatment with 
a stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to transplant another person s stem 
cells (cells which develop into new blood cells) into your bloodstream. This procedure may take 
place if your disease responds completely to treatment.</p>
<p>have signs or symptoms of a low number of blood cells known as neutrophils (sometimes 
accompanied with fever), red blood cells, white blood cells, lymphocytes, or a low number of 
blood components known as platelets; these signs and symptoms include developing an 
infection or fever or bruising easily or getting frequent nose bleeds.</p>
<p>have signs and symptoms of an infusion related reaction, such as fever and chills or breathing 
problems during or shortly after the BESPONSA infusion.</p>
<p>have signs and symptoms of tumour lysis syndrome, which may be associated with symptoms in 
the stomach and intestines (for example, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), heart (for example, 
changes in the rhythm), kidney (for example, decreased urine, blood in urine), and nerves and 
muscles (for example, muscular spasms, weakness, cramps), during or shortly after the 
BESPONSA infusion. </p>
<p>have a history of, or tendency to have, QT interval prolongation (a change in electrical activity 
of the heart that can cause serious irregular heart rhythms), are taking medicines that are known 
to prolong QT interval, and/or have abnormal electrolyte (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium)
levels.</p>
<p>have elevations in amylase or lipase enzymes that may be a sign of problems with your pancreas 
or liver and gallbladder or bile ducts.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you became pregnant during the period of 
treatment with BESPONSA and for up to 8 months after finishing treatment. 
Your doctor will take regular blood tests to monitor your blood counts during treatment with 
BESPONSA. See also section 4. During treatment, especially in the first few days after starting treatment, your white blood cell count
may be severely lowered (neutropenia), which may be accompanied by fever (febrile neutropenia). 
During treatment, especially in the first few days after starting treatment, you may have raised liver 
enzymes. Your doctor will take regular blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes during treatment 
with BESPONSA. 
Treatment with BESPONSA may prolong QT interval (a change in electrical activity of the heart that 
can cause serious irregular heart rhythms). Your doctor will take an electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
blood tests to measure electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) before the first dose of 
BESPONSA and repeat these tests during treatment. See also section 4. Your doctor will also monitor for signs and symptoms of tumour lysis syndrome after you receive 
BESPONSA. See also section 4. Children and adolescents
BESPONSA should not to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because limited
data are available in this population.
Other medicines and BESPONSA
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this medicine.
Contraception 
You must avoid becoming pregnant or fathering a child. Women must use effective contraception 
during treatment and for at least 8 months after the final dose of treatment. Men must use effective 
contraception during treatment and for at least 5 months after the final dose of treatment.
Pregnancy
The effects of BESPONSA in pregnant women are not known, but based on its mechanism of action
BESPONSA may harm your unborn baby. You should not use BESPONSA during pregnancy, unless 
your doctor thinks that it is the best medicine for you. 
Contact your doctor immediately if you or your partner becomes pregnant during the period of 
treatment with this medicine.

Men and women should seek advice regarding fertility preservation before treatment.
Breast-feeding
If you need treatment with BESPONSA, you must stop breast-feeding during treatment and for at least 
2 months after treatment. Talk to your doctor.

use machines.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 mg inotuzumab ozogamicin, that is to 
say essentially  sodium-free. </p>         </div>"""

How BESPONSA is given</p>
<p>Your doctor will decide on the correct dose. </p>
<p>A doctor or nurse will give you BESPONSA through a drip in your vein (intravenous infusion) 
which will run for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Each dose is given weekly and each treatment cycle is 3 doses.</p>
<p>If the medicine works well and you are going to receive a stem cell transplant (see section 2), 
you may receive 2 cycles or a maximum of 3 cycles of treatment.</p>
<p>If the medicine works well, but you are not going to receive a stem cell transplant (see section 
2), you may receive up to a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment. </p>
<p>If you do not respond to the medicine within 3 cycles, your treatment will be stopped.</p>
<p>Your doctor may change your dose, interrupt, or completely stop treatment with BESPONSA if 
you have certain side effects.</p>
<p>Your doctor may lower your dose based on your response to treatment.</p>
<p>Your doctor will do blood tests during the treatment to check for side effects and for response to 
treatment.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.
Medicines given before treatment with BESPONSA
Before your treatment with BESPONSA, you will be given other medicines (pre-medications) to help 
reduce infusion reactions and other possible side effects. These may include corticosteroids (e.g.,
dexamethasone), antipyretics (medicines to reduce fever), and antihistamines (medicines to reduce 
allergic reactions).
Before your treatment with BESPONSA, you may be given medicines and be hydrated to prevent 
tumour lysis syndrome from occurring. Tumour lysis syndrome is associated with a variety of 
symptoms in the stomach and intestines (for example, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), heart (for 
example, changes in the rhythm), kidney (for example, decreased urine, blood in urine), and nerves 
and muscles (for example, muscular spasms, weakness, cramps).</p>         </div>"""
