- if you are allergic to ropeginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if you have thyroid disease that is not controlled with medicines. 
- if you have or had severe mental disorders (such as depression or suicidal thoughts or if you 
tried to kill yourself). 
- if you have recently had severe heart problems (such as heart attack or stroke)<br />
- if you have or had an autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or 
inflammatory bowel disease). 
- if you had an organ transplantation and you take medicines which suppress your immune 
system. 
- if you take telbivudine (a medicine used to treat hepatitis B infection). 
- if you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease. 
- if you have severe kidney disease (with your kidneys working at less than 15% of their normal 
ability). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Besremi: 
- if you have thyroid disease. 
- if you have diabetes or high blood pressure − your doctor may ask you to have an eye 
examination. 
- if you have liver problems − you will have blood tests regularly to check how your liver is 
working if you are on a long-term Besremi therapy. 
- if you have kidney problems. 
- if you have psoriasis or other skin problems because they may get worse during treatment with 
Besremi. </p>
<p>Once you have started Besremi treatment, talk to your doctor: 
- if you develop symptoms of depression (such as feelings of sadness, dejection, and suicidal 
thoughts). 
- if you develop signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing or 
hives) while using Besremi – if this is the case you will need to seek medical help immediately. 
- if you develop symptoms of a cold or other respiratory infection (such as difficulty in breathing, 
cough, fever and chest pain). 
- if you have changes in your vision − you must tell your doctor and have an immediate eye 
examination. Severe eye problems may occur during Besremi therapy. Your doctor will usually 
check your vision before starting your treatment. If you have health problems which may lead to 
eye problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure, you doctor should check your vision also 
during treatment. If your vision worsens, your doctor may decide to discontinue your treatment. </p>
<p>Dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, can occur with interferon medicines. In 
addition, dry mouth could damage teeth and the lining of the mouth during long-term treatment with 
Besremi. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental checks. </p>
<p>It will need a certain time to reach your individual optimal dose of Besremi. Your doctor will decide if 
it is necessary to treat you with another medicine for an early reduction of your blood cell number to 
prevent blood clots and bleeding. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents because no information is available on the use of 
Besremi in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Besremi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use Besremi if you are taking telbivudine (for treating hepatitis B) since the combination of 
these medicines increases the risk of peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or burning sensations 
in the arms and legs). Tell your doctor if you are being treated with telbivudine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor especially if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
- theophylline (a medicine used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma) 
- methadone (a medicine used to treat pain or opioid dependence) 
- vortioxetine or risperidone (medicines used to treat mental disorders) 
- anti-cancer medicines such as those stopping or slowing the growth of blood-forming cells in 
the bone marrow (e.g. hydroxycarbamide) 
- medicines that work on the central nervous system to relieve pain, help you sleep, or have a 
calming effect (e.g. morphine, midazolam) </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
The effect of Besremi during pregnancy is not known. The use of Besremi is not recommended during 
pregnancy. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, your doctor will discuss with you if effective 
birth control should be used during your treatment with Besremi. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if Besremi is present in breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide if you have to 
stop breast-feeding when you are using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you feel dizzy, sleepy or confused while using Besremi. </p>
<p>Besremi contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains 5 mg benzyl alcohol in each 0.5 mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice: 
- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
- if you have a liver or kidney disease. 
This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects 
(called “metabolic acidosis”). </p>
<p>Besremi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""
