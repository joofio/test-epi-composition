<p>Betaferon is a type of medicine known as interferon used to treat multiple sclerosis. Interferons are 
proteins produced by the body that help fight against attacks on the immune system such as viral 
infections. </p>
<p>How Betaferon works </p>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), 
particularly the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. In MS, inflammation destroys the protective 
sheath (called myelin) around the nerves of the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This 
is called demyelination. 
The exact cause of MS is unknown. An abnormal response by the body's immune system is thought to 
play an important part in the process which damages the CNS.  </p>
<p>The damage to the CNS can occur within an MS attack (relapse). It can cause disability temporarily, 
such as difficulty walking. Symptoms may disappear completely or partly. 
Interferon beta-1b has been shown to change the response of the immune system and to help to reduce 
disease activity. </p>
<p>How Betaferon helps fight your disease </p>
<p>Single clinical event indicating a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis: Betaferon has been 
shown to delay progression to definite multiple sclerosis. </p>
<p>Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: People with relapsing-remitting MS have occasional attacks 
or relapses during which symptoms become noticeably worse. Betaferon has been shown to cut down 
the number of attacks and make them less severe. It reduces the number of hospital stays due to the 
disease and prolongs the time without relapses. </p>
<p>Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: In some cases people with relapsing-remitting MS find 
that their symptoms increase and they progress to another form of MS called secondary progressive 
MS. With this, people find themselves becoming increasingly impaired, whether or not they have 
relapses. Betaferon can reduce the number and severity of the attacks, and slow the progression of 
disability. </p>
<p>What Betaferon is used for </p>
<p>Betaferon is for use in patients  </p>
<p>► 
who have experienced symptoms for the first time which indicate a high risk of developing 
multiple sclerosis. Your doctor will rule out any other reasons which could explain these 
symptoms before you are treated. </p>
<p>► 
who suffer from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with at least two relapses within 
the last two years. </p>
<p>► 
who suffer from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease shown by 
relapses.  </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human albumin or 
any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </li>
<li>if you currently suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts (see ‘Warnings and 
precautions’ and section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). </li>
<li>if you have severe liver disease (see ‘Warnings and precautions’, ‘Other medicines and 
Betaferon’ and section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). </li>
</ul>
<p>► Tell your doctor if any of the above applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you start using Betaferon: </p>
<p>− 
If you have monoclonal gammopathy. This is a disorder of the immune system where an 
abnormal protein is found in the blood. Problems with your small blood vessels (capillaries) 
may develop when using medicines like Betaferon (systemic capillary leak syndrome). This can 
lead to shock (collapse) and even be fatal. </p>
<p>− 
If you have had depression or are depressed or previously had thoughts of suicide. Your 
doctor will closely monitor you during treatment. If your depression and/or suicidal thoughts are 
severe, you will not be prescribed Betaferon (see also ‘Do not use Betaferon’). </p>
<p>− 
If you have ever had seizures or if you are taking medicines to treat epilepsy (anti-
epileptics), your doctor will monitor your treatment carefully (see also ‘Other medicines and 
Betaferon’ and section 4. ‘Possible side effects’). </p>
<p>− 
If you have severe kidney problems your doctor may monitor your kidney function during 
treatment. </p>
<p>Your doctor also needs to know the following whilst you are using Betaferon: </p>
<p>− 
If you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face 
and/or your tongue or sudden shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of a serious 
allergic reaction (hypersensitivity), which may become life threatening. </p>
<p>− 
If you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with Betaferon, or if 
you develop thoughts of suicide. If you become depressed while you are on Betaferon, you 
may need special treatment and your doctor will closely monitor you and may also consider 
stopping your treatment. If you suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts, you will 
not be treated with Betaferon (see also ‘Do not use Betaferon’). </p>
<p>− 
If you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be 
catching a lot of infections. These may be symptoms of a fall in your blood cell count or in the 
number of platelets in your blood (cells, which help the blood to clot). You may need extra 
monitoring by your doctor. </p>
<p>− 
If you have loss of appetite, fatigue, feeling sick (nausea), repeated vomiting, especially if 
you notice widespread itching, yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes, or easy 
bruising. These symptoms may suggest problems with your liver. Changes to the liver function 
values occurred in patients treated with Betaferon during clinical studies. As for other beta 
interferons, severe liver damage, including cases of liver failure, have been reported rarely in 
patients taking Betaferon. The most serious were reported in patients taking other medicines or 
who were suffering from diseases that can affect the liver (e.g. alcohol abuse, severe infection). </p>
<p>− 
If you experience symptoms like irregular heartbeat, swelling such as of the ankles or legs, 
or shortness of breath. This may suggest a disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) 
which has been reported rarely in patients using Betaferon. </p>
<p>− 
If you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back, and/or you feel sick or 
have a fever. This may suggest an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which has been 
reported with Betaferon use. This is often associated with an increase of certain blood fats 
(triglycerides). </p>
<p>► Stop using Betaferon and tell your doctor immediately if any of these happens to you.  </p>
<p>Other things to consider when using Betaferon </p>
<p>− 
You will need blood tests to measure the number of your blood cells, blood chemistry and your 
liver enzymes. This will be done before you start using Betaferon, regularly after treatment 
with Betaferon has been initiated and periodically whilst you are on it, even if you have no 
particular symptoms. These blood tests will be in addition to the tests, which are normally done 
to monitor your MS. </p>
<p>− 
If you have a heart disease, the flu-like symptoms, which often occur at the start of 
treatment, may prove stressful to you. Betaferon must be used with caution, and your doctor 
will monitor you for worsening of your heart condition, particularly during the start of 
treatment. Betaferon itself does not affect the heart directly. </p>
<p>− 
You will have a check of the function of your thyroid gland, regularly or whenever thought 
necessary by your doctor for other reasons. </p>
<p>− 
Betaferon contains human albumin and therefore carries a potential risk for transmission 
of viral diseases. A risk of transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be ruled out. </p>
<p>− 
During treatment with Betaferon your body may produce substances called neutralising 
antibodies, which may react with Betaferon (neutralising activity). It is not yet clear whether 
these neutralising antibodies reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Neutralising antibodies 
are not produced in all patients. Currently it is not possible to predict which patients belong to 
this group. </p>
<p>− 
During treatment with Betaferon, kidney problems that may reduce your kidney function, 
including scarring (glomerulosclerosis), may occur. Your doctor may perform tests to check 
your kidney function. </p>
<p>− 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots 
could affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting 
Betaferon. Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the 
function of your kidney. </p>
<p>− 
Paleness, yellow skin or dark-colored urine, possibly accompanied by unusual dizziness, 
tiredness or shortness of breath may occur during your treatment. These may be symptoms 
of a breakdown of red blood cells. This might happen several weeks to several years after 
starting Betaferon. Your doctor may perform blood tests. Inform your doctor about other 
medicines that you are taking at the same time as Betaferon. </p>
<p>Injection site reactions </p>
<p>During Betaferon treatment you are likely to experience injection site reactions. Symptoms 
include redness, swelling, change in the skin colour, inflammation, pain and hypersensitivity. Infection 
around the injection site and skin breakdown and tissue damage (necrosis) are reported less frequently. 
Injection site reactions usually become less frequent over time. </p>
<p>Injection site skin and tissue breakdown can result in scars forming. If this is severe a doctor may have 
to remove foreign matter and dead tissue (debridement) and, less often, skin grafting is required and 
healing may take up to 6 months. </p>
<p>To reduce the risk of getting injection site reactions, such as infection or necrosis, you must: 
− 
use a sterile (aseptic) injection technique, 
− 
rotate the injection sites with each injection (see Annex ‘Self-injection procedure’, Part II, in the 
second part of this leaflet). </p>
<p>Injection site reactions may occur less frequently, if you use an auto-injector device and by rotating 
injection sites. Your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this. </p>
<p>If you experience any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or fluid leaking 
out from the injection site:  </p>
<p>► Stop injections with Betaferon and talk to your doctor </p>
<p>► If you have only one sore injection site (lesion) and the tissue damage (necrosis) is not 
too extensive you may continue using Betaferon.  </p>
<p>► If you have more than one sore injection site (multiple lesions) you must stop using 
Betaferon until your skin has healed. </p>
<p>Your doctor will regularly check the way you inject yourself, particularly if you have experienced 
injection site reactions. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>There have been no formal clinical trials undertaken in children or adolescents. 
However, there is some data available in children and adolescents from 12 to 16 years. This data 
suggests that the safety profile from this age is the same as in adults for use of Betaferon 8.0 million 
IU under the skin every other day. There is no information on the use of Betaferon in children under 
12 years of age. Therefore, Betaferon should not be used in this population. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Betaferon </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>No formal interaction studies have been carried out to find out whether Betaferon affects other 
medicines or is affected by them.  </p>
<p>Using Betaferon with other medicines that modify the immune system response is not recommended, 
except anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids or the adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH). </p>
<p>Betaferon should be used with caution with: 
- medicines which need a certain liver enzyme system (known as cytochrome P450 system) for 
their removal from the body, for example medicines used to treat epilepsy (like phenytoin).<br />
- medicines which affect the production of blood cells. </p>
<p>Betaferon with food and drink </p>
<p>Betaferon is injected under the skin so any food or drink you consume is not thought to have any 
effect on Betaferon. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Betaferon can be used during 
breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Betaferon may cause side effects in the central nervous system (see section 4. ‘Possible side effects’). 
If you are especially sensitive, this might affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Betaferon contains mannitol, human albumin and sodium </p>
<p>The inactive ingredients of Betaferon include<br />
• small amounts of mannitol, a naturally occurring sugar and human albumin, a protein. 
• Sodium - this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>
<p>If you know that you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the ingredients or if you become so, you 
must not use Betaferon. </p>         </div>"""
