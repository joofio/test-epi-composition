- having to empty your bladder more than usual (called increased urinary frequency) 
- not being able to control when to empty your bladder (called urgency incontinence) </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to mirabegron or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
- if you have very high uncontrolled blood pressure. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Betmiga: 
- if you have trouble emptying your bladder or you have a weak urine stream or if you take other 
medicines for the treatment of overactive bladder such as anticholinergic medicines. 
- if you have kidney or liver problems. Your doctor may need to reduce your dose or may tell you 
not to take Betmiga, especially if you are taking other medicines such as itraconazole, 
ketoconazole (fungal infections), ritonavir (HIV/AIDS) or clarithromycin (bacterial infections). 
Tell your doctor about the medicines that you take. 
- if you have an ECG (heart tracing) abnormality known as QT prolongation or you are taking 
any medicine known to cause this such as: 
o medicines used for abnormal heart rhythm such as quinidine, sotalol, procainamide, 
ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, and amiodarone; 
o medicines used for allergic rhinitis; 
o antipsychotic medicines (medicines for mental illness) such as thioridazine, 
mesoridazine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine; 
o anti-infectives such as pentamidine, moxifloxacin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. </p>
<p>Mirabegron may cause your blood pressure to increase or make your blood pressure worse if you have 
a history of high blood pressure. It is recommended that your doctor check your blood pressure while 
you are taking Mirabegron. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and 
efficacy of Betmiga in this age group has not been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Betmiga 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Betmiga may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how this medicine 
works. 
- Tell your doctor if you use thioridazine (a medicine for mental illness), propafenone or 
flecainide (medicines for abnormal heart rhythm), imipramine or desipramine (medicines used 
for depression). These specific medicines may require dose adjustment by your doctor. 
- Tell your doctor if you use digoxin (a medicine for heart failure or abnormal heart rhythm). 
Blood levels of this medicine are measured by your doctor. If the blood level is out of range, 
your doctor may adjust the dose of digoxin. 
- Tell your doctor if you use dabigatran etexilate (a medicine which is used to reduce the risk of 
brain or body vessel obstruction by blood clot formation in adult patients with an abnormal 
heart beat (atrial fibrillation) and additional risk factors). This medicine may require dose 
adjustment by your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby you should not take 
Betmiga. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is 
likely that this medicine passes into your breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you should 
take Betmiga or breastfeed. You should not do both. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There is no information to suggest that this medicine affects your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose is one 50 mg tablet by mouth once daily. If you have kidney or liver 
problems, your doctor may need to reduce your dose to one 25 mg tablet by mouth once daily. You 
should take this medicine with liquids and swallow the tablet whole. Do not crush or chew the tablet. 
Betmiga can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more Betmiga than you should 
If you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes 
your tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist or hospital for advice immediately. </p>
<p>Symptoms of overdose may include a forceful beating of the heart, an increased pulse rate or an 
increased blood pressure. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Betmiga 
If you forget to take your medicine, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is less than 
6 hours before your next scheduled dose, skip the dose and continue to take your medicine at the usual 
time. </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you miss several doses, tell your doctor 
and follow the advice given to you. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Betmiga 
Do not stop treatment with Betmiga early if you do not see an immediate effect. Your bladder might 
need some time to adapt. You should continue taking your tablets. Do not stop taking them when your 
bladder condition improves. Stopping treatment may result in recurrence of symptoms of overactive 
bladder. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Betmiga without talking to your doctor first, as your overactive bladder symptoms 
may come back. </p>
