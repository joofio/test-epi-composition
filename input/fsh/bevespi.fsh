Bevespi Aerosphere is used to make breathing easier for adults who have a lung disease called chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a long-term disease of the airways in the lungs,
which is often caused by smoking. In COPD, the muscles around the airways tighten which makes 
breathing difficult. 
The medicine prevents the tightening of the muscles around the airways, making it easier for air to get 
in and out of the lungs.
Bevespi Aerosphere delivers the active substances directly to the airways in your lungs as you breathe 
in. It will help to reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.</p>         </div>"""
