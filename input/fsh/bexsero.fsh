<p>Bexsero contains four different components from the surface of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis 
group B. </p>
<p>Bexsero is given to individuals from 2 months of age and older to help protect against disease caused 
by the Neisseria meningitidis group B bacteria. These bacteria can cause serious, and sometimes 
life-threatening, infections such as meningitis (inflammation of the covering of the brain and spinal 
cord) and sepsis (blood poisoning). </p>
<p>The vaccine works by specifically stimulating the body’s natural defense system of the vaccinated 
person. This results in protection against the disease. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you or your child are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this 
vaccine (listed in section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child receive Bexsero: 
- if you or your child have a severe infection with a high temperature. If this is the case, then 
vaccination will be postponed. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not 
require postponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first. 
- if you or your child have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from 
clotting properly, such as treatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants). Talk to your doctor or 
nurse first. </p>
<ul>
<li>if you or your child receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as 
complement activation, such as eculizumab. Even if you or your child have been vaccinated 
with Bexsero you or your child remain at increased risk of disease caused by the Neisseria 
meningitidis group B bacteria. </li>
<li>if your child was born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks of pregnancy), particularly if they had 
breathing difficulties. Stopping breathing or irregular breathing for a short time may be more 
common in the first three days following vaccination in these babies and they may need special 
monitoring. </li>
<li>if you or your child have an allergy to the antibiotic kanamycin. If present, the kanamycin level 
in the vaccine is low. If you or your child may have an allergy to kanamycin, talk to your doctor 
or nurse first. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. </p>
<p>There are no data on the use of Bexsero in adults above 50 years of age. There are limited data on the use 
of Bexsero in patients with chronic medical conditions or with weakened immunity. If you or your child 
have weakened immunity (for example, due to the use of immunosuppressive medications, or HIV 
infection, or hereditary defects of the body’s natural defence system), it is possible that the effectiveness 
of Bexsero is reduced. </p>
<p>As with any vaccine, Bexsero may not fully protect all of those who are vaccinated. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Bexsero </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, or have recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Bexsero can be given at the same time as any of the following vaccine components: diphtheria, 
tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), Haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, hepatitis B, 
pneumococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and meningococcus A, C, W, Y. Talk to your 
doctor or nurse for further information. </p>
<p>When given at the same time with other vaccines Bexsero must be given at separate injection sites. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse may ask you to give your child medicines that lower fever at the time and after 
Bexsero has been given. This will help to reduce some of the side effects of Bexsero. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before Bexsero is given. Your doctor may still recommend that you receive 
Bexsero if you are at risk of exposure to meningococcal infection. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Bexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the 
effects mentioned under section 4 “Possible side effects” may temporarily affect the ability to drive or 
use machines. </p>
<p>Bexsero contains sodium chloride </p>
<p>This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
