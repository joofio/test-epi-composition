Bimzelx contains the active substance bimekizumab. </p>
<p>What Bimzelx is used for 
Bimzelx is used to treat the following inflammatory diseases:<br />
<em> Plaque psoriasis<br />
</em> Psoriatic arthritis 
* Axial spondyloarthritis, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing 
spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis<br />
Bimzelx is used in adults to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis. Bimzelx reduces the 
symptoms, including pain, itching, and scaling of the skin. </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis 
Bimzelx is used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a disease that causes 
inflamed joints, often accompanied by plaque psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis, you may 
first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough or in case of intolerance, 
you will be given Bimzelx either alone or in combination with another medicine called methotrexate. </p>
<p>Bimzelx reduces inflammation and can therefore help to reduce pain, stiffness, swelling in and around 
your joints, psoriatic skin rash, psoriatic nail damage and slow down the damage to the cartilage and 
bone of the joints involved in the disease. These effects can help you to control signs and symptoms of 
the disease, ease your normal daily activities, reduce tiredness, and improve your quality of life.  </p>
<p>Axial spondyloarthritis, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis 
(radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Bimzelx is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which 
causes inflammation of the spinal joints, called axial spondyloarthritis. If the condition is not visible 
using X-rays, it is referred to as “non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis”; if it occurs in patients with 
visible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as “ankylosing spondylitis” or “radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis”.  </p>
<p>If you have axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given Bimzelx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, reduce inflammation and improve your physical function. Bimzelx can help to reduce back 
pain, stiffness and tiredness, which can ease your normal daily activities and improve your quality of 
life. </p>
<p>How Bimzelx works 
Bimekizumab, the active substance in Bimzelx, belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) 
inhibitors. Bimekizumab works by reducing the activity of two proteins called IL-17A and IL-17F, 
which are involved in causing inflammation. There are higher levels of these proteins in inflammatory 
diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. </p>         </div>"""
