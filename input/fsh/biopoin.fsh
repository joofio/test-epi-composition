  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Biopoin is 
Biopoin contains the active substance epoetin theta, which is almost identical to erythropoietin, a 
natural hormone produced by your body. Epoetin theta is a protein produced by biotechnology. It 
works in exactly the same way as erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is produced in your kidneys and 
stimulates your bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Red blood cells are very important for 
distributing oxygen within your body. </p>
<p>What Biopoin is used for 
Biopoin is used for the treatment of anaemia accompanied by symptoms (for example fatigue, 
weakness and shortness of breath). Anaemia occurs when your blood does not contain enough red 
blood cells. Treatment for anaemia is given to adult patients with chronic renal failure or to adult 
patients with non-myeloid cancer (cancer not originating in the bone marrow) who at the same time 
are receiving chemotherapy (medicines to treat cancer). </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to epoetin theta, another epoetin or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6); 
- if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>General 
This medicine may not be suitable for the following patients. Please speak with your doctor if you 
belong to one of these patient groups: 
- patients with liver problems, 
- patients with pathological changes in their red blood cells (homozygous sickle cell anaemia). </p>
<p>Your blood pressure needs to be checked closely before and during treatment with this medicine. If 
your blood pressure rises, your doctor may give you medicines to reduce your blood pressure. If you 
are already taking a medicine to reduce your blood pressure, your doctor might increase the dose. It 
may also be necessary to reduce your dose of Biopoin or to stop the treatment with Biopoin for a short 
period of time. </p>
<p>If you get headaches, especially sudden, stabbing, migraine-like headaches, confusion, speech 
disturbance, unsteady walking, fits or convulsions, tell your doctor immediately. These may be signs 
of severely elevated blood pressure, even if your blood pressure is usually normal or low. It needs to 
be treated at once. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests in order to monitor various blood components and their 
levels. In addition, the iron level in your blood will be checked before and during treatment with this 
medicine. If your iron level is too low, your doctor may also prescribe you an iron preparation. </p>
<p>If you feel tired and weak or experience breathlessness, you must consult your doctor. These 
symptoms could indicate that your treatment with this medicine is ineffective. Your doctor will check 
that you do not have other causes of anaemia and may perform blood tests or examine your bone 
marrow. </p>
<p>Your healthcare professional will always record the exact product you are using. This can help to 
provide more information on the safety of medicines like this one. </p>
<p>Healthy people should not use Biopoin. The use of this medicine by healthy people can excessively 
increase certain blood parameters and in so doing cause problems with the heart or blood vessels that 
can be life threatening. </p>
<p>Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. SJS/TEN can appear initially as 
reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of 
mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are 
often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of 
the skin and life-threatening complications. If you develop a serious rash or another of these skin 
symptoms, stop using Biopoin and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. </p>
<p>Anaemia caused by chronic renal failure 
If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, your doctor will check that a particular blood parameter 
(haemoglobin) does not exceed a defined threshold. If this blood parameter becomes too high, heart or 
vascular problems might occur, increasing the risk of death. </p>
<p>If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to 
Biopoin, your doctor will check your dose of Biopoin because repeatedly increasing your dose of 
Biopoin if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of the heart 
or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. </p>
<p>If you have hardening of the blood vessels in your kidneys (nephrosclerosis) but do not need to 
undergo dialysis, your doctor will consider whether treatment is suitable for you. This is because one 
cannot rule out a possible acceleration of progression of kidney disease with absolute certainty. </p>
<p>If you are on dialysis, medicines that prevent blood coagulation are used. If you are being treated with 
Biopoin, the dose of the anticoagulant medicine may have to be increased. Otherwise the increased 
number of red blood cells may cause blocking of the arterio-venous fistula (an artificial connection 
between an artery and a vein which is surgically prepared in dialysis patients). </p>
<p>Anaemia in cancer patients 
If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that this medicine may act as a blood cell growth 
factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. Depending on your 
individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss this with your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because there are no data 
that show that this medicine is safe and works in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Biopoin 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Biopoin has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant or plan to get pregnant, as the doctor may decide that you should not use 
this medicine. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether the active substance in this medicine passes over to the breast milk. Therefore, 
your doctor may decide that you should not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Biopoin contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, i.e. essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Your treatment with this medicine is being initiated by a doctor who is experienced in the 
above-mentioned indications. </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is… 
The dose of Biopoin (expressed in International Units or IU) depends on your disease condition, your 
body weight and the way the injection is given (under the skin [subcutaneous injection] or into a vein 
[intravenous injection]). Your doctor will work out the right dose for you. </p>
<p>Anaemia caused by chronic renal failure 
The injections are given under the skin or into a vein. Patients on haemodialysis will usually receive 
the injection at the end of dialysis via an arterio-venous fistula. Patients who do not have to undergo 
dialysis are usally given the injections under the skin. Your doctor will carry out blood tests regularly 
and adjust the dosage or suspend the treatment if necessary. The haemoglobin values in your blood 
should not exceed a value of 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). Your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to 
control the symptoms of your anaemia. If you do not respond adequately to Biopoin, your doctor will 
check your dose and will inform you if you need to change doses of Biopoin. </p>
<p>Treatment with Biopoin is divided into two stages: 
a) Correcting the anaemia 
The initial dose for injections under the skin is 20 IU per kg of bodyweight, given 3 times per week. If 
necessary, your doctor will increase your dose at monthly intervals. </p>
<p>The initial dose for injections into veins is 40 IU per kg of bodyweight, given 3 times per week. If 
necessary, your doctor will increase your dose at monthly intervals. </p>
<p>b) Maintaining sufficient red blood cell levels 
Once an adequate number of red blood cells has been reached, the maintenance dose required to keep 
the number constant will be determined by your doctor. </p>
<p>In the case of injections under the skin, the weekly dose can be given either as 1 injection per week or 
as 3 divided injections per week. </p>
<p>In the case of injections into veins, your dosage may be switched to 2 injections weekly. </p>
<p>If the frequency of administration is changed, dose adjustments may be necessary. </p>
<p>Treatment with Biopoin is normally a long-term therapy. </p>
<p>The maximum dose should not exceed 700 IU per kg of bodyweight per week. </p>
<p>Anaemia in cancer patients 
Injections are given under the skin. The injection will be given once-weekly. The initial dose is 
20,000 IU. Your doctor will carry out blood tests regularly and adjust the dosage or suspend the 
treatment if necessary. The haemoglobin values in your blood should not exceed a value of 12 g/dl 
(7.45 mmol/l). You will usually receive Biopoin until 1 month after the end of chemotherapy. </p>
<p>The maximum dose should not exceed 60,000 IU. </p>
<p>How are the injections given? 
This medicine is given as an injection using a pre-filled syringe. The injection is given either into a 
vein (intravenous injection) or into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). </p>
<p>If you are receiving Biopoin as an injection under the skin, your doctor may suggest that you learn 
how to inject yourself this medicine. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this. 
Do not attempt to give this medicine to yourself without this training. Some of the information 
required for using the pre-filled syringe can be found at the end of this package leaflet (see section “7. Information for injecting yourself”). Proper treatment of your disease, however, requires close and 
constant co-operation with your doctor. </p>
<p>Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only. </p>
<p>If you use more Biopoin than you should 
Do not increase the dose your doctor has given you. If you think you have injected more Biopoin than 
you should, contact your doctor. It is unlikely to be serious. Even at very high blood levels, no 
symptoms of poisoning have been observed. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Biopoin 
If you have missed an injection, or injected too little, talk to your doctor. Do not inject a double dose 
to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Biopoin 
Before you stop using this medicine, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
