<ul>
<li>Budesonide belongs to a group of medicines called  corticosteroids  also known as  steroids .  It works 
by reducing and preventing swelling and inflammation in your lungs and helps you to breathe more 
easily.  </li>
<li>Formoterol fumarate dihydrate belongs to a group of medicines called  long-acting  2 adrenoceptor 
agonists  or  bronchodilators .  It works by relaxing the muscles in your airways. This will help to open 
the airways and help you to breathe more easily. </li>
</ul>
<p>BiResp Spiromax is indicated for use in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older only.  </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  </p>
<p>Asthma 
BiResp Spiromax can be prescribed for asthma in two different ways. </p>
<p>a)  You may be prescribed two asthma inhalers: BiResp Spiromax together with a separate  reliever 
inhaler  such as salbutamol. 
* Use BiResp Spiromax every day.  This helps to prevent asthma symptoms such as breathlessness and 
wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use the  reliever inhaler  when you get asthma symptoms, to make it easier to breathe again.  </p>
<p>b)  You may be prescribed BiResp Spiromax as your only asthma inhaler. 
* Use BiResp Spiromax every day.  This helps to prevent asthma symptoms such as breathlessness and 
wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use BiResp Spiromax when you need to take extra inhalations or puffs for relief of  asthma symptoms, 
to make it easier to breathe again and if agreed with the doctor also to prevent asthma symptoms from 
happening (for example, when exercising or on exposure to allergens). They do not need a separate 
inhaler for this.  </p>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
COPD is a long-term lung disease of the airways in the lungs, which is often caused by cigarette smoking.<br />
Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest discomfort and coughing up mucus. BiResp Spiromax 
can also be used to treat the symptoms of severe COPD in adults only.  </p>         </div>"""

<li>If you are using BiResp Spiromax for asthma, your doctor will want to regularly check your symptoms.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Asthma<br />
BiResp Spiromax can be prescribed for asthma in two different ways. The amount of BiResp Spiromax to 
use and when to use it depends on how it has been prescribed for you.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have been prescribed BiResp Spiromax and a separate reliever inhaler, read the section called (A) 
Using BiResp Spiromax and a separate  reliever inhaler .  </li>
<li>If you have been prescribed BiResp Spiromax as your only inhaler, read the section called (B) Using 
BiResp Spiromax as your only asthma inhaler. </li>
</ul>
<p>(A) Using BiResp Spiromax and a separate  reliever inhaler <br />
Use your BiResp Spiromax every day. This helps to prevent asthma symptoms from occurring. </p>
<p>Recommended dose:<br />
Adults (18 years and older) 
1 or 2 inhalations (actuations), twice a day, taken in the morning and in the evening.<br />
Your doctor may increase this to 4 inhalations, twice a day. 
If your symptoms are well controlled, your doctor may ask you to take your medicine once a day. </p>
<p>Adolescents (12 years and older) 
1 or 2 inhalations twice daily. </p>
<p>Your doctor will help you to manage your asthma and will adjust the dose of this medicine to the lowest dose 
that controls your asthma.  If your doctor feels that you need a lower dose than is available from your BiResp 
Spiromax, your doctor may prescribe an alternative inhaler containing the same active substances as your 
BiResp Spiromax but with a lower dose of the corticosteroid. If your symptoms are well controlled, your 
doctor may ask you to take your medicine once a day. However, do not adjust the number of inhalations your 
doctor has prescribed without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Use your separate  reliever inhaler  to treat asthma symptoms when they happen.<br />
Always keep your  reliever inhaler  with you and use it to relieve sudden attacks of breathlessness and 
wheezing.  Do not use BiResp Spiromax to treat these asthma symptoms. </p>
<p>(B) Using BiResp Spiromax as your only asthma inhaler </p>
<p>Only use BiResp Spiromax in this way if your doctor has told you to.  </p>
<p>Use your BiResp Spiromax every day. This helps to prevent asthma symptoms from occurring. </p>
<p>Recommended dose<br />
Adults and adolescents (12 years and older) </p>
<p>1 inhalation in the morning and 1 inhalation in the evening 
or 
2 inhalations in the morning<br />
or 
2 inhalations in the evening. </p>
<p>Your doctor may increase this to 2 inhalations twice a day.  </p>
<p>Also use BiResp Spiromax as a  reliever inhaler  to treat asthma symptoms when they happen and to 
prevent asthma symptoms from happening (for example, when exercising or on exposure to allergens).<br />
<em> If you get asthma symptoms, take 1 inhalation and wait a few minutes.<br />
</em> If you do not feel better, take another inhalation.<br />
* Do not take more than 6 inhalations at a single time. </p>
<p>Always keep your BiResp Spiromax with you and use it to relieve sudden attacks of breathlessness and 
wheezing. </p>
<p>A total daily dose of more than 8 inhalations is not normally needed.  However, your doctor may allow you 
to take up to 12 inhalations a day for a limited period.  </p>
<p>If you regularly need to use 8 or more inhalations a day, make an appointment to see your doctor.  They may 
need to change your treatment.  </p>
<p>Do NOT use more than 12 inhalations in total in 24 hours. </p>
<p>If you are doing exercise and you get asthma symptoms, use BiResp Spiromax as described here.  However, 
do not use BiResp Spiromax just before exercise to stop asthma symptoms from happening. </p>
<p>It is important that you discuss with your doctor the use of BiResp Spiromax to prevent asthma symptoms 
from happening; how often you exercise or how often you are exposed to allergens could impact the 
treatment that is prescribed to you. </p>
<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) </p>
<p>Recommended dose: 
Adults (18 years and older) only: 
2 inhalations twice a day, taken in the morning and in the evening </p>
<p>Your doctor may also prescribe another bronchodilator medicine, for example an anticholinergic (such as 
tiotropium or ipratropium bromide) for your COPD disease. </p>
<p>Preparing your new BiResp Spiromax  </p>
<p>Before using your new BiResp Spiromax for the first time, you need to prepare it for use as follows: 
  Open the foil pouch by tearing at the notch at the top of the foil pouch and take out the inhaler 
  Check the dose indicator to see that there are 120 inhalations in the inhaler. 
  Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label of the inhaler. 
  Do not shake your inhaler before use. </p>
<p>How to take an inhalation 
Every time you need to take an inhalation, follow the instructions below. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hold your inhaler with the semi-transparent wine red mouthpiece cover at the bottom. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the mouthpiece cover by folding it down until one loud click is heard. Your medicine is actively 
metered. Your inhaler is now ready for use. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe out through your inhaler. </p>
</li>
<li>Place the mouthpiece between your teeth. Do not bite the mouthpiece. Close your lips around the 
mouthpiece. Take care not to block the air vents. </li>
</ol>
<p>Breathe in through your mouth as deeply and as hard as you can. </p>
<ol>
<li>Remove your inhaler from your mouth.  You may notice a taste when you take your inhalation.  </li>
<li>Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. </li>
<li>Then breathe out gently (do not breathe out through the inhaler).  Close the mouthpiece cover.  </li>

Do not try to take your inhaler apart, remove or twist the mouthpiece cover, it is fixed to your inhaler and 
must not be taken off.  Do not use your Spiromax if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has come apart 
from your Spiromax. Do not open and close the mouthpiece cover unless you are about to use your inhaler.  </p>
<p>Cleaning your Spiromax 
Keep your Spiromax dry and clean. 
If necessary, you may wipe the mouthpiece of your Spiromax after use with a dry cloth or tissue. </p>
<p>When to start using a new Spiromax 
* The dose indicator tells you how many doses (inhalations) are left in your inhaler, starting with inhalations when it is full and ending with 0 (zero) inhalations when it is empty.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The dose indicator, on the rear of the device, shows the number of inhalations remaining as even 
numbers. The spaces between the even numbers represent the odd number of remaining inhalations.. </li>
<li>For inhalations remaining from 20 downwards to  8 , 6 , 4 , 2   the numbers are displayed in red on a 
white background. When the numbers become red in the window, you should consult your doctor and 
obtain a new inhaler. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note:<br />
<em> The mouthpiece will still  click  even when your Spiromax is empty. If you open and close the 
mouthpiece without taking an inhalation the dose indicator will still register it as a count. <br />
</em> This dose will be securely held inside the inhaler for when the next inhalation is due. It is impossible to 
accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation.<br />
* Keep the mouthpiece closed all the time unless you are about to use your inhaler.  </p>
<p>Important information about your asthma or COPD symptoms </p>
<p>If you feel you are getting breathless or wheezy while using BiResp Spiromax, you should continue to use 
BiResp Spiromax but go to see your doctor as soon as possible, as you may need additional treatment. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately if: 
* Your breathing is getting worse or you often wake up at night with breathlessness and wheezing. 
* Your chest starts to feel tight in the morning or your chest tightness lasts longer than usual. </p>
<p>These signs could mean that your asthma or COPD is not being properly controlled and you may need 
different or additional treatment immediately. </p>
<p>Once your asthma is well controlled your doctor may consider it appropriate to gradually reduce the dose of 
BiResp Spiromax. </p>
<p>If you use more BiResp Spiromax than you should 
It is important that you take your dose as advised by your doctor. You should not exceed your prescribed dose 
without seeking medical advice. </p>
<p>If you use more BiResp Spiromax than you should, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. 
The most common symptoms that may occur after when you use more BiResp Spiromax than you should are 
trembling, headache or a rapid heartbeat.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use BiResp Spiromax 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However do not take a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten dose. If it is nearly time for your next dose just take your next dose at the usual time.  </p>
<p>If you become wheezy or breathless, or develop any other symptoms of an asthma attack, use your  reliever 
inhaler , then seek medical advice.  </p>
<p>If you stop using BiResp Spiromax
