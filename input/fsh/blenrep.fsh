Warnings and precautions<br />
Eye problems<br />
BLENREP can cause dry eyes, blurred vision or other eye problems.<br />
You should have an eye examination by an eye specialist before starting treatment and for the next 
three doses of BLENREP. Your doctor may request further eye tests whilst on treatment with 
BLENREP. Even if your vision seems fine, it is important that you get your eyes checked during 
treatment with BLENREP because some changes can happen without symptoms and may only be seen 
on an eye examination. 
  Do not use contact lenses while you are receiving treatment. 
Your doctor will ask you to use eye drops called preservative-free artificial tears at least 4 times a day 
during treatment to moisten and lubricate your eyes. You should apply them as instructed. 
If you notice changes with your vision, your doctor may hold treatment with BLENREP or adjust the 
dose or ask you to see an eye specialist. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with BLENREP. 
  Contact your doctor if you have blurred vision or other eye problems.<br />
Abnormal bruising and bleeding  </li>
</ul>
<p>BLENREP can decrease the number of blood cells called platelets which help to clot your blood.<br />
Symptoms of low platelets counts (thrombocytopenia) include: 
* abnormal bruising under the skin, 
* bleeding longer than usual after a test, 
* bleeding from your nose or your gums or more serious bleeding.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test before you start treatment, and regularly during 
treatment with BLENREP, to check that your platelet levels are normal. 
  Tell your doctor if you develop abnormal bleeding or bruising, or any symptoms that 
worry you. 
Infusion-related reactions  </p>
<p>BLENREP is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein. Some people who receive infusions develop 
infusion-related reactions. 
  See  Infusion-related reactions  in Section 4. If you have previously had a reaction to an infusion of BLENREP, or any other medicine: 
  Tell your doctor or nurse before you receive another infusion. </p>
<p>Lung problems (Pneumonitis)  </p>
<p>Severe and life-threatening inflammation of the lungs has occurred in some people who received 
BLENREP.  </p>
<p>Possible symptoms of lung inflammation include: 
* Shortness of breath 
* Chest pain<br />
* New onset or worsening cough 
Your doctor may decide to hold or stop treatment with BLENREP if you have these symptoms.<br />
  Tell your doctor if you develop any lung problems or any breathing-related symptoms that 
worry you. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents  </p>
<p>This medicine is not intended for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and BLENREP 
  Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and fertility  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby: 
  Tell your doctor before you are given this medicine. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant: 
* Your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start treatment with BLENREP. 
* You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after your last dose 
of BLENREP.<br />
Women being treated with this medicine who wish to have children are advised to seek fertility 
counselling and consider options to freeze eggs/embryos before treatment. </p>
<p>If you are a man who could father a child: 
* You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after your last dose 
of BLENREP. 
Men being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before 
treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding  </p>
<p>You must not breast-feed during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose of BLENREP. 
It is not known if the medicine passes into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about this. 
Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>BLENREP can cause problems with vision that can affect your ability to drive or use machines.<br />
  Do not drive or use machines unless you are sure your vision is not affected. Talk to 
your doctor if you are not sure. 
BLENREP contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
