  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Blitzima is 
Blitzima contains the active substance  rituximab . This is a type of protein called a  monoclonal 
antibody . It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called  B-Lymphocyte . When 
rituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. </p>
<p>What Blitzima is used for 
Blitzima may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults and children. Your 
doctor may prescribe Blitzima for the treatment of: </p>
<p>a) 
Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma 
This is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell 
called B-Lymphocytes. 
In adults, Blitzima can be given alone or with other medicines called  chemotherapy . 
In adult patients where the treatment is working, Blitzima may be continued for 2 years after 
completing the initial treatment. 
In children and adolescents, Blitzima is given in combination with  chemotherapy . </p>
<p>b) 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects a 
particular lymphocyte, the B cell, which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph 
nodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone 
marrow and blood. The proliferation of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you 
may have. Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually 
removed from the body by biological processes. </p>
<p>c) 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis 
Blitzima is used for the treatment of adults and children 2 years of age and older with granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener s granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in 
combination with corticosteroids. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are 
two forms of inflammation of the blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may 
affect other organs as well. B-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. </p>
<p>d) 
Pemphigus vulgaris 
Blitzima is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus 
vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of the mouth, 
nose, throat and genitals. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.status = #additional
  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Blitzima if 
* you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
* you have a severe active infection at the moment 
* you have a weak immune system 
* you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. </p>
<p>Do not have Blitzima if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before you are given Blitzima. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Blitzima if: </p>
<ul>
<li>you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, 
Blitzima could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. 
Patients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for 
signs of this infection. </li>
<li>you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing 
problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Blitzima. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with 
Blitzima. </p>
<p>If you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris 
also tell your doctor 
* if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected 
by Blitzima help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you 
are given Blitzima. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or suffer 
from severe infections. 
* if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to 
travel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Blitzima or in 
the months after you receive Blitzima. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines 
before you receive Blitzima. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Non-Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Blitzima can be used for the treatment of children and adolescents, 6 months of age and older, with 
non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, specifically CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 
Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like 
lymphoma (BLL). 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are 
under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis 
Blitzima can be used for treatment of children and adolescents, 2 years of age and older, with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener s granulomatosis) or microscopic 
polyangiitis. There is not much information about the use of Blitzima in children and adolescents with 
other diseases. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are 
under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Blitzima 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Blitzima can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect 
the way Blitzima works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor: 
* if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other 
medicines 12 hours before you are given Blitzima. This is because some people have a fall in 
their blood pressure while they are being given Blitzima. 
* if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system   such as chemotherapy or 
immune-suppressive medicines. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Blitzima. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are 
planning to become pregnant. This is because Blitzima can across the placenta and may affect 
your baby. </p>
<p>If you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception 
while using Blitzima. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with 
Blitzima. </p>
<p>Blitzima passes into breast milk in very small amounts. As the long-term effects on breastfed infants 
are not known, for precautionary reasons, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with 
Blitzima and for 6 months after the treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Rituximab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>Blitzima contains sodium 
This medicine contains 52.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10 mL vial 
and 263.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 50 mL vial.<br />
This is equivalent to 2.6% (for 10 mL vial) and 13.2% (for 50 mL vial) of the recommended maximum 
daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>How Blitzima is given 
Blitzima will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. 
They will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any 
side effects. 
You will always be given Blitzima as a drip (intravenous infusion). </p>
<p>Medicines given before each Blitzima administration 
Before you are given Blitzima, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or 
reduce possible side effects. </p>
<p>How much and how often you will receive your treatment 
a) 
If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma 
* If you are having Blitzima alone 
Blitzima will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses with 
Blitzima are possible. 
* If you are having Blitzima with chemotherapy 
Blitzima will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given 
every 3 weeks up to 8 times. 
* If you respond well to treatment, you may be given Blitzima every 2 or 3 months for two 
years. Your doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. 
* If you are less than 18 years of age, you will be given Blitzima with chemotherapy. You will 
receive Blitzima up to 6 times over a 3.5   5.5 month period. </p>
<p>b) 
If you are being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
When you are treated with Blitzima in combination with chemotherapy, you will receive Blitzima 
infusions on day 0 cycle 1 then day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles in total. Each cycle has a duration of 
28 days. The chemotherapy should be given after the Blitzima infusion. Your doctor will decide if 
you should receive concomitant supportive therapy. </p>
<p>c) 
If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis<br />
Treatment with Blitzima uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will 
usually be given by injection before the start of Blitzima treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth 
may be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. If you are 18 years of age and 
older and respond well to treatment, you may be given Blitzima as a maintenance treatment. This 
will be administered as 2 separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart, followed by 1 infusion 
every 6 months for at least 2 years. Your doctor may decide to treat you longer with Blitzima (up to 
5 years), depending on how you respond to the medicine. </p>
<p>d) 
If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris 
Each course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. If you 
respond well to treatment, you may be given Blitzima as a maintenance treatment. This will be 
administered 1 year and 18 months after the initial treatment and then every 6 months as needed or 
your doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Most side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of 
these reactions have been fatal. </p>
<p>Infusion reactions 
During or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less 
frequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness 
(nausea), tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat 
discomfort, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart 
attack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get 
worse. Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you or your child develops any of 
these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require 
additional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or 
improve, the infusion can be continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second 
infusion. Your doctor may decide to stop your Blitzima treatment if these reactions are serious. </p>
<p>Infections 
Tell your doctor immediately if you or your child gets signs of an infection including: </p>
<ul>
<li>fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell </li>
