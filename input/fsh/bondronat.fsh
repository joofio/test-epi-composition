<p>Bondronat is used in adults and prescribed to you if you have breast cancer that has spread to your 
bones (called ‘bone‘metastases’).<br />
* It helps to prevent your bones from breaking (fractures) 
* It helps to prevent other bone problems that may need surgery or radiotherapy.   </p>
<p>Bondronat can also be prescribed if you have a raised calcium level in your blood due to a tumour. </p>
<p>Bondronat works by reducing the amount of calcium that is lost from your bones. This helps to stop 
your bones from getting weaker.  </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine that are 
listed in section 6 
* if you have, or have ever had low levels of calcium in your blood. </p>
<p>Do not receive this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor 
or pharmacist before having Bondronat. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very 
rarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving Bondronat for cancer-related conditions.  ONJ 
can also occur after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>It is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to 
treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions 
you should take. </p>
<p>Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: 
* you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction 
* you don’t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time 
* you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems) 
* you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) 
* you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) 
* you have cancer.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Bondronat.  </p>
<p>While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and 
receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you 
are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor 
about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Bondronat.  </p>
<p>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Bondronat: 
* if you are allergic to any other bisphosphonates 
* if you have high or low levels of vitamin D, calcium or any other minerals 
* if you have kidney problems 
* if you have heart problems and the doctor recommended to limit your daily fluid intake. </p>
<p>Cases of serious, sometimes fatal allergic reaction have been reported in patients treated with 
intravenous ibandronic acid. 
If you experience one of the following symptoms, such as shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, 
tight feeling in throat, swelling of tongue, dizziness, feeling of loss of consciousness, redness or 
swelling of face, body rash, nausea and vomiting, you should immediately alert your doctor or nurse 
(see section 4). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Bondronat should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Bondronat 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Bondronat can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some 
other medicines can affect the way Bondronat works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are receiving a type of antibiotic injection called 
‘aminoglycoside’ such as gentamicin. This is because aminoglycosides and Bondronat can both lower 
the amount of calcium in your blood.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not receive Bondronat if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or if you are breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You can drive and use machines as it’s expected that Bondronat has no or negligible effect on your 
ability to drive and use machines. Talk to your doctor first if you want to drive, use machines or tools.  </p>
<p>Bondronat contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. ‘essentially sodium free’. </p>         </div>"""

* Bondronat is normally given by a doctor or other medical staff who have experience with the 
treatment of cancer

<p>Your doctor may do regular blood tests while you are receiving Bondronat. This is to check that you 
are being given the right amount of this medicine.  </p>
<p>How much to receive 
Your doctor will work out how much Bondronat you will be given depending on your illness.<br />
If you have breast cancer that has spread to your bones, then the recommended dose is 3 vials (6 mg) 
every 3-4 weeks, as an infusion in your vein over at least 15 minutes. </p>
<p>If you have a raised calcium level in your blood due to a tumour then the recommended dose is a 
single administration of 1 vial (2 mg) or 2 vials (4 mg), depending on the severity of your illness. The 
medicine should be administered as an infusion in your vein over two hours. A repeated dose may be 
considered in case of insufficient response or if your illness reappears. </p>
<p>Your doctor may adjust your dose and duration of intravenous infusion if you have kidney problems. </p>
