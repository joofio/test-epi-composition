  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Bonviva belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates. It contains the active substance 
ibandronic acid. Bonviva may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone 
mass in most women who take it, even though they won t be able to see or feel a difference. Bonviva 
may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). This reduction in fractures was shown for 
the spine but not for the hip. </p>
<p>Bonviva is prescribed to you to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis because you have an 
increased risk of fractures. Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones, which is common 
in women after the menopause. At the menopause, a woman s ovaries stop producing the female 
hormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep her skeleton healthy. </p>
<p>The earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater her risk of fractures in osteoporosis.  </p>
<p>Other things that can increase the risk of fractures include: 
* not enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet 
* smoking, or drinking too much alcohol 
* not enough walking or other weight-bearing exercise 
* a family history of osteoporosis. </p>
<p>A healthy lifestyle will also help you to get the most benefit from your treatment. This includes:<br />
<em> eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D<br />
</em> walking or any other weight-bearing exercise<br />
* not smoking; and not drinking too much alcohol. </p>         </div>"""

* If you are allergic to ibandronic acid, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in 
section 6. * If you have certain problems with your gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) such as narrowing or 
difficulty swallowing. 
* If you can t stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time. 
* If you have, or had in the past low blood calcium. Please consult your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very 
rarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving Bonviva for osteoporosis.  ONJ can also occur 
after stopping treatment.  </p>
<p>It is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to 
treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions 
you should take. </p>
<p>Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: 
* you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction 
* you don t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time 
* you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems) 
* you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) 
* you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) 
* you have cancer. </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Bonviva. </p>
<p>While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and 
receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you 
are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor 
about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Bonviva. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Some people need to be especially careful while they re taking Bonviva. Talk to your doctor before 
taking Bonviva: 
* If you have any disturbances of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency).<br />
* If your kidneys are not functioning normally. 
* If you have any swallowing or digestive problems. </p>
<p>Irritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of 
severe pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting 
may occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of 
taking Bonviva. If you develop these symptoms, stop taking Bonviva and tell your doctor straight 
away (see section 3). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give Bonviva to children or adolescents below 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Bonviva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Especially: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium, as they could possibly 
influence the effects of Bonviva. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acetylsalicylic acid and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) (including 
ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium and naproxen) may irritate the stomach and intestine. Bonviva 
may also do so. So be especially careful if you take painkillers or anti-inflammatories while 
you re taking Bonviva.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After swallowing your monthly Bonviva tablet, wait for 1 hour before taking any other medication, 
including indigestion tablets, calcium supplements, or vitamins. </p>
<p>Bonviva with food and drink: 
Do not take Bonviva with food. Bonviva is less effective if it s taken with food. 
You can drink water but no other drinks  </p>
<p>After you have taken Bonviva, please wait for 1 hour before you can have your first food and further 
drinks. (see </p>         </div>"""

<p>The usual dose of Bonviva is one tablet once a month. </p>
<p>Taking your monthly tablet

date (such as the 1st of each month) or the same day (such as the first Sunday of each month) to

</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not take your tablet with water with a high concentration of calcium, fruit juice or any other

If you ve taken more than one tablet by mistake, drink a full glass of milk and talk to your doctor

in the day.<br />

scheduled dose is due and take it as normal; then, continue taking one tablet once a month on 
the scheduled days you ve marked on your calendar.  </p>
<p>If you forgot to take your tablet on your chosen day and your next scheduled dose is more 
than 7 days away <br />
