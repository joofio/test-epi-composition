cell transplantation you will receive bortezomib intravenously together with two other medicines; 
melphalan and prednisone. 
In this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles 
(54 weeks).

Preparation of the 1 mg vial: carefully add 1 ml of sterile, 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium 
chloride solution for injection to the vial containing the bortezomib by using a syringe of the 
appropriate size without removing the vial stopper. Dissolution of the lyophilised powder is 
completed in less than 2 minutes.  </p>
<p>The concentration of the resulting solution will be 1 mg/ml. The solution will be clear and 
colourless, with a final pH of 4 to 7. You do not need to check the pH of the solution.  </p>
<p>1.2 
Before administration, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discolouration. 
If any discolouration or particulate matter is observed, the solution must be discarded 
Confirm concentration on vial to ensure that the correct dose is being given for the 
intravenous route of administration (1 mg/ml). </p>
<p>1.3 
The chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution has been 
demonstrated at concentrations of 1 mg/ml  for 96 hours at 25 C and 8 days at 2-8 C, when 
stored in the original vial and/or a syringe.  </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution should be used immediately 
after preparation. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use 
are the responsibility of the user. The total storage time for the reconstituted medicinal 
product should not exceed 96 hours (if stored at 25 C) and 8 days (if stored at 2-8  C) prior
