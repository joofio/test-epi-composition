  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Bretaris Genuair is 
The active ingredient of Bretaris Genuair is aclidinium bromide, which belongs to a group of 
medicines called bronchodilators. Bronchodilators relax airways and help keep bronchioles open. 
Bretaris Genuair is a dry powder inhaler that uses your breath to deliver the medicine directly into 
your lungs. This makes it easier for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients to breathe. </p>
<p>What Bretaris Genuair is used for 
Bretaris Genuair is indicated to help open the airways and relieve symptoms of COPD, a serious, long-
term lung disease characterised by breathing difficulties. Regular use of Bretaris Genuair can help you 
when you have ongoing shortness of breath related to your disease to help you minimise the effects of 
the disease on your everyday life and reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD 
symptoms for several days). </p>         </div>"""
