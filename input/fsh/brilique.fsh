Brilique contains an active substance called ticagrelor. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
antiplatelet medicines.
What Brilique is used for
Brilique in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (another antiplatelet agent) is to be used in adults 
only. You have been given this medicine because you have had:</p>
<p>a heart attack, over a year ago.
It reduces the chances of you having another heart attack, stroke or dying from a disease related to 
your heart or blood vessels.
How Brilique works
Brilique affects cells called  platelets  (also called thrombocytes). These very small blood cells help 
stop bleeding by clumping together to plug tiny holes in blood vessels that are cut or damaged. 
However, platelets can also form clots inside diseased blood vessels in the heart and brain. This can be 
very dangerous because:</p>
<p>the clot can cut off the blood supply completely; this can cause a heart attack (myocardial 
infarction) or stroke, or</p>
<p>the clot can partly block the blood vessels to the heart; this reduces the blood flow to the heart 
and can cause chest pain which comes and goes (called  unstable angina ).
Brilique helps stop the clumping of platelets. This reduces the chance of a blood clot forming that can 
reduce blood flow.</p>         </div>"""

<p>You are allergic to ticagrelor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).</p>
<p>You are bleeding now.</p>
<p>You have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain.</p>
<p>You have severe liver disease.</p>
<p>You are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections) </li>
<li>clarithromycin (used to treat bacterial infections) </li>
<li>nefazodone (an antidepressant) </li>
<li>ritonavir and atazanavir (used to treat HIV infection and AIDS)
Do not take Brilique if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Brilique if:</li>
</ul>
<p>You have an increased risk of bleeding because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a recent serious injury</li>
<li>recent surgery (including dental work, ask your dentist about this)</li>
<li>you have a condition that affects blood clotting</li>
<li>recent bleeding from your stomach or gut (such as a stomach ulcer or colon  polyps )</li>
</ul>
<p>You are due to have surgery (including dental work) at any time while taking Brilique. This is 
because of the increased risk of bleeding. Your doctor may want you to stop taking this 
medicine 5 days prior to surgery.
  Your heart rate is abnormally low (usually lower than 60 beats per minute) and you do not 
already have in place a device that paces your heart (pacemaker).
  You have asthma or other lung problems or breathing difficulties.
  You develop irregular breathing patterns such as speeding up, slowing down or short pauses in
breathing. Your doctor will decide if you need further evaluation.
  You have had any problems with your liver or have previously had any disease which may have 
affected your liver.
  You have had a blood test that showed more than the usual amount of uric acid.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
this medicine.
If you are taking both Brilique and heparin:
  Your doctor may require a sample of your blood for diagnostic tests if they suspect a rare 
platelet disorder caused by heparin. It is important that you inform your doctor that you are 
taking both Brilique and heparin, as Brilique may affect the diagnostic test.
Children and adolescents
Brilique is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and Brilique
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Brilique can affect the way some medicines work and some medicines can 
have an effect on Brilique.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<p>rosuvastatin (a medicine to treat high cholesterol)</p>
<p>more than 40 mg daily of either simvastatin or lovastatin (medicines used to treat high 
cholesterol)</p>
<p>rifampicin (an antibiotic) </p>
<p>phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (used to control seizures) </p>
<p>digoxin (used to treat heart failure) </p>
<p>cyclosporine (used to lessen your body s defenses) </p>
<p>quinidine and diltiazem (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms) </p>
<p>beta blockers and verapamil (used to treat high blood pressure)</p>
<p>morphine and other opioids (used to treat severe pain)
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that 
increase your risk of bleeding:</p>
<p>oral anticoagulants  often referred to as  blood thinners  which include warfarin.</p>
<p>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (abbreviated as NSAIDs) often taken as painkillers 
such as ibuprofen and naproxen.</p>
<p>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (abbreviated as SSRIs) taken as antidepressants such as 
paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram.</p>
<p>other medicines such as ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections), clarithromycin (used to 
treat bacterial infections), nefazodone (an antidepressant), ritonavir and atazanavir (used to treat 
HIV infection and AIDS), cisapride (used to treat heartburn), ergot alkaloids (used to treat 
migraines and headaches).
Also tell your doctor that because you are taking Brilique, you may have an increased risk of bleeding 
if your doctor gives you fibrinolytics, often called  clot dissolvers , such as streptokinase or alteplase.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
It is not recommended to use Brilique if you are pregnant or may become pregnant. Women should 
use appropriate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy while taking this medicine.
Talk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you are breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss 
with you the benefits and risks of taking Brilique during this time.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Brilique is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. If you feel dizzy or confused
while taking this medicine, be careful while driving or using machines.
