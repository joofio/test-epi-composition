as enzyme replacement therapies. It is used to treat patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 
(CLN2) disease, also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) deficiency. </p>
<p>People with CLN2 disease do not have any enzyme called TPP1 or they have too little of it and this 
causes a build-up of substances called lysosomal storage materials. In people with CLN2 disease, 
these materials build-up in certain parts of the body, mainly the brain. </p>
<p>How Brineura works 
This medicine replaces the missing enzyme, TPP1, which minimises the build-up of the lysosomal 
storage materials. This medicine works to slow the progression of the disease.  </p>         </div>"""

other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6), and the reactions continue to happen 
when cerliponse alfa is given again. 
- If you or your child has a device implanted to drain extra fluid from the brain. 
- If you or your child currently has signs of a device infection or problems with the device. Your 
doctor may decide to continue treatment once the device infection or problems are resolved.  </p>

<p>This medicine will be given by a doctor with knowledge of giving medicines by 
intracerebroventricular use (infusion into the fluid of the brain) in a hospital or clinic. </p>
<p>This medicine has not been given to patients younger than 1 year of age or older than 9 years of age

<li>birth to &lt; 6 months: 100 mg </li>
<li>6 months to &lt; 1 year: 150 mg </li>
<li>1 year to &lt; 2 years: 200 mg (first 4 doses), 300 mg (all other doses) </li>
<li>≥ 2 years: 300 mg </li>

<p>Your doctor may adjust you or your child’s dose or the amount of time the medicine is given if the 
infusion is not tolerated, there is an allergic reaction or there is a possible increase of pressure in the 
brain. </p>
<p>The medicine is slowly pumped through the implanted device. After the medicine has been given, a 
shorter infusion of a solution is given to flush Brineura out of the infusion equipment so that the full 
dose reaches the brain. The medicine and solution will be given over about 2 to 4 hours and 
30 minutes according to your or your child’s dose. Your doctor may lower the dose or the speed of the 
infusion based on your response during the treatment. </p>
<p>Your doctor may give you or your child medicines, such as antipyretics to reduce fever or 
antihistamines to treat allergic reactions before each treatment with this medicine to reduce side effects 
that can occur during or shortly after treatment. </p>
