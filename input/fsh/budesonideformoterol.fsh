formoterol fumarate dihydrate. </p>
<ul>
<li>Budesonide belongs to a group of medicines called ‘corticosteroids’ also known as ‘steroids’.  It 
works by reducing and preventing swelling and inflammation in your lungs and helps you to 
breathe more easily.  </li>
<li>Formoterol fumarate dihydrate belongs to a group of medicines called ‘long-acting β2 
adrenoceptor agonists’ or ‘bronchodilators’.  It works by relaxing the muscles in your airways. 
This will help to open the airways and help you to breathe more easily. </li>
</ul>
<p>Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated for use in adults 18 years of age and 
older only.<br />
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is NOT indicated for use in children 12 years of age 
and younger or adolescents 13 to 17 years of age.  </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD).  </p>
<p>Asthma 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. can be prescribed for asthma in two different ways. </p>
<p>a)  You may be prescribed two asthma inhalers: Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
together with a separate ‘reliever inhaler’ such as salbutamol. 
* Use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day.  This helps to prevent asthma 
symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use the ‘reliever inhaler’ when you get asthma symptoms, to make it easier to breathe again.  </p>
<p>b)  You may be prescribed Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. as your only asthma 
inhaler. 
* Use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day.  This helps to prevent asthma 
symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. when you need to take extra inhalations or puffs 
for relief of asthma symptoms, to make it easier to breathe again and if agreed with the doctor 
also to prevent asthma symptoms from happening (for example, when exercising or on exposure 
to allergens).  You do not need a separate inhaler for this.  </p>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
COPD is a long-term lung disease of the airways in the lungs, which is often caused by cigarette 
smoking.  Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest discomfort and coughing up mucus. 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. can also be used to treat the symptoms of severe COPD in 
adults.  </p>         </div>"""
