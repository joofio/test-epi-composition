</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before receiving Buvidal if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>asthma or other breathing problems </li>
<li>any liver disease such as hepatitis </li>
<li>severe kidney impairment </li>
<li>certain heart rhythm conditions (long QT syndrome or prolonged QT interval) </li>

life-threatening condition (see  Other medicines and Buvidal ) </li>
<li>if you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. </li>
</ul>
<p>Important things to be aware of 
- Breathing problems: Some people have died from very slow or shallow breathing caused by 
taking buprenorphine with other central nervous system depressants (substances that slow down 
some brain activity) such as benzodiazepines, alcohol or other opioids.<br />
- Drowsiness: This medicine may cause drowsiness especially when used with alcohol or other 
central nervous system depressants (substances that slow down some brain activity) such as 
benzodiazepines, other medicines that reduce anxiety or cause sleepiness, pregabalin or 
gabapentin. 
- Dependence: This medicine can cause dependence. 
- Liver damage: Liver damage can occur with buprenorphine, especially when it is misused. It 
can also occur because of viral infections (chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, anorexia (eating 
disorder) or use of other medicines which harm your liver. Your doctor may ask you to have 
regular blood tests to check your liver. Tell your doctor if you have any liver problems before 
you start treatment with Buvidal. 
- Withdrawal symptoms: This medicine can cause withdrawal symptoms if you take it less than 
6 hours after you use a short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, heroin) or less than 24 hours after 
you use a long-acting opioid such as methadone. 
- Blood pressure: This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to 
feel dizzy if you get up too quickly from sitting or lying down. 
- Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions: This medicine may mask pain and make it 
difficult to diagnose some diseases. Do not forget to tell your doctor that you are being treated 
with this medicine. 
- Sleep-related breathing disorders: Buvidal can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as 
sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in 
the blood). The symptoms can include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to 
shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you 
or another person observe these symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be 
considered by your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Buvidal is not for use in children below 16 years of age. You will be more closely monitored by your 
doctor if you are an adolescent (16-17 years old). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Buvidal </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Some medicines may increase the side effects of Buvidal and may cause very serious reactions.  </p>
<p>It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders). Taking too much of a 
benzodiazepine together with Buvidal may lead to death because both medicines can cause very 
slow and shallow breathing (respiratory depression). If you need a benzodiazepine, your doctor 
will prescribe the correct dose. </li>
<li>gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin) (used to treat epilepsy or neuropathic pain). 
Taking too much of a gabapentinoid may lead to death because both medicines can cause very 
slow and shallow breathing (respiratory depression). You must use the dose that your doctor has 
prescribed for you. </li>
<li>alcohol or medicines containing alcohol. Alcohol can worsen the sedative effect of this 
medicine. </li>
<li>other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such as 
anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions (fits) and pain. These medicines when taken together with 
Buvidal can slow down some brain activity and reduce alertness and how well you will drive 
and use machines. 
Examples of medicines that can make you feel sleepy or less alert include: </li>
<li>other opioids such as methadone, certain painkillers and cough medicines. These 
medicines may also increase the risk of opioid overdose </li>
<li>antidepressants (used to treat depression) </li>
<li>sedative antihistamines (used to treat allergic reactions) </li>
<li>barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) </li>
<li>certain anxiolytics (used to treat anxiety disorders) </li>
<li>antipsychotics (used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia) </li>
<li>clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure). </li>
<li>opioid painkillers. These medicines may not work properly when taken together with Buvidal 
and they may increase the risk of overdose. </li>
<li>naltrexone and nalmefene (used to treat addiction disorders) as they can stop Buvidal from 
working properly. You should not take them at the same time as this medicine. </li>
<li>certain antiretrovirals (used to treat HIV infection) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir as 
they may increase the effects of this medicine. </li>
<li>certain antifungal medicines (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole as they may increase the effects of this medicine. </li>
<li>macrolide antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) such as clarithromycin and 
erythromycin as they may increase the effects of this medicine. </li>
<li>certain antiepileptic medicines (used to treat epilepsy) such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine 
and phenytoin as they may decrease the effect of Buvidal. </li>
<li>rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis). Rifampicin may decrease the effect of Buvidal. </li>
<li>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (used to treat depression) such as phenelzine, isocarboxazid, 
iponiazid and tranylcypromine as they may increase the effects of this medicine. </li>
<li>anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, doxepine, or 
trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Buvidal and you may experience symptoms 
such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the muscles that control 
movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive sweating, tremor, exaggeration 
of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature above 38 C. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Buvidal with alcohol </p>
<p>Do not take alcohol while using Buvidal, (see section 2 warnings and precautions). Taking alcohol 
with this medicine may increase drowsiness and may increase the risk of breathing problems.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may become pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. The risks of using Buvidal in pregnant 
women are not known. Your doctor will help you decide if you should continue taking the medicine 
during pregnancy. 
Using this medicine during late pregnancy may cause drug withdrawal symptoms including breathing 
problems in your new-born baby. This may happen from several hours to several days after birth. </p>
<p>Check with your doctor before using Buvidal during breastfeeding as this medicine passes into breast 
milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Buvidal may make you sleepy and dizzy. This is more likely at the start of treatment and when your 
dose is being changed. These effects can be worse if you drink alcohol or take other sedative 
medicines. Do not drive, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know 
how this medicine affects you. </p>
<p>Buvidal contains alcohol </p>
<p>Buvidal 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg and 32 mg contain 95.7 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each mL (10% w/w). 
The amount in 1 dose of this medicine is equivalent to less than 2 mL beer or 1 mL wine. 
The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Buvidal 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg and 32 mg are given weekly. Buvidal 64 mg, 96 mg, 128 mg and 160 mg 
are given monthly. </p>
<p>Your doctor will determine the best dose for you. During your treatment, the doctor may adjust the 
dose, depending on how well the medicine works. </p>
<p>Starting treatment 
The first dose of Buvidal will be given to you when you show clear signs of withdrawal.<br />
If you are dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g. morphine or heroin), the first dose of Buvidal will be 
given to you at least 6 hours after you last used an opioid. 
If you are dependent on long-acting opioids (e.g. methadone), your dose of methadone will be reduced 
to below 30 mg per day before beginning with Buvidal. The first dose of this medicine will be given to 
you at least 24 hours after you last used methadone. </p>
<p>If you are not already receiving sublingual (under the tongue) buprenorphine (the same active 
substance as in Buvidal), the recommended starting dose is 16 mg, with one or two additional Buvidal 
8 mg doses given at least 1 day apart during the first treatment week. This means a target dose of 
24 mg or 32 mg during the first treatment week. 
If you have not used buprenorphine before you will receive a 4 mg sublingual buprenorphine dose and 
be observed for an hour before the first Buvidal dose. </p>
<p>Buvidal for monthly treatment can be used, if appropriate for you, once stabilisation has been achieved 
with Buvidal for weekly treatment (four weeks treatment or more, where practical).  </p>
<p>If you are already taking sublingual buprenorphine, you can start receiving Buvidal the day after your 
last treatment. Your doctor will prescribe the correct starting dose of Buvidal for you depending on the 
dose of sublingual buprenorphine you are now taking. </p>
<p>Continuing treatment and dose adjustment 
During continued treatment with Buvidal, your doctor may decrease or increase your dose according 
to your need. You may be switched from weekly and monthly treatment and from monthly to weekly 
treatment. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. 
During continued treatment, you might receive one additional Buvidal 8 mg dose between your 
weekly or monthly treatments if your doctor thinks this is appropriate for you. 
The maximum dose per week if you are on weekly Buvidal treatment is 32 mg with an additional 8 mg 
dose. The maximum dose per month if you are on monthly Buvidal treatment is 160 mg.  </p>
<p>Route of administration 
Buvidal is given as a single injection under the skin (subcutaneously) in any of the allowed injection 
areas buttock, thigh, abdomen or upper arm. You can receive several injections in the same injection 
area, but the exact injection sites will be different for each weekly and monthly injection for a 
minimum period of 8 weeks. </p>
<p>If you use more buprenorphine than you should </p>
<p>If you have received more buprenorphine than you should you need to contact your doctor 
immediately since this can cause very slow and shallow breathing which can lead to death.  </p>
<p>If you use too much buprenorphine, you must immediately seek medical attention as overdose may 
cause serious and life-threatening breathing problems. Symptoms of overdose may include breathing 
more slowly and weakly, feeling more sleepy than normal, feeling sick, vomiting and/or having 
slurred speech or difficulty talking. You may also have smaller pupils. If you start to feel faint, this 
may be a sign of low blood pressure. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Buvidal </p>
<p>It is very important to keep all your appointments to receive Buvidal. If you miss an appointment, ask 
your doctor when to schedule your next dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Buvidal </p>
<p>Do not stop treatment without checking with the doctor who is treating you. Stopping treatment may 
cause withdrawal symptoms. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
