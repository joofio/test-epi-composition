medicines.
BYANNLI is used as a maintenance treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia in adult patients.
If you have responded well to treatment with paliperidone palmitate injection given once a month or 
once every three months, your doctor may start treatment with BYANNLI.
Schizophrenia is a disease with  positive  and  negative  symptoms. Positive means an excess of 
symptoms that are not normally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may hear voices or 
see things that are not there (called hallucinations), believe things that are not true (called delusions), 
or feel unusually suspicious of others. Negative means a lack of behaviours or feelings that are 
normally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may appear withdrawn and may not 
respond at all emotionally or may have trouble speaking in a clear and logical way. People with this 
disease may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, or tense.
BYANNLI can help alleviate the symptoms of your disease and reduce the risk of your symptoms 
coming back.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using BYANNLI.
This medicine has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. However, elderly patients with 
dementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke 
or death (see section 4).
All medicines have side effects and some of the side effects of this medicine can worsen the symptoms 
of other medical conditions. For that reason, it is important to discuss with your doctor any of the 
following conditions which can potentially worsen during treatment with this medicine:
-
if you have Parkinson s disease
-
if you have a type of dementia called  Lewy body dementia 
-
if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high temperature 
and muscle stiffness (also known as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome)
-
if you have ever experienced twitching or jerking movements that you cannot control in your 
face, tongue, or other parts of your body (Tardive Dyskinesia)
-
if you know that you have had low levels of white blood cells in the past (which may or may not 
have been caused by other medicines)
-
if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes
-
if you have had breast cancer or a tumour in the pituitary gland in your brain
-
if you have a heart disease or heart disease treatment that makes you prone to low blood 
pressure
-
if you have low blood pressure when you stand up or sit up suddenly
-
if you have a history of seizures
-
if you have kidney problems
-
if you have liver problems
-
if you have prolonged and/or painful erection
-
if you have problems with controlling body temperature or overheating
-
if you have an abnormally high level of the hormone prolactin in your blood or if you have a 
possible prolactin-dependent tumour
-
if you or someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been 
associated with formation of blood clots.
If you have any of these conditions, please talk to your doctor as he/she may want to adjust your dose 
or monitor you for a while.
As dangerously low numbers of a certain type of white blood cell needed to fight infection in your 
blood has been seen very rarely with patients taking this medicine, your doctor may check your white 
blood cell counts.
Even if you have previously tolerated oral paliperidone or risperidone, rarely allergic reactions occur 
after receiving injections of BYANNLI. Seek medical attention right away if you experience a rash, 
swelling of your throat, itching, or problems breathing as these may be signs of a serious allergic 
reaction.
This medicine may cause you to gain or loose weight. Significant changes in weight may be bad for 
your health. Your doctor should regularly measure your body weight.
As diabetes mellitus or worsening of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been seen with patients taking 
this medicine, your doctor should check for signs of high blood sugar. In patients with pre-existing 
diabetes mellitus blood glucose should be monitored regularly.
Since this medicine may reduce your urge to vomit, there is a chance that it may mask the body s 
normal response to ingestion of toxic substances or other medical conditions.
Cataract operations
If you are planning to have an operation on your eye, make sure you tell your eye doctor that you are 
taking this medicine. This is because during a cataract operation on the eye for cloudiness of the lens:</p>
<p>the pupil (the black circle in the middle of your eye) may not increase in size as needed</p>
<p>the iris (the coloured part of the eye) may become floppy during surgery and that may lead to 
eye damage. 
Children and adolescents
Do not use this medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. It is not known if it is safe 
and effective in these patients.
Other medicines and BYANNLI
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Taking this medicine with carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic and mood stabiliser) may require a change 
to your dose of this medicine.
Since this medicine works primarily in the brain, using other medicines that work in the brain can 
cause an exaggeration of side effects such as sleepiness or other effects on the brain such as other 
psychiatric medicines, opioids, antihistamines and sleep medicines.
Tell your doctor if you take this medicine while you are also taking oral risperidone or paliperidone 
for extended periods of time. You may require a change to your dose of BYANNLI.
Since this medicine can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when this medicine is used with 
other medicines that lower blood pressure.
This medicine can reduce the effect of medicines against Parkinson s disease and restless legs 
syndrome (e.g., levodopa).
This medicine may cause an electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality demonstrating a long time for an 
electrical impulse to travel through a certain part of the heart (known as  QT prolongation ). Other 
medicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat the rhythm of the heart or to treat 
infection, and other antipsychotics.
If you have a history of seizures, this medicine may increase your risk of experiencing them. Other 
medicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat depression or to treat infection, 
and other antipsychotics.
BYANNLI should be used with caution with medicines that increase the activity of the central nervous 
system (psychostimulants such as methylphenidate).
BYANNLI with alcohol
Alcohol should be avoided.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Women of childbearing potential
A single dose of this medicine is expected to remain within the body for up to 4 years, which may be a 
risk for the baby. BYANNLI should, therefore, only be used in women planning to have a baby if 
clearly necessary.
Pregnancy
You should not use this medicine during pregnancy unless this has been discussed with your doctor. 
The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies of mothers that have used paliperidone in the 
last trimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, 
sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. Newborns should be monitored 
carefully and if your baby develops any of these symptoms seek medical attention for your baby.
Breast-feeding
This medicine can pass from mother to baby through breast milk. It may harm the baby, even a long 
time after the latest dose. Therefore, you should not breast-feed if you are using, or have used, this 
medicine in the past 4 years.
Driving and using machines
Dizziness, extreme tiredness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see 
section 4). This should be considered in cases where full alertness is required, e.g., when driving a car 
or handling machines.
BYANNLI contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

keep your appointment, make sure you call right away so another appointment can be made as soon as 
possible.
You will receive an injection of BYANNLI in the buttocks once every 6 months.
Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may increase or decrease the amount of medicine you 
receive at the time of your next scheduled injection.
Patients with kidney problems
If you have mild kidney problems your doctor will determine if BYANNLI is appropriate based on the 
dose of 1-monthly or 3-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable that you have been receiving. The 
1 000 mg dose of BYANNLI is not recommended.
If you have moderate or severe kidney problems this medicine should not be used.
Elderly
Your doctor may adjust your dose of this medicine if your kidney function is reduced.
If you are given more BYANNLI than needed
This medicine will be given to you under medical supervision; it is, therefore, unlikely that you will be 
given too much.
Patients who have been given too much paliperidone may experience the following symptoms:
drowsiness or sedation, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, an abnormal electrocardiogram (electrical 
tracing of the heart), or slow or abnormal movements of the face, body, arms or legs.
If you stop using BYANNLI
If you stop receiving your injections, your symptoms of schizophrenia may get worse. You should not 
stop using this medicine unless told to do so by your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
