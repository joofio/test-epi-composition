This medicine is used in combination with the following diabetes medicines: metformin, 
sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones (combination therapy with thiazolidinedione was only studied in 
adult patients), SGLT2 inhibitors and/or a long-acting insulin. Your doctor is now prescribing this 
medicine as an additional medicine to help control your blood sugar. Continue to follow your food and 
exercise plan.
You have diabetes because your body does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in 
your blood or your body is not able to use the insulin properly. This medicine helps your body to 
increase the production of insulin when your blood sugar is high. </p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse before using Bydureon about the following:
-
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Test your blood glucose levels regularly. Ask your doctor, 
pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure if any of your other medicines contain a 
sulphonylurea.
-
If you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as this medicine should not be used.
-
How to inject this medicine. It should be injected into the skin and not into a vein or into the 
muscle. 
-
If you have severe problems with your stomach emptying (including gastroparesis) or food 
digestion, as the use of this medicine is not recommended. The active substance in this medicine 
slows stomach emptying so food passes more slowly through your stomach.
-
If you have ever had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) (see section 4).
-
If you lose weight too quickly (more than 1.5 kg per week) talk to your doctor about it since this 
may cause problems such as gallstones.
-
If you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis, as the use of this medicine is not 
recommended.
Bydureon is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. 
Children and adolescents
Bydureon can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. There is no data available 
for use of this medicine in children below 10 years of age.
Other medicines and Bydureon
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, particularly:
-
other medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as medicines that work like 
Bydureon (for example: liraglutide or other exenatide containing products), as taking these 
medicines with Bydureon is not recommended.
-
medicines used to thin the blood (anticoagulants), e.g. Warfarin, as you will require additional 
monitoring of changes in INR (measurement of blood thinning) during initiation of therapy with 
this medicine.
-
a medicine that contains a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur when 
combined with Bydureon. 
-
if you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will 
recommend that you monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid 
hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that 
occurs when the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
It is not known if this medicine may harm your unborn child, therefore you should not use it during 
pregnancy and for at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.
It is not known if exenatide passes into your milk. You should not use this medicine while 
breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
You should use contraception if you could potentially become pregnant during treatment with this 
medicine.
Driving and using machines
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can
occur. Hypoglycaemia may reduce your ability to concentrate. Please keep this possible problem in 
mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or using 
machines).

with your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure.
You should inject this medicine once a week, at any time of day, with or without meals.
You should inject this medicine into the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area 
(abdomen), upper leg (thigh), or the back of your upper arm. Do not inject into a vein or muscle.
Each week you can use the same area of your body. Be sure to choose a different injection site in that 
area.
Never mix insulin and Bydureon together in the same injection. If you need to give yourself both at the 
same time, use two separate injections. You may give both injections in the same body area (for 
example, your stomach area), but you should not give the injections next to each other.
Test your blood glucose levels regularly, it is particularly important to do this if you are also using a 
sulphonylurea.
Follow the  Instructions for the User  provided in the carton to inject Bydureon
Your doctor or diabetes nurse should teach you how to inject this medicine before you use it for the 
first time.
Check that the liquid in the syringe is clear and free of particles before you begin. After mixing, use 
the suspension only if the mixture is white to off white and cloudy. If you see clumps of dry powder 
on the sides or bottom of the vial, the medicine is NOT mixed well. Shake vigorously again until well 
mixed.
You should inject this medicine immediately after mixing the powder and the solvent.
Use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it safely after each use as instructed by 
your doctor or diabetes nurse. 
If you use more Bydureon than you should
If you use more of this medicine than you should, please consult with your doctor first as you may 
need medical treatment. Using too much of this medicine can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or 
symptoms of low blood sugar (see section 4).
If you forget to use Bydureon
You might like to choose a day that you always plan to make your Bydureon injection. 
If you miss a dose and there are 3 days or more until your next dose is due, then take the missed dose 
as soon as it is possible to do so. For your next injection you can return to your chosen injection day. 
If you miss a dose and there are only 1 or 2 days until your next dose is due, skip the missed dose and 
take the next one as usual, on the day it is due. You can also change your chosen injection day, as long 
as your last dose was given 3 or more days before. 
Do not take two doses of Bydureon within 3 days of each other.
If you are not sure you have taken the full dose of Bydureon
If you are not sure if you have taken all of your dose, do not inject another dose of this medicine, just 
take it next week as planned.
If you stop using Bydureon
If you feel you should stop using this medicine, please consult your doctor first. If you stop using this 
medicine this can affect your blood sugar levels. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes 
nurse.</p>         </div>"""
