Byetta is used with other diabetic medicines called metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones and 
basal or long acting insulins. Your doctor is now prescribing Byetta as an additional medicine to help 
control your blood sugar. Continue to follow your food and exercise plan.
You have diabetes because your body does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in 
your blood or if your body is not able to use the insulin properly. The medicine in Byetta helps your 
body to increase the production of insulin when your blood sugar is high. </p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse before using Byetta about the following:
-
Using this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
can occur. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure if any of your other 
medicines contain a sulphonylurea.
-
If you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (a dangerous condition that can occur in 
diabetes), as you should not use this medicine.
-
How to inject this medicine. It should be injected under the skin and not into a vein or into the 
muscle. 
-
If you have severe problems with slow stomach emptying or food digestion, as the use of this 
medicine is not recommended. The active substance in this medicine slows stomach emptying so 
food passes more slowly through your stomach.
-
If you have ever had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) (see section 4).
-
If you lose weight too quickly (more than 1.5 kg per week) talk to your doctor about it since this 
may cause problems such as gallstones.
-
If you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis, as the use of this medicine is not 
recommended. There is little experience with this medicine in patients with kidney problems
Byetta is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. 
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents less than 18 years as there is no experience with 
this medicine in this age group.
Other medicines and Byetta
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, particularly:
-
medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes that work like Byetta (e.g. liraglutide and 
prolonged-release exenatide), as taking these medicines with Byetta is not recommended.
-
medicines used to thin the blood (anticoagulants), e.g. warfarin, as you will require additional 
monitoring of changes in INR (measurement of blood thinning) during initiation of therapy with 
this medicine.
Ask your doctor if the time at which you take any tablets should be changed because this medicine 
slows stomach emptying and can affect medicines that need to pass through the stomach quickly, e.g.
-
Stomach resistant tablets or capsules (e.g. medicines that reduce stomach acid (proton pump 
inhibitors)) that should not stay too long in your stomach, may need to be taken an hour before,
or four hours after this medicine.
-
Some antibiotics may need to be taken an hour before your Byetta injection.
-
For tablets that you need to take with food, it may be best if they are taken at a meal at a time 
when this medicine is not being administered.
Byetta with food
Use this medicine at any time within the 60 minutes (1 hour) before your meal. (See section 3  How 
to use Byetta ). Do not use this medicine after your meal.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
It is not known if this medicine may harm your unborn child. If you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine, as it should not be used during pregnancy.
It is not known if exenatide passes into your milk. This medicine should not be used if breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Hypoglycaemia may reduce your ability to concentrate. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines).
Byetta contains metacresol
Metacresol may cause allergic reactions.
Byetta contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially  sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

with your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure.
Two strengths of Byetta are available: Byetta 5 micrograms and Byetta 10 micrograms. Your doctor 
may tell you to use Byetta 5 micrograms twice a day to start with. After using Byetta 5 micrograms 
twice a day for 30 days the doctor may increase your dose to Byetta 10 micrograms twice a day. 
If you are over 70 years old or have problems with your kidneys it may take longer than 30 days to 
tolerate the Byetta 5 micrograms dose and so your doctor may not increase your dose. 
One injection of your pre-filled pen will give you your dose. Do not change your dose unless your 
doctor has told you to.
You should inject this medicine at any time within the 60 minutes (1 hour) before your morning and 
evening meals, or before your two main meals of the day, which should be about 6 hours or more
apart. Do not use this medicine after your meal.
You should inject this medicine under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your upper leg (thigh),
stomach area (abdomen), or upper arm. If you are using Byetta and an insulin you must make two 
separate injections.
You will not need to test your sugar levels on a day-by-day basis to set the dose of Byetta. However, if 
you are also using a sulphonylurea or an insulin your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar 
levels to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin. If you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you 
how to reduce the dose of insulin and will recommend that you monitor your blood sugar more 
frequently, in order to avoid hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a 
complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable to break down glucose because there is 
not enough insulin).
See the accompanying Pen User Manual for instructions for using the Byetta Pen.
Your doctor or nurse must teach you how to inject Byetta before you use it for the first time.
Becton, Dickinson and Company needles are suitable to use with the Byetta pen. Injection needles are 
not included. 
Use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it after each use. This medicine is for you; 
never share a Byetta pen with others.
If you use more Byetta than you should
If you use more of this medicine than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital right away. Using 
too much of this medicine can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or symptoms of low blood sugar (see 
section 4).
If you forget to use Byetta
If you miss a dose of this medicine, skip that dose and use your next dose at the next prescribed time. 
Do not use an extra dose or increase the amount of your next dose to make up for the one you missed. 
If you stop using Byetta
If you feel you should stop using this medicine, consult your doctor first. If you stop using this 
medicine this can affect your blood sugar levels.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes 
nurse.</p>         </div>"""
