particular if:<br />

or medicines for use in drug substitution therapy)

- certain antihistamines (medicines to treat allergies)

<p>It is important to tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking other medicines, as using more than one at 
the same time can change the effect of the medicines involved. </p>
<p>Byfavo with alcohol 
Alcohol can change the effect of Byfavo. Tell your doctor or nurse: 
- how much alcohol you drink regularly or if you have had problems with alcohol use; </p>
<p>Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours before you are given Byfavo. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding

nurse if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.<br />
If you are a breastfeeding mother, do not breastfeed for 24 hours after you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Byfavo makes you sleepy, forgetful and affects your ability to concentrate. Even though these effects 
wear off rapidly, you must not drive and operate machinery until these effects are completely gone. 
Ask your doctor about when you can drive or operate machinery again. </p>
<p>Byfavo contains dextran 40 for injection<br />
This medicine contains 79.13 mg of dextran 40 for injection in each vial. Rarely, dextrans can cause 
severe allergic reactions. If you have breathing difficulty or swelling or you feel faint, get medical help 
at once.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Read the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) carefully before use.  </p>
<p>Remimazolam must only be administered by health care professionals experienced in sedation. The 
patient should be monitored throughout by a separate healthcare professional, who is not involved in 
the conduct of the procedure, and whose sole task is to monitor the patient. All personnel must be 
trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation and apnoea, including 
the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation and cardiovascular resuscitation. The 
patientÂ´s respiratory and cardiac function must be continuously monitored. Resuscitative medicinal 
products and age- and size-appropriate equipment for restoring airway patency and bag/valve/mask 
ventilation must be immediately available. A benzodiazepine antagonist (flumazenil, a medicine for 
counteracting the effects of remimazolam) must be immediately available for use.  </p>
<p>Reconstitution instructions </p>
<p>Note: Strict aseptic techniques must be mainted during handling, preparation and use of Byfavo. </p>
<p>To reconstitute, use a sterile needle and a 10 mL sterile syringe, remove the vial cap, puncture the vial 
stopper at an angle of 90Â° and add 8.2 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, 
directing the stream of saline toward the wall of the vial. Gently swirl the vial until the contents are 
fully dissolved. The reconstituted solution should be clear and colourless to light yellow. The vial 
delivers a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL of remimazolam.  </p>
<p>The reconstituted solution must be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. If particles or discolouration are present then the solution should be discarded.  </p>
<p>The reconsituted solution is for single use only, any unused portion must be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements.  </p>
<p>Incompatibilities </p>
<p>Byfavo is incompatible with Lactated Ringerâs Solution (also known as Compound Sodium Lactate 
Solution or Hartmannâs Solution), Acetated Ringerâs Solution, and Bicarbonated Ringerâs Solution for 
infusion.  </p>
<p>After reconstitution, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except 
those mentioned below. </p>
<p>Compatibilities </p>
<p>Reconstituted Byfavo has been shown to be compatible with the following i.v. fluids when 
administered through the same i.v. line: 
- Glucose (5%) solution for injection 
- Glucose (20%) solution for injection 
- Glucose (5%) - sodium chloride (0.45%) solution for injection 
- Ringers Solution 
- Sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection 
Compatibility with other i.v. fluids has not been evaluated.  </p>
<p>Shelf life </p>
<p>Chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 20Â°C to 25Â°C.  </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view , unless the method of opening/reconstitution/dilution precludes 
the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.  </p>
<p>Special precautions for storage </p>
<p>Keep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light. </p>
