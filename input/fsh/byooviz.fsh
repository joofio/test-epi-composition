  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Byooviz is 
Byooviz is a solution which is injected into the eye. Byooviz belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab. </p>
<p>What Byooviz is used for 
Byooviz is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment. </p>
<p>These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels. This is observed in diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, a disease caused by 
diabetes). It may also be associated with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic 
myopia (PM), angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy or inflammatory CNV. </li>
<li>Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused by diabetes 
(a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of retinal veins of the 
retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)). </li>
</ul>
<p>How Byooviz works 
Byooviz specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth factor 
A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and swelling 
in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like AMD, DME, PDR, RVO, PM and 
CNV. By binding to VEGF-A, Byooviz can block its actions and prevent this abnormal growth and 
swelling. </p>
<p>In these diseases, Byooviz can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You must not receive Byooviz 
- If you are allergic to ranibizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have an infection in or around your eye. 
- If you have pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in your eye. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Byooviz. 
- Byooviz is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion of 
the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of the 
eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or clouding of 
the lens (cataract) may occur after Byooviz treatment. It is important to identify and treat such an 
infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell your doctor immediately if you 
develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or 
decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision or increased sensitivity to 
light. 
- In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
This is something you may not notice, therefore your doctor may monitor this after each 
injection. 
- Inform your doctor if you have a prior history of eye conditions or eye treatments, or if you 
have had a stroke or experienced transient signs of stroke (weakness or paralysis of limbs or 
face, difficulty speaking or understanding). This information will be taken into account to 
evaluate if Byooviz is the appropriate treatment for you. </p>
<p>Please see section 4 ( Possible side effects ) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Byooviz therapy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) 
The use of Byooviz in children and adolescents has not been established and is therefore not 
recommended.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Byooviz 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least three further months after the last injection of Byooviz. 
- There is no experience of using Byooviz in pregnant women. Byooviz should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you are 
pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your 
doctor before treatment with Byooviz. 
- Small amounts of ranibizumab  may pass into breast milk, therefore Byooviz is not 
recommended during breast-feeding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before Byooviz 
treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
After Byooviz treatment you may experience some temporary vision blurring. If this happens, do not 
drive or use machines until this resolves. </p>         </div>"""

administered by your eye doctor. </p>
<p>Before the injection, your doctor will wash your eye carefully to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection. </p>
<p>The treatment is started with one injection of Byooviz per month. Your doctor will monitor the 
condition of your eye and, depending on how you respond to the treatment, will decide if and when 
you need to receive further treatment. </p>

<p>Elderly (age 65 years and over)

with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Byooviz. </p>
