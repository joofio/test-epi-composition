thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in adults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older 
weighing at least 40 kg. This is a rare blood clotting disorder in which clots form in small blood 
vessels. These clots can block blood vessels and damage the brain, heart, kidneys, or other organs. 
Cablivi prevents the formation of these blood clots by stopping platelets in the blood from clumping 
together. By doing so, Cablivi reduces the risk of experiencing another episode of aTTP soon after the 
first.  </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Treatment with Cablivi is started by a doctor experienced in blood disorders.  </p>
<p>The recommended treatment is 
* first dose 
- 1 vial injected into a vein by a healthcare professional<br />
- the medicine will be given before starting plasma exchange. </p>
<ul>
<li>subsequent doses </li>
<li>1 vial once daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin of the belly)  </li>
<li>the subcutaneous injection will be given after each daily plasma exchange   </li>
<li>after the daily plasma exchange finishes, your treatment with Cablivi will continue for at least 
30 days with injection of 1 vial once daily  </li>
<li>your doctor may ask you to continue daily treatment until the underlying signs of your disease 
are resolved. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may decide that you or your caregiver may inject Cablivi. In this case, your doctor or 
healthcare provider will train you or your caregiver on how to use Cablivi. </p>
<p>Instructions for use<br />
The first injection of Cablivi into your vein must be given by a healthcare professional. Instructions 
for healthcare professionals on how to inject Cablivi into your vein are at the end of the leaflet. </p>
<p>For each injection, use a fresh kit package to prepare the injection solution. Do not try to inject Cablivi 
until you have been taught how to do so by a healthcare professional. Never use the kit for another 
injection. </p>
<p>Step 1 - Cleaning<br />
* Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 
* Prepare a clean flat surface for placing the kit package. 
* Make sure you have a disposal container at hand. </p>
<p>Step 2 - Before use<br />
<em> Make sure the kit package is complete. 
* Check the expiry date. Do not use if the expiry date has passed.<br />
</em> Do not use the kit if the packaging or the items in it are damaged in any way. 
* Place all components of the kit on the clean flat surface.<br />
* If the kit was not stored at room temperature, allow the vial and the syringe to reach room 
temperature (15°C – 25°C) by letting them stand at room temperature for a few minutes. Do not 
warm them up in any other way. </p>
<p>Step 3 - Disinfect the rubber stopper<br />
* Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the vial. Do not use the vial if the green plastic cap is 
missing. 
* Clean the exposed rubber stopper using one of the alcohol pads provided and allow it to dry for 
a few seconds. 
* After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any surface.  </p>
<p>Step 4 - Attaching the adapter<br />
* Take the packed vial adapter and remove the paper cover. Leave the adapter in its opened 
plastic packaging. Do not touch the adapter itself.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Place the adapter over the vial, while keeping the adapter in its plastic packaging. </li>
<li>Press down firmly until the adapter snaps into place, with the adapter spike going through the 
vial stopper. Leave the adapter attached to the vial, still in its outer packaging. </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 5 - Prepare the syringe<br />
<em> Holding the syringe in your hand, break off the white cap with your other hand.<br />
</em> Do not use the syringe if this white cap is missing, loose or damaged. </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to come into contact with any surfaces. </li>
<li>Place the syringe on the clean flat surface.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 6 - Connect syringe with adapter and vial<br />
* Take the vial with the attached adapter. 
* Remove the plastic packaging from the adapter by holding the vial with one hand, pressing the 
sides of the adapter packaging with your other hand, and then lifting the packaging upwards. 
Take care that the adapter does not come away from the vial. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the adapter with the attached vial with one hand. Place the tip of the syringe on the 
connector part of the vial adapter.  </li>
<li>Gently lock the syringe onto the vial by turning it clockwise until resistance is felt. </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 7 - Prepare the solution<br />
* Keep the vial standing vertically on the surface with the syringe pointing downwards. 
* Slowly push the syringe’s plunger down until the syringe is empty. Do not remove the syringe 
from the vial. 
* With the syringe still connected to the vial adapter, gently swirl the vial with connected syringe 
until the powder is dissolved. Avoid foaming. Do not shake the vial. </p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the vial with connected syringe to stand on the surface for 5 minutes at room temperature 
to allow the solution to completely dissolve. The plunger may rise up by itself again - this is 
normal.  </li>
<li>Go to step 8 immediately after these 5 minutes. </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 8 - Draw up solution<br />
<em> Check the solution for particles. All powder must be dissolved and the solution must be clear. 
* Slowly press the syringe’s plunger fully down.<br />
</em> Turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - upside down. 
* While keeping it vertical, slowly pull the plunger to transfer all the solution into the syringe. Do 
not shake it. </p>
<p>Step 9 - Prepare the syringe for administration  </p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the whole - vial, adapter and syringe - right-side up (with the syringe at the top). 
Disconnect the filled syringe from the adapter by holding the adapter in one hand and gently 
turning the syringe counter-clockwise. </li>
<li>Put the vial and the attached adapter into the supplied disposal container. </li>
<li>Do not touch the syringe tip or allow it to touch the surface. Place the syringe on the clean flat 
surface. </li>
<li>Go to step 10 to inject caplacizumab under the skin of the belly. Instructions for healthcare 
professionals on how to inject Cablivi into your vein are at the end of the leaflet. </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 10 - Attach the needle<br />
* Unpack the needle by tearing the paper cover off the needle packaging and removing the needle 
with protective cap.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Without removing the needle cap, attach the needle to the syringe by turning clockwise until 
resistance is felt.  </li>
<li>Pull back the needle safety shield. </li>
<li>Check the content of the syringe. Do not use the medicine if you see any cloudiness, clumps 
or anything else that looks abnormal. Contact your doctor or nurse if this happens. </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 11 - Prepare injection site for injection under the skin  </p>
<ul>
<li>Select a suitable place (‘injection site’) on your belly for injection under your skin. Avoid the 
area around the belly button. Select a different injection site from the one you used on the 
previous day to help the skin to recover after the injection.' </li>
<li>Use the second alcohol pad to clean the injection site you have chosen. </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 12 - Administration<br />
* Carefully remove the needle protection cap from the needle and throw it away. Make sure the 
needle does not touch anything before the injection. 
* Hold the syringe at eye level with the needle pointing upwards. 
* Remove any air bubbles by tapping the side of the syringe with your finger to make the bubbles 
rise towards the tip. Then, slowly push the plunger until a small amount of liquid comes out of 
the needle. 
* Gently pinch the cleaned skin between your thumb and forefinger to make a fold.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Hold this skin fold during the entire injection. </li>
<li>Insert the full length of the needle into the skin fold at an angle as shown in the illustration. </li>
<li>
<p>Press the plunger down as far as it goes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull out the needle at the same angle you inserted it. Do not rub the injection site. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 13 - After administration<br />
* Immediately after the injection, move the needle safety shield over the needle, until it clicks into 
place. </p>
<ul>
<li>Put the syringe with the needle in a disposal container. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more Cablivi than you should 
An overdose is unlikely since one vial contains only a single dose. Tell your doctor if you think you 
have had an overdose.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Cablivi 
If you miss a dose you should still take it if it is within 12 hours of the scheduled time. If more than hours have passed since the dose should have been given, do not take the missed dose, but inject the 
next dose at the usual time. </p>
<p>If you stop using Cablivi 
To get the most benefit from your treatment, it is important to use Cablivi as prescribed and for as long 
as your doctor tells you to use it. Please talk to your doctor before you stop the treatment because 
stopping it too early can cause your condition to come back. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
