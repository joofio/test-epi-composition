<p>CABOMETYX is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance cabozantinib.<br />
It is used in adults to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>advanced kidney cancer called advanced renal cell carcinoma  </li>
<li>liver cancer when a specific anticancer medicine (sorafenib) is no longer stopping the disease 
from progressing.  </li>
</ul>
<p>CABOMETYX is also used to treat locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer, a 
type of cancer in the thyroid gland, in adults when radioactive iodine and anticancer medicine 
treatments are no longer stopping the disease from progressing. </p>
<p>CABOMETYX may be given in combination with nivolumab for advanced kidney cancer. It is 
important that you also read the package leaflet of nivolumab. If you have any questions about these 
medicines, please ask your doctor. </p>
<p>How CABOMETYX works </p>
<p>CABOMETYX blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are 
involved in the growth of cells and the development of new blood vessels that supply them. These 
proteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action this medicine can 
slow down the rate at which the tumour grows and help to cut off the blood supply that the cancer 
needs.  </p>         </div>"""
