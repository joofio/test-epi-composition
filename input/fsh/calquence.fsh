Calquence is a medicine used to treat cancer. 
  Calquence contains the active substance acalabrutinib.
  It belongs to a group of medicines called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.
What Calquence is used for
Calquence is used to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
CLL is a cancer of white blood cells called B-lymphocytes (or B-cells). These cells are part of the immune 
system (the body s defences).
How Calquence works
Calquence works by blocking BTK, a protein in the body that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. 
By blocking BTK, Calquence helps to kill and can reduce the number of cancer cells which can slow 
down the worsening of the disease. 
If you have any questions about how Calquence works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
