  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>DO NOT use CAMCEVI: 
- if you are a woman or a child under the age of 18; 
- if you are allergic to leuprorelin, or to similar medicines that affect your sex hormones 
(GnRH agonists); your doctor will help you identify these if necessary, <br />
- if you are allergic to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); 
- following surgical removal of your testicles. This medicine cannot further help to lower 
your testosterone levels once you have no testicles; 
- as the only treatment if you suffer from symptoms related to pressure on the spinal cord or 
a tumour in the spinal column. In this case, CAMCEVI may only be used in combination 
with other medicines for prostate cancer. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Seek urgent medical attention if you develop: 
- sudden headache; 
- vomiting; 
- loss of, or double vision; 
- loss of the ability to move the muscles in, or around, your eye; 
- altered mental state; 
- early symptoms of heart failure including 
o 
fatigue 
o 
swelling in your ankles; 
o 
increased need to urinate at night; 
o 
more severe symptoms such as rapid breathing, chest pain, and fainting. 
These may be signs of a condition called pituitary apoplexy, involving bleeding into, or impaired 
blood supply to the pituitary gland found at the base of the brain. Pituitary apoplexy can occur due to a 
tumor of the pituitary and can emerge rarely after starting treatment. Most cases occur within 2 weeks 
of the first dose, and some within the first hour. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using CAMCEVI if you 
- develop cardiovascular signs and symptoms such as fast chaotic heartbeats. These rapid 
heartbeats might cause you to faint or have fits (seizures); 
- have heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or 
are taking medicines for these conditions. The risk of these heart rhythm problems may 
get worse when using CAMCEVI. Your doctor may monitor your heart using an 
electrocardiogram (ECG); 
- have prostate cancer which has spread into your spine or brain. Your doctor will monitor 
you more closely during first few weeks of treatment; 
- suffer from diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar levels). CAMCEVI can make existing 
diabetes worse and therefore people with diabetes need more frequent testing of blood 
glucose levels. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse during treatment with CAMCEVI if you 
- experience a heart attack. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness and 
sweating; 
- suffer from a stroke. Symptoms include your face dropping on one side, not being able to lift 
your arms and slurred speech; 
- develop a bone fracture. Treatment with CAMCEVI can increase the risk for fractures due to 
osteoporosis (decrease in bone density); 
- have a fit (convulsions); 
- notice your blood sugar levels go up. Your doctor will monitor your blood glucose levels during 
treatment; 
- have difficulty urinating. There could be a blockage in your urinary tube. Your doctor will 
closely monitor you during the first weeks of treatment; 
- develop symptoms of spinal compression such as pain, numbness, or weakness in the arms, 
hands, legs, or feet. Your doctor will closely monitor you during your first few weeks of 
treatment. </p>
<p>Problems you may experience during the first weeks of treatment 
During the first weeks of treatment, there is generally a brief increase in the male sex hormone 
testosterone in the blood. This can lead to a temporary worsening in disease-related symptoms and 
also to new symptoms that you may not have experienced before. These especially include: 
- bone pain; 
- problems with urinating, pain, numbness, or weakness in the arms, hands, legs, or feet, or loss 
of bladder or bowel control as a result of spinal compression; 
- blood in your urine. 
These symptoms usually lessen with ongoing treatment. If not, you should contact your doctor. </p>
<p>You may be given another medicine before starting CAMCEVI to help lessen the initial rise of 
testosterone in your blood. You may remain on this other medicine for a few weeks of CAMCEVI 
treatment. </p>
<p>If CAMCEVI does not help 
Some patients have tumours, that are not sensitive to lower levels of testosterone. Please talk to your 
doctor if you think that the effect of CAMCEVI is too weak. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CAMCEVI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>CAMCEVI might interfere with some medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, 
procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide and ibutilide) or might increase the risk of heart rhythm 
problems when used with some other medicines, such as methadone (used for pain relief and used as 
heroin substitute when treating drug addicts), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), and antipsychotic 
medicines used for serious mental illnesses. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine is not intended for women. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Tiredness, dizziness and visual disturbances may occur in people being treated with CAMCEVI. If 
you suffer from any of these side effects, do not drive, use tools or operate machines. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You will be given CAMCEVI as a single injection under your skin (subcutaneous), 
once every 6 months, by your doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>This medicine should only be given to you by your doctor or a nurse, who will ensure it is injected 
properly under the skin and not into a vein. </p>
<p>After injection the medicine becomes solid, and then slowly releases leuprorelin into your body over a 
6-month period. </p>
<p>In combination with radiotherapy 
This medicine can be used before or at the same time as radiotherapy treatment for high-risk localised 
and locally advanced prostate cancer. High-risk localised means that the cancer is likely to spread 
beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues, becoming locally advanced. Locally advanced means that 
the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis to nearby tissues such as lymph nodes. </p>
<p>Monitoring your treatment 
Your doctor will monitor your response to treatment with blood tests, including prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA). </p>
<p>If you receive more CAMCEVI than you should 
Since the injection is given to you by your doctor or appropriately trained staff, an overdose is 
unlikely. If you inadvertently receive too much medicine, your doctor will monitor you and give you 
additional treatment as required. </p>
<p>If a dose of CAMCEVI is forgotten 
Talk to you doctor if you believe that your six monthly dose of CAMCEVI has been forgotten. </p>
<p>Effects when treatment with CAMCEVI is stopped 
As a general rule, the therapy for prostate cancer with CAMCEVI requires long-term treatment. 
Therefore, therapy should not be stopped too soon, even if you see your symptoms improve or if they 
disappear completely. If the treatment is stopped too early, your symptoms may return. Do not stop the 
treatment early without talking with your doctor first. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
