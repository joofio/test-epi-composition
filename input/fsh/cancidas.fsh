Cancidas contains a medicine called caspofungin. This belongs to a group of medicines called
anti-fungals. 
What Cancidas is used for
Cancidas is used to treat the following infections in children, adolescents and adults:
* serious fungal infections in your tissues or organs (called  invasive candidiasis ). This infection
is caused by fungal (yeast) cells called Candida. 
People who might get this type of infection include those who have just had an operation or
those whose immune systems are weak. Fever and chills that do not respond to an antibiotic are
the most common signs of this type of infection.
* fungal infections in your nose, nasal sinuses or lungs (called  invasive aspergillosis ) if other
anti-fungal treatments have not worked or have caused side effects. This infection is caused by a
mould called Aspergillus. 
People who might get this type of infection include those having chemotherapy, those who have
had a transplant and those whose immune systems are weak.
* suspected fungal infections if you have a fever and a low white cell count that have not
improved on treatment with an antibiotic. People who are at risk of getting a fungal infection
include those who have just had an operation or those whose immune systems are weak. 
How Cancidas works
Cancidas makes fungal cells fragile and stops the fungus from growing properly. This stops the
infection from spreading and gives the body s natural defences a chance to completely get rid of the
infection. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to caspofungin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given your medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Cancidas if:
* you are allergic to any other medicines
* you have ever had liver problems - you might need a different dose of this medicine
* you are already taking cyclosporin (used to help prevent organ transplant rejection or to
suppress your immune system) - as your doctor may need to run extra blood tests during your
treatment.
* if you have ever had any other medical problem. 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before
you are given Cancidas.
Cancidas may also cause Serious Cutaneous Adverse Reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
(SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).
Other medicines and Cancidas
Please tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any
other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines.
This is because Cancidas can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines
can affect the way Cancidas works. 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:
* cyclosporin or tacrolimus (used to help prevent organ transplant rejection or to suppress your
immune system) as your doctor may need to run extra blood tests during your treatment
* some HIV medicines such as efavirenz or nevirapine
* phenytoin or carbamazepine (used for the treatment of seizures) 
* dexamethasone (a steroid)
* rifampicin (an antibiotic).
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before
you are given Cancidas. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding or think
you are pregnant.
* Cancidas has not been studied in pregnant women. It should be used in pregnancy only if the
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the unborn baby. 
* Women given Cancidas should not breast-feed.
Driving and using machines
There is no information to suggest that Cancidas affects your ability to drive or operate machinery.
Cancidas contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

Instructions of how to reconstitute and dilute CANCIDAS:
Reconstitution of CANCIDAS
DO NOT USE ANY DILUENTS CONTAINING GLUCOSE as CANCIDAS is not stable in diluents
containing glucose. DO NOT MIX OR CO-INFUSE CANCIDAS WITH ANY OTHER
MEDICINES, as there are no data available on the compatibility of CANCIDAS with other
intravenous substances, additives, or medicinal products. Visually inspect the infusion solution for
particulate matter or discolouration.
CANCIDAS 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE IN ADULT PATIENTS (50 mg vial)
Step 1 Reconstitution of conventional vials 
To reconstitute the powder bring the vial to room temperature and aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for
injection. The concentrations of the reconstituted vials will be 5.2 mg/ml.
The white to off-white compact lyophilised powder will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear
solution is obtained. Reconstituted solutions should be visually inspected for particulate matter or
discolouration. This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at or below 25 C.
Step 2 Addition of reconstituted CANCIDAS to patient infusion solution 
Diluents for the final solution for infusion are: sodium chloride solution for injection, or lactated
Ringer s solution. The solution for infusion is prepared by aseptically adding the appropriate amount
of reconstituted concentrate (as shown in the table below) to a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle. Reduced
volume infusions in 100 ml may be used, when medically necessary, for 50 mg or 35 mg daily doses.
Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has precipitated.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE IN PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS (50 mg vial)
Calculation of Body Surface Area (BSA) for paediatric dosing
Before preparation of infusion, calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient using the
following formula: (Mosteller2 Formula)
Preparation of the 70 mg/m
2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 50-mg vial)
1. Determine the actual loading dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the patient's BSA
(as calculated above) and the following equation:
BSA (m2) X 70 mg/m2 = Loading Dose
The maximum loading dose on Day 1 should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's
calculated dose.
2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection.a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up
to 24 hours at or below 25 C.b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of
5.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicine equal to the calculated loading dose (Step 1) from the vial.
Aseptically transfer this volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or bottle)
containing 250 ml of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers
Injection. Alternatively, the volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to a
reduced volume of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers
Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This infusion solution must be used
within 24 hours if stored at or below 25 C or within 48 hours if stored refrigerated at 2 to 8 C. 
Preparation of the 50 mg/m
2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 50-mg vial)
1. Determine the actual daily maintenance dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the
patient's BSA (as calculated above) and the following equation:
BSA (m2) X 50 mg/m2 = Daily Maintenance Dose
The daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's calculated dose.
2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
2  Mosteller RD: Simplified Calculation of Body Surface Area. N Engl J Med 1987 Oct 22;317(17): 1098 (letter)
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection.a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up
to 24 hours at or below 25 C.b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of
5.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicine equal to the calculated daily maintenance dose (Step 1) from
the vial. Aseptically transfer this volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or
bottle) containing 250 ml of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated
Ringers Injection. Alternatively, the volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to
a reduced volume of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers
Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This infusion solution must be used
within 24 hours if stored at or below 25 C or within 48 hours if stored refrigerated at 2 to 8 C. 
Preparation notes: 
a The white to off-white cake will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear solution is obtained.
b Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter or discoloration during
reconstitution and prior to infusion. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has precipitated.
c CANCIDAS is formulated to provide the full labelled vial dose (50 mg) when 10 ml is withdrawn
from the vial.
CANCIDAS 70 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE IN ADULT PATIENTS (70 mg vial)
Step 1 Reconstitution of conventional vials 
To reconstitute the powder bring the vial to room temperature and aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for
injection. The concentrations of the reconstituted vials will be: 7.2 mg/ml.
The white to off-white compact lyophilised powder will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear
solution is obtained. Reconstituted solutions should be visually inspected for particulate matter or
discolouration. This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at or below 25 C.
Step 2 Addition of reconstituted CANCIDAS to patient infusion solution 
Diluents for the final solution for infusion are: sodium chloride solution for injection, or lactated
Ringer s solution. The solution for infusion is prepared by aseptically adding the appropriate amount
of reconstituted concentrate (as shown in the table below) to a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle. Reduced
volume infusions in 100 ml may be used, when medically necessary, for 50 mg or 35 mg daily doses.

Calculation of Body Surface Area (BSA) for paediatric dosing
Before preparation of infusion, calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient using the
following formula: (Mosteller3 Formula)
Preparation of the 70 mg/m
2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 70-mg vial)
1. Determine the actual loading dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the patient's BSA
(as calculated above) and the following equation:
BSA (m2) X 70 mg/m2 = Loading Dose
The maximum loading dose on Day 1 should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's
calculated dose.
2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection.a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up
to 24 hours at or below 25 C.b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of
7.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicine equal to the calculated loading dose (Step 1) from the vial.
Aseptically transfer this volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or bottle)
containing 250 ml of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers
Injection. Alternatively, the volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to a
reduced volume of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers
Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This infusion solution must be used
within 24 hours if stored at or below 25 C or within 48 hours if stored refrigerated at 2 to 8 C. 
Preparation of the 50 mg/m
2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 70-mg vial)
1. Determine the actual daily maintenance dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the
patient's BSA (as calculated above) and the following equation:
BSA (m2) X 50 mg/m2 = Daily Maintenance Dose
The daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's calculated dose.
2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection.a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up
to 24 hours at or below 25 C.b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of
7.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicine equal to the calculated daily maintenance dose (Step 1) from
the vial. Aseptically transfer this volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or
bottle) containing 250 ml of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated
Ringers Injection. Alternatively, the volume (ml)c of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to
a reduced volume of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers

Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This infusion solution must be used
within 24 hours if stored at or below 25 C or within 48 hours if stored refrigerated at 2 to 8 C.
Preparation notes: 
a. The white to off-white cake will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear solution is obtained.
b. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter or discolouration during
reconstitution and prior to infusion. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has precipitated.
c. CANCIDAS is formulated to provide the full labelled vial dose (70 mg) when 10 ml is withdrawn
from the vial.</p>         </div>"""
