pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Capecitabine Accord should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The dose of 
Capecitabine Accord is based on your body surface area. This is calculated from your height and 
weight. The usual dose for adults is 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning 
and evening). Two examples are provided here: A person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 
1.64 m has a body surface area of 1.7 m2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg 
two times daily. A person whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 
2.00 m2 and should take 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. </p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need 
to take it. </p>
<p>Your doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. 
* Take the tablets morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. 
* Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) and swallow 
them whole with water. Do not crush or cut tablets. If you cannot swallow Capecitabine 
Accord tablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. 
* It is important that you take all your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Capecitabine Accord tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no 
tablets are taken). This 21 day period is one treatment cycle. 
In combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1250 mg/m2 of body 
surface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no 
rest period). </p>
<p>If you take more Capecitabine Accord than you should 
If you take more Capecitabine Accord than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible before 
taking the next dose. 
You might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should, feeling or 
being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the 
intestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). Tell your 
doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Capecitabine Accord 
Do not take the missed dose at all. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.Instead, 
continue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor.  </p>
<p>If you stop taking Capecitabine Accord 
There are no side-effects caused by stopping treatment with capecitabine. In case you are using 
coumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping capecitabine might require that 
your doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
