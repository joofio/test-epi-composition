  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Casgevy is 
Casgevy is a gene therapy product that contains the active substance exagamglogene autotemcel.  </p>
<p>Casgevy is made specifically for you using your own blood stem cells. Blood stem cells can turn into 
other blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood platelets. These cells are 
collected from your blood, then genetically modified and given back to you as a transplant in a 
hospital.  </p>
<p>What Casgevy is used for 
Casgevy is used to treat: 
* People aged 12 years and older with beta-thalassemia who need regular blood transfusions 
(transfusion-dependent thalassemia, TDT). People with TDT do not make enough haemoglobin, a 
protein in the blood that carries oxygen through the body, due to a gene defect. This causes 
anaemia, and they need regular blood transfusions. 
* People aged 12 years and older with sickle cell disease (SCD) who have frequent painful crises 
(called vaso-occlusive crises or VOCs). Patients with SCD have a different form of haemoglobin 
(sickle cell haemoglobin or HbS) from other people due to a gene defect. HbS leads to abnormal 
sickle-shaped red blood cells that stick together and cannot easily move through blood vessels. 
This can lead to the blockage of blood vessels, causing VOCs. </p>
<p>How Casgevy works 
Casgevy works by increasing the production of a special type of haemoglobin called Haemoglobin F 
(foetal haemoglobin or HbF). Having more HbF improves the production and function of red blood 
cells. Because of this, people with TDT may not need blood transfusions and people with sickle cell 
disease may not experience VOCs. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You must not be given Casgevy: 
* if you are allergic to exagamglogene autotemcel or any of the other ingredients in this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
* if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the medicines you will be given to prepare 
you for treatment with Casgevy (see section 3). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if either of these applies to you or if you are not sure. The treatment 
will not be given to you if you are allergic to any of these medicines.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Casgevy. </p>
<p>Before treatment with Casgevy:<br />
* You will have two other types of medicines before you are given Casgevy. For more 
information on these medicines, see section 3. o Mobilisation medicine(s) to move the blood stem cells from your bone marrow into the 
blood stream so they can be collected to make Casgevy. This step will take 2-6 days. 
o Conditioning medicine is given to you shortly before you are given Casgevy. This 
creates space in the bone marrow for new blood cells to grow following treatment with 
Casgevy. 
* The doctor will discuss the possible impact of the conditioning medicine on fertility. See 
below under “Fertility in men and women”. 
* In people with SCD, it can be more difficult to move the blood stem cells from the bone 
marrow and therefore to collect them, compared to people with TDT. More mobilisations 
and collections may therefore be needed in people with SCD than people with TDT. </p>
<p>After treatment with Casgevy: 
* You will have fewer blood cells for a while, until Casgevy takes hold in your bone marrow. 
This includes 
o Low levels of platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). Low levels of platelets may 
cause bleeding.<br />
Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these signs of low platelet cell levels: 
severe headache, abnormal bruising, prolonged bleeding, or bleeding without injury 
such as nosebleeds, bleeding from gums, blood in your urine, stool, or vomit, or 
coughing up blood. 
o Low levels of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that usually prevents infections). 
Low levels of neutrophils may make infections more likely.<br />
Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these signs of low white blood cell 
levels: fever, chills, or other signs of infections such as sore throat, cough or shortness 
of breath, pain or burning when urinating or urinating often, or diarrhoea. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your doctor will monitor blood cell levels and give you treatment as required. The doctor 
will tell you when your platelets and neutrophils return to safe levels.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor will monitor your blood cell levels and overall health to help researchers 
understand the long-term effects of Casgevy.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some patients, haemoglobin levels may be lower than is normally expected for their age 
and sex. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After treatment with Casgevy there is a theoretical risk of blood cancers (myelodysplasia, 
leukaemia, or lymphoma), although this has not been seen in studies with Casgevy. Your 
doctor will monitor you at least once a year for 15 years for any signs of blood cancers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ingredients of Casgevy called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dextran 40 and Cas9 may cause 
serious allergic reactions. Your doctor or nurse will monitor you for signs and symptoms of 
an allergic reaction both during and after treatment with Casgevy. See also section 2 
“Casgevy contains sodium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casgevy is tested for the presence of infectious microbes, but a small risk of infection 
remains. Your doctor or nurse will monitor you for signs and symptoms of infections and 
provide treatment as needed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After treatment with Casgevy, you must not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casgevy is made from your own cells and is only given to you. Information about 
cell-based medicinal products must be kept for 30 years at the hospital where you receive 
the treatment. The information they keep will include your name, name of the product and 
the batch number(s) of Casgevy you received. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If Casgevy treatment cannot be completed or fails 
If Casgevy cannot be given after the conditioning medicine, or if the modified blood stem cells do not 
take hold in the body, the doctor may decide to give you an injection into a vein that contains your 
rescue cells (your own original and untreated blood stem cells) that are collected and stored before 
treatment starts (see section 3). If you are given rescue cells, you will not have any treatment benefit 
and will still need treatment for either TDT or SCD. </p>
<p>Children under 12 years of age 
Casgevy is not to be given to children under 12. It is not yet known if Casgevy is safe and effective in 
these children. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Casgevy 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Do not take medicines that remove iron from your body (chelating agents such as dexteroxamine, 
deferiprone and/or deferasirox) for at least 7 days before you are given the conditioning medicine. 
Your doctor will advise you if and when you can start taking these medicines after Casgevy treatment.  </p>
<p>Do not take other medicines for sickle cell disease (such as hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide, 
crizanlizumab or voxelotor) for at least 8 weeks before you are given the mobilisation and 
conditioning medicines. Your doctor will advise you if and when you should start taking these 
medicines after Casgevy treatment. </p>
<p>Vaccines called “live vaccines” must not be given for 6 weeks before the conditioning medicine used 
to prepare for Casgevy treatment, nor after treatment while your immune system (the body’s defence 
system) is recovering. Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
This treatment must not be given during pregnancy because of the possible effects of the 
conditioning medicine. The effects of Casgevy in pregnant women are not known. Talk to your doctor 
about pregnancy after receiving Casgevy.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Casgevy, talk to your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you will be given a pregnancy test before starting 
mobilisation and conditioning medicines to make sure you are not pregnant.  </p>
<p>Contraception in men and women 
If you are a woman who can get pregnant, or a man capable of fathering a child, you must use an 
effective method of contraception from the start of mobilisation treatment and for at least 6 months 
after receiving Casgevy. Talk to your doctor about which methods of contraception are appropriate. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding must be stopped during conditioning because of the possible effects of the 
conditioning medicine. It is not known whether the ingredients of Casgevy can pass into breast milk. 
Your doctor will discuss with you the benefit of breast-feeding for your baby versus potential risks of 
treatment. </p>
<p>Fertility in men and women 
It may not be possible for you to become pregnant or father a child after you have had the conditioning 
medicine. You should discuss your options with your doctor before treatment. These may include 
storing reproductive material (for instance, eggs, sperm) to use at a later time. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
The mobilisation medicine and conditioning medicines used before Casgevy treatment may cause 
dizziness and fatigue. If you feel dizzy, tired or unwell, do not drive, use machines or take part in 
activities that need you to be alert. </p>
<p>Casgevy contains sodium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 
This medicine contains approximately 5.3-70 mg sodium (main component of table salt) per vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.3-4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. The 
total number of vials comprising a dose varies per patient.  </p>
<p>This medicine contains approximately 50 mg DMSO per mL. See Section 2 “Warnings and 
precautions”. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Casgevy can only be given in an authorised treatment centre (specialised hospital) by doctors with 
experience in stem cell transplants, and in the treatment of patients with blood disorders such as TDT 
and SCD.  </p>
<p>STEP 1: Before Casgevy treatment, a doctor will give you a mobilisation medicine. This medicine 
moves blood stem cells from your bone marrow into the blood stream. The cells are then collected in a 
machine that separates the different blood cells (this is called apheresis). The entire step may happen 
more than once. Each collection step takes about one week.  </p>
<p>‘Rescue cells’ are also collected and stored at the hospital. These are your existing blood stem cells 
and are kept untreated in case there is a problem in the treatment process. See above in section 2, “If 
Casgevy treatment cannot be completed or fails”. </p>
<p>STEP 2: Your blood stem cells will be sent to the manufacturing site where they are used to make 
Casgevy. It may take up to 6 months from the time your cells are collected to manufacture and test 
Casgevy before it is sent back to your doctor. </p>
<p>STEP 3: Shortly before your stem cell transplant, the doctor will give you a conditioning medicine in 
the hospital. This step takes about 2 to 6 days and will prepare you for treatment by removing cells 
from the bone marrow, so they can be replaced with the modified cells in Casgevy. After you are 
given this medicine, the number of blood cells will fall to very low levels (see section 4). You will 
stay in the hospital at this point until after the Casgevy infusion. </p>
<p>STEP 4: One or more vials of Casgevy will be given as an injection into a vein through a central 
venous catheter. Central venous catheters are thin, flexible tubes, that are inserted by a doctor into a 
large vein to access your bloodstream. The risks of catheters are infections and the formation of blood 
clots. The doctor and nurses will monitor you for any central venous catheter complications. It may 
take a few hours for all of the injections to be given. After you are given Casgevy, you will stay in 
hospital so that your healthcare team can closely monitor your recovery. This can take approximately 
2 months, but times can vary. A doctor will decide when you can go home.  </p>         </div>"""
