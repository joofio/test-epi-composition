cystic fibrosis.  Cystic fibrosis, also known as mucoviscidosis, is a life-threatening inherited disease 
that affects the mucus glands of internal organs, especially the lungs, but also of the liver, pancreas, 
and the digestive system.  Cystic fibrosis in the lungs leads to clogging them with thick sticky mucus.<br />

section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Cayston: 
- if you are allergic to any other antibiotics (such as penicillins, cephalosporins, and/or 
carbapenems) 
- if you do not tolerate or have chest tightness from taking other inhaled medicines 
- if you have kidney problems 
- if you have ever coughed up any blood 
- if you have ever had low lung function tests. 
If any of these apply to you tell your doctor before using Cayston. </p>
<p>As an inhaled medicine, Cayston could cause you to cough and this could lead to coughing up blood.<br />
If you have ever coughed up blood you should only use Cayston if your doctor thinks the benefit of 
taking this medicine outweighs the risk of coughing up blood. </p>
<p>You may get a temporary lowering of lung function test result during treatment with Cayston, but this 
is typically not a lasting effect. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Cayston is not for use in children under the age of 6 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cayston </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>There are no clinical data on the use of Cayston in pregnant women, therefore you should not take 
Cayston during pregnancy unless specifically discussed with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you plan to breast-feed ask your doctor for advice before taking Cayston.  You can breast-feed 
during treatment with Cayston because the amount of Cayston likely to be passed to your child during 
breast-feeding will be extremely small. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Cayston is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

15 minutes and 4 hours and long acting bronchodilators can be taken between 30 minutes and 12 hours
