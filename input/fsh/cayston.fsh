that affects the mucus glands of internal organs, especially the lungs, but also of the liver, pancreas, 
and the digestive system.  Cystic fibrosis in the lungs leads to clogging them with thick sticky mucus.<br />

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to aztreonam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Cayston:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to any other antibiotics (such as penicillins, cephalosporins, and/or 
carbapenems) </li>
<li>if you do not tolerate or have chest tightness from taking other inhaled medicines </li>
<li>if you have kidney problems </li>
<li>if you have ever coughed up any blood </li>
<li>if you have ever had low lung function tests. 
If any of these apply to you tell your doctor before using Cayston. </li>
</ul>
<p>As an inhaled medicine, Cayston could cause you to cough and this could lead to coughing up blood.<br />
If you have ever coughed up blood you should only use Cayston if your doctor thinks the benefit of 
taking this medicine outweighs the risk of coughing up blood. </p>
<p>You may get a temporary lowering of lung function test result during treatment with Cayston, but this 
is typically not a lasting effect. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Cayston is not for use in children under the age of 6 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cayston </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>There are no clinical data on the use of Cayston in pregnant women, therefore you should not take 
Cayston during pregnancy unless specifically discussed with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you plan to breast-feed ask your doctor for advice before taking Cayston.  You can breast-feed 
during treatment with Cayston because the amount of Cayston likely to be passed to your child during 
breast-feeding will be extremely small. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Cayston is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take Cayston 3 times a day in repeated cycles of 28 days on therapy followed by 28 days 
off Cayston therapy.  Each of the three doses should be taken by inhalation at least four hours 
apart, using an Altera Nebuliser Handset.  You can use either an eBase Controller or an eFlow 
rapid Control Unit with the Altera Handset. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each dose consists of one vial of Cayston mixed with one ampoule of solvent.  Cayston needs to 
be mixed with a solvent before being inhaled through the Altera Nebuliser. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Put the prepared Cayston solution in the Altera Nebuliser Handset (see below).  Each treatment takes 
about 2 to 3 minutes to inhale. </p>
<p>Use a bronchodilator before each dose of Cayston.  Short acting bronchodilators can be taken between 
15 minutes and 4 hours and long acting bronchodilators can be taken between 30 minutes and 12 hours 
prior to each dose of Cayston. </p>
<p>If you are using other inhaled therapies to treat cystic fibrosis, the recommended order of use is as 
follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>bronchodilator </li>
<li>mucolytics (a medicine that helps to dissolve the thick mucous produced in the lungs) 
and finally: </li>
<li>Cayston. </li>
</ol>
<p>Do not mix Cayston with any other medicines in the Altera Nebuliser Handset. 
- Do not put other medicines in the Altera Nebuliser Handset. 
- Do not put the intravenous (injectable) form of aztreonam in the Altera Nebuliser Handset.<br />
Intravenous aztreonam is not suitable for inhalation. </p>
<p>How to take Cayston using the Altera Nebuliser Handset </p>
<p>You will need the following: 
* One amber-coloured vial of Cayston with a blue cap. 
* One plastic ampoule of solvent (0.17% w/v sodium chloride).  The information that appears on 
the solvent ampoule is provided in English only (see section 6). 
* An Altera Nebuliser Handset containing an Altera Aerosol Head connected to an eFlow Control 
Unit of the type 178 (eFlow rapid) or type 678 (eBase Controller). </p>
<p>You must use the Cayston specific Altera Nebuliser Handset containing an Altera Aerosol Head.<br />
Do not try to take Cayston using any other type of nebuliser handset (including the eFlow rapid 
handset). </p>
<p>Check that your nebuliser works properly before starting your treatment with Cayston.  Read the 
manufacturer s instructions for use provided with your Altera Nebuliser System carefully. </p>
<p>Preparing your Cayston for inhalation </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not prepare Cayston until you are ready to administer a dose. </li>
<li>Do not use Cayston if you notice that the package has been tampered with. </li>
<li>Do not use Cayston if it has been stored outside a refrigerator for more than 28 days. </li>
<li>
<p>Do not use the solvent or prepared Cayston if it is cloudy or if there are particles in the solution. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take one amber vial of Cayston and one ampoule of solvent from the box.  Solvent 
ampoules must be separated by gently pulling them apart. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently tap the amber vial containing the Cayston so that the powder settles at the bottom.<br />
This helps to ensure that you get the proper dose of medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow Step A to D in Figure 1 below to open the amber vial: </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step A: With the blue cap tab facing toward 
you, place the vial on a flat surface. Using one 
hand to hold the vial steady, use the other hand 
to slowly flip up the blue cap. 
Step B: Pull the blue cap down to a flat 
(horizontal) position (where the bottom of the 
blue cap faces up), to prepare the metal seal for 
removal. Do not completely tear through the 
metal seal. </p>
<p>Step C: While continuing to hold the vial 
steady with one hand, use the other hand to 
slowly pull the blue cap  in a counterclockwise 
direction. Do not twist the blue cap. 
Step D: When the metal seal opens, continue to 
slowly pull on the blue cap in a 
counterclockwise direction until the metal seal 
is completely removed. 
Figure 1 </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Safely dispose of the metal seal.  Carefully remove (but do not yet discard) the rubber stopper. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the ampoule of solvent by twisting off the tip.  Squeeze out the contents completely into 
the vial (Figure 2).  Next, gently swirl the vial until the powder has completely dissolved and 
the liquid is clear. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It s best to use Cayston immediately after you have made up the solution.  But, if you cannot use 
the prepared dose straight away, replace the stopper in the vial and store in a refrigerator.  Use the 
prepared solution within 8 hours. </p>
<p>Figure 2 </p>
<p>Preparing the Altera Nebuliser to take your Cayston </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure the Altera Nebuliser Handset is on a flat, stable surface. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the medicine cap by twisting anticlockwise. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour all of the prepared Cayston from the vial into the Altera Nebuliser Handset medicine 
reservoir (Figure 3a).  Be sure to completely empty the vial.  Gently tap the vial against the side 
of the medicine reservoir if necessary. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the medicine reservoir by aligning the tabs of the medicine cap with the slots on the 
reservoir.  Press down and turn the cap clockwise as far as it will go (Figure 3b). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the Altera Nebuliser to take your Cayston </p>
<ol>
<li>Begin your treatment.  Sit in a relaxed, upright position.  Hold the handset level and place the 
mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it (Figure 4). </li>
</ol>
<p>Keep the handset level. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Press and hold the On/Off button on the Control Unit for a few seconds.  You will hear one 
 beep  and the status light will turn green. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a few seconds, an aerosol mist will begin to flow into the Aerosol Chamber of the Altera 
Nebuliser Handset.  If aerosol mist does not begin to flow, please refer to the Altera manual for 
information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe normally (inhale and exhale) through the mouthpiece.  Avoid breathing through your 
nose.  Continue to inhale and exhale comfortably until the treatment is finished. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When all of the medicine has been delivered, you will hear a tone that means  treatment 
complete  (2 beeps). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 4 </p>
<p>Figure 3a </p>
<p>Figure 3b 
6. When treatment is complete, open the medicine cap to ensure that all medicine has been used.<br />
A few drops of medicine may remain in the reservoir at the end of treatment.  If there is more 
than a few drops of liquid left, replace the medicine cap and restart treatment. </p>
<ol>
<li>Once treatment is complete, disconnect the Control Unit and take apart the Altera Nebuliser 
Handset for cleaning and disinfecting.  For complete details on cleaning and disinfecting refer to 
the manufacturer s instructions for use provided with your Altera Nebuliser Handset. </li>
</ol>
<p>What if I need to stop my treatment before I ve finished? 
8. If for any reason you must stop the treatment before you have finished, press and hold the 
On/Off button for one full second.  To re-start the treatment, press and hold the On/Off button 
for one full second and then restart the treatment. </p>
<p>Replacing the Altera Nebuliser Handset </p>
<p>The Altera Nebuliser Handset is designed to last for three 28-day courses of Cayston when used as 
directed.  After this time replace your Altera Nebuliser Handset, including the aerosol head.  If you 
notice that the performance has changed before this time (for instance, if it takes longer to produce a 
mist, more than 5 minutes), please refer to the Altera Nebuliser instructions for use. </p>
<p>If you take more Cayston than you should </p>
<p>If you have taken more Cayston than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Cayston </p>
<p>If you miss a dose, you can still take all 3 daily doses as long as they are at least 4 hours apart.  If you 
can t leave a gap of 4 hours just skip the missed dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Cayston </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Cayston without first talking to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
