<p>Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is used to treat cancer of the breast in patients at risk for heart 
problems. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  is also used to treat cancer of the ovary. It is used to kill 
cancer cells, shrink the size of the tumour, delay the growth of the tumour, and extend your survival. </p>
<p>Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is also used in combination with another medicine, bortezomib, to 
treat multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. </p>
<p>Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is also used to produce an improvement in your Kaposi’s sarcoma 
including flattening, lightening and even shrinkage of the cancer. Other symptoms of Kaposi’s 
sarcoma, such as swelling around the tumour, may also improve or disappear. </p>
<p>Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  contains a medicine which is able to interact with cells in such a way 
as to selectively kill cancer cells. The doxorubicin hydrochloride in Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is 
enclosed in tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes which help to deliver the medicinal product from 
the blood stream to the cancerous tissue rather than healthy normal tissue. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before receiving Celdoxome pegylated liposomal: 
- if you are receiving any treatment for heart disease or liver disease 
- if you are diabetic, because Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  contains sugar which may require 
an adjustment to the treatment of your diabetes </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have Kaposi’s sarcoma and have had your spleen removed </li>
<li>if you notice sores, discolouration or any discomfort in your mouth. </li>
</ul>
<p>The cases of Interstitial lung diseases have been observed in patients receiving pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin including fatal cases. The symptoms of Interstitial lung disease are cough and shortness of 
breath sometimes with fever which are not caused by physical activity. Seek immediate medical 
attention, if you experience symptoms that may be signs of Interstitial lung disease. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal  should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is not 
known how the medicine will affect them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Celdoxome pegylated liposomal 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist 
-<br />
if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
-<br />
about any other cancer treatments you are on or have been taking, as particular care needs to be 
taken with treatments which reduce the number of white blood cells, as this may cause further 
reduction in the number of white blood cells. If you are unsure about what treatments you have 
received or any illnesses you have had, discuss these with your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Because the active ingredient doxorubicin hydrochloride in Celdoxome pegylated liposomal may 
cause birth defects, it is important to tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant. Avoid becoming 
pregnant while you or your partner are taking Celdoxome pegylated liposomal and in the six months 
following discontinuation of Celdoxome pegylated liposomal treatment. </p>
<p>Because doxorubicin hydrochloride may be harmful to nursing infants, women must discontinue 
breast-feeding before starting treatment with Celdoxome pegylated liposomal. Health experts 
recommend that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order 
to avoid transmission of HIV. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel tired or sleepy from treatment with Celdoxome 
pegylated liposomal. </p>
<p>Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains soya oil and sodium 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains soya oil. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this 
medicine. See “Do not use Celdoxome pegylated liposomal”. 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say 
‘essentially sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is given 
If you are being treated for breast cancer or ovarian cancer, Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be 
administered at a dose of 50 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and 
weight). The dose is repeated every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and you are 
able to tolerate the treatment. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your 
body surface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on Day 4 of the 
bortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The dose is repeated as long as 
you respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for Kaposi’s sarcoma, Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be administered at 
a dose of 20 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight). The 
dose is repeated every 2 to 3 weeks for 2-3 months, then as often as necessary to maintain an 
improvement in your condition. </p>
<p>How Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is given 
Celdoxome pegylated liposomal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip (infusion) into a vein. 
Depending on the dose and indication, this may take from 30 minutes to more than one hour (i.e., 
90 minutes). </p>
<p>If you use more Celdoxome pegylated liposomal than you should 
Acute overdosing worsens side effects like sores in the mouth or decreases the number of white blood 
cells and platelets in the blood. Treatment will include administration of antibiotics, platelet cell 
transfusions, use of factors which stimulate production of white blood cells and symptomatic treatment 
of mouth sores. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

effects may interfere with certain daily activities, and may last for 4 weeks or longer before </li>
</ul>
<p>resolving completely. The doctor may wish to delay the start and/or reduce the dose of the next 
treatment (see Strategies to prevent and treat hand foot syndrome, below)

<p>Other side effects 
Between infusions, the following may occur: </p>
<h2>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)</h2>
<p>decrease in the number of white blood cells, which can increase the chances of infections. In 
rare cases, having low white blood cells may lead to severe infection. Anaemia (reduction in red 
blood cells) may cause tiredness, and decreased platelets in the blood may increase the risk of 
bleeding. It is because of the potential changes in your blood cells that you will have regular 
blood tests.
