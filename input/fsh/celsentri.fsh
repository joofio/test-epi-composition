  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>CELSENTRI contains a medicine called maraviroc. Maraviroc belongs to a group of medicines 
called CCR5 antagonists. CELSENTRI works by blocking a receptor called CCR5 which HIV uses 
to enter and infect your blood cells. </p>
<p>CELSENTRI is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) in adults, 
adolescents and children of 2 years and older, and weighing at least 10 kg. </p>
<p>CELSENTRI must be taken in combination with other medicines which are also used to treat the 
HIV infection. These medicines are all called anti-HIV medicines or antiretrovirals. </p>
<p>CELSENTRI, as part of combination therapy, reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps 
it at a low level. This helps your body to increase the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a 
type of white blood cell that are important in helping your body to fight infection. </p>
<p>2 
What you need to know before you take CELSENTRI  </p>
<p>Do not take CELSENTRI 
* if you (or your child, if they are the patient) are allergic to maraviroc or to peanut or soya or to 
any of the other ingredients of CELSENTRI (listed in section 6 ). 
  Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you or your child. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking or giving CELSENTRI. </p>
<p>Your doctor must take blood samples to test whether CELSENTRI is an appropriate treatment for 
you (or your child, if they are the patient). </p>
<p>Some people taking CELSENTRI have developed serious allergic reactions or skin reactions (see 
also  Serious side effects  in section 4). </p>
<p>Before taking this medicine, make sure that your doctor knows if you (or your child) have or in the 
past had any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>liver problems, including chronic hepatitis B or C. Only a limited number of people with liver 
problems have taken CELSENTRI. Your liver function may need to be closely monitored.<br />
(See also  Liver problems  in section 4). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low blood pressure, including dizziness when you stand up or sit up quickly, or if you are 
taking any medicines to lower blood pressure. This is due to a sudden fall in blood pressure. If 
this happens, lie down until you (or your child) feel better. When getting up, do so as slowly as 
possible. </p>
</li>
<li>tuberculosis (TB) or serious fungal infections. CELSENTRI could potentially increase your 
risk of developing infections. </li>
<li>kidney problems. This is particularly important if you are also taking some other medicines 
(see  Other medicines and CELSENTRI  later in section 2). 
  problems with your heart or circulatory system. Only a limited number of people with 
serious heart or circulatory problems have taken CELSENTRI. 
  Tell your doctor before starting treatment if you think any of these apply to you (or your 
child). </li>
</ul>
<p>Conditions you need to look out for </p>
<p>Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. 
These include: 
  symptoms of infections and inflammation 
  joint pain, stiffness and bone problems </p>
<p>You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you re taking 
CELSENTRI. 
  Read the information  Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV  in 
Section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Older people 
CELSENTRI has only been taken by limited numbers of people 65 years or older. If you belong to 
this age group, discuss with your doctor if you can use CELSENTRI. </p>
<p>Children 
The use of CELSENTRI has not been tested in children under the age of 2 or weighing less than kg . Therefore CELSENTRI is not recommended in children younger than 2, or weighing less than 
10 kg. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CELSENTRI  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) are taking, any other medicines, have 
recently taken, or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) begin taking a new medicine while  taking 
CELSENTRI. </p>
<p>Medicines containing St. John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to prevent CELSENTRI 
from working properly. You should not take them while you re taking CELSENTRI. </p>
<p>Some medicines may change the amount of CELSENTRI in the body when they are taken at the 
same time as CELSENTRI. These include: 
  other medicines to treat HIV or hepatitis C infection (such as atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, 
efavirenz, etravirine, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
boceprevir, telaprevir) 
   antibiotics (clarithromycin, telithromycin, rifampicin, rifabutin)<br />
  antifungal medicines (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole) 
  anticonvulsant medicines (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking any of these medicines. This will allow your 
doctor to prescribe the right dose of CELSENTRI.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, if you become pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby: 
   Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking CELSENTRI. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV, because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk. <br />
It is not known whether the ingredients in CELSENTRI can also pass into breast milk. If you are 
breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon 
as possible: </p>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>CELSENTRI can make you dizzy. 
  Do not drive, cycle, or operate tools or machines unless you are sure you re not affected. </p>
<p>CELSENTRI contains soya lecithin and sodium. </p>
<p>If you are allergic to peanut or soya do not use this medicinal product.  </p>
<p>CELSENTRI contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

child) are unable to swallow tablets. </p>
<p>How much to take </p>
<p>Adults 
The recommended dose of CELSENTRI is 150 mg, 300 mg or 600 mg twice per day depending 
on other medicines that you are taking at the same time. Always take the dose recommended by 
your doctor. </p>
<p>People with kidney problems<br />
If you have a kidney problem, your doctor may alter your dose.<br />
  Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. </p>
<p>Adolescents and children from 2 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg 
Your doctor will decide the correct dose of CELSENTRI based on weight and on other medicines 
being taken at the same time. </p>
<p>CELSENTRI can be taken with or without food. CELSENTRI should always be taken by 
mouth.  </p>
<p>CELSENTRI must be taken in combination with other medicines to treat HIV. Refer to the 
Package Leaflets of these other medicines for guidance on how to take them.  </p>

and then continue with the next dose at its regular time.  </p>
<p>If it is almost time for the next dose, do not take or give the missed dose. Wait for the next dose at 
its regular time. 
Do not take or give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you or your child stop taking CELSENTRI  </p>
<p>Keep taking CELSENTRI until your doctor tells you to stop. 
Taking your medicines at the right time every day is important, as it makes sure the HIV infection 
does not increase in your body.  Therefore, unless your doctor tells you (or your child) to stop 
treatment, it is important to keep taking CELSENTRI correctly, as described above. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

  decrease in number of blood cells (seen in blood test results). </p>
<p>Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV 
People taking combination therapy for HIV may get other side effects. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation<br />
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When they start treatment, the immune 
system becomes stronger, so the body starts to fight infections. 
Symptoms of infection and inflammation may develop, caused by either: 
  old, hidden infections flaring up again as the body fights them 
  the immune system attacking healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). 
The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking 
medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
  muscle weakness<br />
  weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body<br />
  palpitations or tremor 
  hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement). 
If you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above: 
  Tell your doctor immediately. Don t take other medicines for the infection without your 
doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With 
this condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. 
It is not known how common this condition is. You may be more likely to develop it: 
  if you have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
  if you are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
  if you drink alcohol 
  if you have a very weak immune system<br />
  if you are overweight. </p>
<p>Signs to look out for include: 
  stiffness in the joints 
  aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
  difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
  Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the
