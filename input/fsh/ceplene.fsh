<li>What Ceplene is and what is used for </li>
</ol>
<p>Ceplene belongs to a group of medicines called immunomodulatory medicines.  These medicines help 
the body s immune system fight diseases like cancer by improving the immune system s natural role 
in fighting disease.  The active substance in Ceplene is histamine dihydrochloride; it is identical to a 
naturally occurring substance in the body.  It is used together with low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2), 
another medicine which helps the immune system to fight diseases like cancer.  </p>
<p>Ceplene is used in adult patients, together with IL-2, to treat a particular type of leukaemia called 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) which is a cancer of blood forming cells in the bone marrow. It is 
used to maintain the remission (the period during which the disease is less severe or not detectable).<br />
Ceplene with IL-2 will help your immune system attack any remaining cancer cells after a previous 
cancer treatment.  </p>
<p>During your treatment, you will always use IL-2 AND Ceplene.  Ask your doctor if you have any 
questions about Ceplene or IL-</p>         </div>"""

(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>If you have severe heart problems. </p>
<p>If you are receiving one of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steroids such as prednisone and dexamethasone.  They are used to inhibit activity of 
the immune system (immunosuppressant) and to reduce inflammation.   </li>
<li>Clonidine, a medicine used to reduce high blood pressure. </li>
<li>H2 blockers such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine or nizatidine which are used to 
treat stomach ulcers, indigestion (dyspepsia) or heartburn. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have received a stem cell transplant (a kind of bone marrow transplant) from a donor.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Ceplene. </p>
<p>Ceplene and IL-2 are not to be injected at the same time. IL-2 has to be injected first. Ceplene must be 
injected 1 to 3 minutes later. </p>
<p>Ceplene must be injected slowly in the layer of tissue just under the skin (subcutaneously), over a 
period of approximately 5 to 15 minutes.  Rapid injection can cause a drop in your blood pressure and 
make you feel faint or even pass out. </p>
<p>You will start your treatment with Ceplene in the clinic under supervision of a doctor.  You must be 
monitored to check how you respond to treatment.  Your doctor will check your blood pressure, pulse 
rate and lung function.  Your doctor will also carry out some blood tests during treatment. </p>
<p>If you have had one of the following conditions you will be monitored in the hospital during the next 
treatment days or the next cycles of treatment: </p>
<p>bleeding ulcers, </p>
<p>stroke, </p>
<p>narrowing of the arteries (systemic peripheral arterial disease), </p>
<p>heart disease (for severe heart problems see above  Do not use Ceplene ), </p>
<p>a history of auto-immune disease (a disease where the immune system attacks the body s own 
cells or tissues, such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or 
psoriasis). </p>
<p>If you are taking any other medicines mentioned under  Other medicines and Ceplene  or if you are to 
have an operation or special X-ray investigation requiring an injection, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have an infection, your doctor will closely monitor you.  If you have had an infection within 
14 days of starting this treatment which required you to take medicines to treat infections (antibiotics, 
antifungals or antivirals), your doctor will closely monitor you. </p>
<p>If you have kidney problems, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.  A decrease of blood 
pressure may occur.   </p>
<p>If you have liver problems, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.  Your doctor may change 
your dose.<br />
Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Ceplene use is not recommended in children and adolescents, as there is no information available 
about using this medicine in this age group.   </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ceplene </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>If you are taking any of the following medicines, please be sure to discuss this with your doctor or 
pharmacist before using Ceplene. Some of them must not be taken during treatment with Ceplene or 
may need special precautions: </p>
<p>Steroids such as prednisone and dexamethasone.  They are used to inhibit activity of the 
immune system (immunosuppressant) and to reduce inflammation (see above  Do not use 
Ceplene ). </p>
<p>H2 blockers such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine or nizatidine. They are used to treat 
stomach ulcers, indigestion (dyspepsia) or heartburn (see above  Do not use Ceplene ).   </p>
<p>Antihistamines used to treat allergy.  </p>
<p>Certain anti-psychotics such as chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, thoridazine, clozapine and 
risperidone.  They are used to treat mental conditions.  </p>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressant medicines such as amitryptiline, imipramine, or monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors, such as phenelzine, isocarboxazide, tranylcypromine or moclobemide.  They are 
used to treat depression.  </p>
<p>Anti-malarial or medicines used to treat infections responsible for sleeping sickness. </p>
<p>Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol. They are used for angina and heart 
beat disorders. </p>
<p>Any treatment for high blood pressure (for example thiazide diuretics [bendrofluazide], ACE 
inhibitors [captopril], calcium antagonists [nifedipine] and alpha-blockers [prazosin]).  </p>
<p>Also, if you are to have an operation or special X-ray investigation requiring an injection, first make 
sure that your doctor knows that you are receiving Ceplene.  Certain medicines used for an operation 
(for example neuromuscular blocking medicines and narcotic pain-killers) or dyes used for certain X-
rays may interfere with this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>There is no information about the use of Ceplene in pregnant women. Therefore, the treatment with 
Ceplene and IL-2 must not be used during pregnancy. </p>
<p>For both men and women using this treatment, an effective method of contraception must be used as it 
is important not to conceive a child while being treated with Ceplene and IL-</p>         </div>"""
