a natural protein that is made in the liver and is present in your blood. Protein C plays a major role in 
prevention of excessive clot formation thus, prevent and/or treat intravascular thrombosis. </p>
<p>CEPROTIN is used in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic and haemorrhagic skin lesions 
(named purpura fulminans) in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency. CEPROTIN may 
also be used in the treatment and prevention of a rare complication of a blood thinner medicine 
(anticoagulant medicine named coumarin) which may result in severe skin lesion (necrosis). 
Additionally, CEPROTIN may be used in the treatment of blood clot (venous thrombotic) events. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to human protein C or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) including mouse protein or heparin. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, in the case of life-threatening thrombotic complications your doctor may still decide to 
continue treatment with CEPROTIN. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using CEPROTIN. Take special care with CEPROTIN if 
symptoms of allergy occur. Symptoms of allergy include rash, hives, breathing difficulties, low blood 
pressure, tightness of chest, and shock. If such symptoms occur during the administration of 
CEPROTIN, injection should be stopped. Such symptoms may constitute an allergic reaction to any 
of the components, to mouse protein or heparin. The preparation may contain traces of heparin 
and/or mouse protein as a result of the manufacturing process. If such a reaction occurs, your doctor 
will decide on the most appropriate treatment. 
If the preparation is used in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency, antibodies inhibiting 
protein C may develop that can inhibit protein C and therefore diminish the effect of the preparation. 
However, this has not been observed in the clinical studies to date. </p>
<p>When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to 
make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools 
of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the 
processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when 
medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other 
types of infections. </p>
<p>The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The 
measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B 19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals 
whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or 
haemolytic anaemia). </p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you 
regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived Protein C products. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CEPROTIN </p>
<p>No interactions with other medicinal products are currently known. 
Nevertheless, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>If you change to treatment with oral anticoagulants, treatment with CEPROTIN must continue until 
the blood level of the oral anticoagulation is adequate and stable. </p>
<p>CEPROTIN with food and drink </p>
<p>Not applicable. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor will decide if CEPROTIN may be used during pregnancy and lactation. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>CEPROTIN has no influence on your ability to drive or to operate machines. </p>
<p>CEPROTIN contains Sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 22.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 1.1% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>CEPROTIN is intended for intravenous administration (infusion into a vein). It is given to you 
under close supervision of your doctor who is experienced in substitution therapy of coagulation 
factors/inhibitors and where monitoring of protein C activity is possible. Dosage will vary depending 
on your condition and your body weight. </p>
<p>Dosage </p>
<p>The dose, administration frequency and duration of treatment depend on the severity of the protein C 
deficiency as well as on your clinical condition and on your plasma level of protein C. They should be 
adjusted accordingly on the basis of clinical effectiveness and laboratory assessment. </p>
<p>Treatment of acute episodes and short-term prophylaxis<br />
A protein C activity of 100 % (1 IU/ml) should be achieved initially and the activity should be intained 
above 25 % for the duration of the treatment. </p>
<p>An initial dose of 60 to 80 IU/kg should be administered. Your physician will take several blood 
drawings over time to determine how long protein C is remaining in your body. </p>
<p>The measurement of protein C activity using chromogenic substrates is recommended for the 
determination of your plasma level for protein C before and during treatment with CEPROTIN. </p>
<p>The dosage should be determined on the basis of laboratory measurements of the protein C activity. 
In the case of an acute thrombotic event these should be performed every 6 hours until your condition 
is stabilised, thereafter twice a day and always immediately before the next injection. It should be kept 
in mind that the half-life of protein C may be severely shortened in certain clinical conditions such as 
acute thrombosis with purpura fulminans and skin necrosis. </p>
<p>If the response to CEPROTIN injection is satisfactory, dosing may be gradually reduced to 12 hourly 
dosing ensuring trough protein C activity &gt;25%. </p>
<p>If you receive prophylactic administration of protein C, higher trough levels may be warranted in 
situations of an increased risk of thrombosis (such as infection, trauma, or surgical intervention). </p>
<p>Long-term prophylaxis<br />
For the long-term prophylactic treatment, a dose of 45 to 60 IU/kg every 12 hours is recommended. 
Measurement of the protein C activity should be performed to ensure trough levels of 25% or more.<br />
In rare cases, subcutaneous infusion of 250 - 350 IU/kg has produced therapeutic plasma protein C 
levels in patients with no intravenous access. </p>
<p>If you have kidney and/or liver disease, please inform your doctor, because he may have to adjust your 
treatment accordingly. </p>
<p>Combination treatment<br />
If you are switched to permanent prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants, protein C replacement is to be 
discontinued only when stable anticoagulation is obtained (see  Important information about some of 
the ingredients of CEPROTIN ). </p>
<p>At start of a combination treatment of anticoagulants (especially Vitamin K antagonists) with Protein 
C, stable activity levels of Protein C above 0.25 IU/ml should be maintained before starting the 
anticoagulation. Careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) is recommended. In 
the combination of Protein C Concentrate and anticoagulants, a Protein C trough level of about 10% or 
more is recommended to be maintained. </p>
<p>If you have APC resistance which is a thromboembolic risk factor present in up to 5 % of the 
population in Europe your doctor may need to adjust your treatment accordingly. </p>
<p>Administration </p>
<p>CEPROTIN will be administered to you by intravenous injection after reconstitution of the powder for 
solution for injection with Sterilised Water for Injections. It is strongly recommended that every time 
you receive a dose of CEPROTIN the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to 
maintain a record of the batches used. </p>
<p>Reconstitute lyophilised CEPROTIN powder for solution for injection, with the supplied solvent 
(Sterilised Water for Injections) using the sterile transfer needle. Gently rotate the vial until all powder 
is dissolved. </p>
<p>After reconstitution, the solution is drawn through the sterile filter needle into a sterile disposable 
syringe. A separate unused filter needle must be used to withdraw each vial of reconstituted 
CEPROTIN. The solution should be discarded if particulate matter is visible. </p>
<p>The reconstituted solution should be administered immediately by intravenous injection. </p>
<p>CEPROTIN should be administered at a maximum injection rate of 2 ml per minute. In children with 
a body weight of less than 10 kg, the injection rate should not exceed a rate of 0.2 ml/kg/min. </p>
<p>All unused solution, empty vials and used needles and syringes must be discarded appropriately. </p>
<p>Frequency and duration of treatment depend on the severity of your protein C deficiency, on the 
results of determination of protein C levels in your plasma as well as on the location and extent of 
thrombosis. </p>
<p>In case of acute thrombosis CEPROTIN may be administered to you every 6 hours. As the tendency 
for thrombus formation decreases, the frequency may be reduced. </p>
<p>If you use more CEPROTIN than you should </p>
<p>It is recommended that you adhere to the dose level and frequency of administration as recommended 
by your doctor. In case you administered more CEPROTIN than recommended, please inform your 
doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to use CEPROTIN </p>
<p>Not applicable. </p>
<p>If you stop using CEPROTIN </p>
<p>Do not stop using CEPROTIN without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
