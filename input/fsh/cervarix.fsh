  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Cervarix is a vaccine intended to protect from the age of 9 years against the diseases caused by 
infection with Human Papillomaviruses (HPV). </p>
<p>These diseases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>cervical cancer (cancer of the cervix i.e. lower part of the uterus or womb) and anal cancer,  </li>
<li>precancerous cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal lesions (changes in genital or anal cells that have a 
risk of turning into cancer). </li>
</ul>
<p>The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types contained in the vaccine (HPV types 16 and 18) are 
responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers, 90% of anal cancers, 70% of HPV-related pre-
cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina and 78% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the anus. 
Other HPV types can also cause ano-genital cancers. Cervarix does not protect against all HPV types. </p>
<p>When a female or a male individual is vaccinated with Cervarix, the immune system (the body s 
natural defence system) will make antibodies against HPV types 16 and 18. Cervarix is not infectious and so, it cannot cause HPV related diseases. </p>
<p>Cervarix is not used to treat HPV related diseases already present at the time of vaccination. </p>
<p>Cervarix should be used in accordance with official guidelines. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine 
(listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of 
breath and swelling of the face or tongue. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given Cervarix 
* if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
* if you have any disease which reduces your resistance to infection such as HIV infection. 
* if you have a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone the 
vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to 
the doctor first. </p>
<p>Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>As with all vaccines, Cervarix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. </p>
<p>Cervarix does not protect people from diseases caused by infection with HPV types 16 or 18 if they 
are already infected with Human Papillomavirus type 16 or 18 at the time of vaccination. </p>
<p>Although vaccination may protect you against cervical cancer, it is not a substitute for regular cervical 
screening. You should continue to follow your doctor s advice on cervical smear/Pap test (test to 
screen for changes in cells of the cervix caused by an HPV infection) and preventative and protective 
measures. </p>
<p>As Cervarix will not protect against all types of Human Papillomavirus, appropriate precautions 
against exposure to HPV and sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used. </p>
<p>Cervarix will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cervarix 
Cervarix can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d), tetanus (T) and 
pertussis [acellular] (pa) with or without inactivated poliomyelitis (IPV), (dTpa, dTpa -IPV vaccines), 
with a combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) or a hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B), or 
with a meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT), 
at a separate injection site (another part of your body, e.g. the other arm) during the same visit. </p>
<p>Cervarix may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system. </p>
<p>In clinical trials, oral contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Cervarix. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, might take any other medicines, or have 
recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, if pregnancy occurs during the course of vaccination or if you are trying to 
become pregnant it is recommended to postpone or interrupt vaccination until after completion of the 
pregnancy. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before you are given this vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Cervarix is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any 
machines if you are feeling unwell. </p>
<p>Cervarix contains sodium chloride. </p>
<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

The doctor or nurse will give Cervarix as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm.  </p>
<p>How much is given 
Cervarix is intended for use from 9 years of age onwards.  </p>
<p>The total number of injections you will receive depends on your age at the time of the first injection. </p>
<p>If you are between 9 and 14 years old </p>
<p>You will receive 2 injections: </p>
<p>First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: given between 5 and 13 months after first injection </p>

<p>You will receive 3 injections: </p>
<p>First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 1 month after first injection 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection </p>
<p>If necessary, the vaccination schedule can be more flexible. Please speak to your doctor for more 
information. </p>
<p>When Cervarix is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Cervarix (and not another vaccine 
against HPV) be given for the complete vaccination course. </p>
<p>Cervarix is not recommended for use below 9 years of age. </p>
<p>The vaccine should never be given into a vein. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose 
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>If you do not finish the complete vaccination course (two or three injections depending on your age at 
vaccination), you may not get the best response and protection from the vaccination. </p>         </div>"""
