  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Cetrotide is 
Cetrotide contains a medicine called  cetrorelix . This medicine stops your body from releasing an egg 
from your ovary (ovulation) during your menstrual cycle. Cetrotide belongs to a group of medicines 
called  anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormones . </p>
<p>What Cetrotide is used for 
Cetrotide is one of the medicines used during  assisted reproductive techniques  to help you get 
pregnant. It stops eggs being released straight away. This is because if the eggs are released too early 
(premature ovulation) it may not be possible for your doctor to collect them. </p>
<p>How Cetrotide works 
Cetrotide blocks a natural hormone in your body called LHRH ( luteinising hormone releasing 
hormone ). 
* LHRH controls another hormone, called LH ( luteinising hormone ). 
* LH stimulates ovulation during your menstrual cycle.  </p>
<p>This means that Cetrotide stops the chain of events that leads to an egg being released from your 
ovary. When your eggs are ready to be collected, another medicine will be given to you that will 
release them (ovulation induction). </p>         </div>"""

section 6). 
* if you are allergic to medicines similar to Cetrotide (any other peptide hormones). 
* if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
* if you have severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>Do not use Cetrotide if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Allergies 
Tell your doctor before using Cetrotide if you have an active allergy or have had allergies in the past. </p>
<p>Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
Cetrotide is used together with other medicines that stimulate your ovaries to develop more eggs ready 
to be released. During or after you receive these medicines, you may develop OHSS. This is when 
your follicles develop too much and become large cysts.<br />
For possible signs to look out for and what to do if this happens see section 4  Possible side effects . </p>
<p>Using Cetrotide during more than one cycle 
Experience of using Cetrotide during more than one cycle is small. Your doctor will carefully look at 
the benefits and risks for you, if you need to have Cetrotide during more than one cycle. </p>
<p>Liver disease 
Tell your doctor before using Cetrotide if you have a liver disease. Cetrotide has not been investigated 
in patients with hepatic disease. </p>
<p>Kidney disease 
Tell your doctor before using Cetrotide if you have a kidney disease. Cetrotide has not been 
investigated in patients with kidney disease. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Cetrotide is not indicated for the use in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cetrotide 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Cetrotide if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Cetrotide is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Using this medicine<br />
This medicine is only for injection just under the skin of your belly (subcutaneous). To reduce skin 
irritation, select a different part of your belly each day.<br />
* Your doctor must supervise your first injection. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to 
prepare and inject the medicine. 
* You can carry out the following injections yourself as long as your doctor has made you aware 
of the symptoms that may indicate allergy and of the possibly serious or life-threatening 
consequences that would need immediate treatment (see section 4  Possible side effects ). 
* Please carefully read and follow the instructions at the end of this leaflet called  How to mix and 
inject Cetrotide . 
* You start by using another medicine on day 1 of your treatment cycle. You then start using 
Cetrotide a few days later. (See next section  How much to use ). </p>
<p>How much to use 
Inject the contents of one vial (0.25 mg Cetrotide) once each day. It is best to use the medicine at the 
same time each day, leaving 24 hours between each dose. </p>
<p>You can choose to inject every morning or every evening.<br />
* If you are injecting every morning: Start your injections on day 5 or 6 of the treatment cycle. 
Based on your ovarian response, your doctor may decide to start on another day. Your doctor 
will tell you the exact date and time. You will keep using this medicine up until and including 
the morning that your eggs are collected (ovulation induction). </p>
<p>OR </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are injecting every evening: Start your injections on day 5 of the treatment cycle. Based 
on your ovarian response, your doctor may decide to start on another day. Your doctor will tell 
you the exact date and time. You will keep using this medicine up until and including the 
evening before your eggs are collected (ovulation induction). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more Cetrotide than you should 
Bad effects are not expected if you accidentally inject more of this medicine than you should. The 
effect of the medicine will last for longer. No specific measures are usually required. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Cetrotide 
* If you forget a dose, inject it as soon as you remember and talk to your doctor.<br />
* Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>

<p>Allergic reactions 
- Warm, red skin, itching (often in your groin or armpits), red, itchy, raised areas (hives), runny 
nose, fast or uneven pulse, swelling of your tongue and throat, sneezing, wheezing or serious 
difficulty breathing, or dizziness. You may be having a possible serious, life-threatening allergic 
reaction to the medicine. This is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 women). 
If you notice any of the side effects above, stop using Cetrotide and contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
This may occur due to the other medicines that you are using to stimulate your ovaries. 
- Lower abdominal pain together with feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) may be the 
symptoms of OHSS. This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that 
large ovarian cysts developed. This event is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 women). 
- The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty breathing or fluid in your stomach or chest. This event is uncommon 
(may affect up to 1 in 100 women). 
If you notice any of the side effects above, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Other side effects 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 women): 
* Mild and short-lasting skin irritation may occur at the injection site like redness, itching or 
swelling. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 women): 
* Feeling sick (nausea) 
* Headache. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system

<p>Adding the water from the pre-filled syringe to the powder in the vial </p>
</li>
<li>Unwrap the needle with the yellow mark on it.  </li>
<li>Remove the cap from the pre-filled syringe and screw the yellow needle onto it. Remove 
the cap from the needle. </li>
<li>Push the yellow needle through the centre of the rubber stopper of the vial.  </li>

medicine from the vial into the syringe. Take care not to pull out completely the plunger 
with the attached plunger stopper. In case you pulled out the plunger with the plunger 
stopper by mistake, make sure to discard the dose as sterility will be lost, and prepare a 
new dose (and restart from step 1). </li>
<li>If any medicine is left in the vial, pull out the yellow needle until the end of the needle is 
just inside the rubber stopper. If you look from the side through the gap in the rubber 
stopper, you can control the movement of the needle and the liquid.  </li>
