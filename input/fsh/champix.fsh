<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking CHAMPIX. </p>
<p>There have been reports of depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts in patients 
taking CHAMPIX. If you are taking CHAMPIX and develop agitation, depressed mood, changes in 
behaviour that are of concern to you or your family or if you develop suicidal thoughts or behaviours 
you should stop taking CHAMPIX and contact your doctor immediately for treatment assessment. </p>
<p>The effects of stopping smoking 
The effects of changes in your body resulting from stopping smoking, with or without treatment with 
CHAMPIX, may alter the way other medicines work. Therefore, in some cases an adjustment of the 
dose may be necessary. See below under  Other medicines and CHAMPIX  for further details. </p>
<p>For some people, stopping smoking with or without treatment has been associated with an increased 
risk of experiencing changes in thinking or behaviour, feelings of depression and anxiety and can be 
associated with a worsening of psychiatric disorder. If you have a history of psychiatric disorder you 
should discuss this with your doctor.  </p>
<p>Heart symptoms 
New or worse heart or blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems have been reported primarily in people 
who already have cardiovascular problems. Tell your doctor if you have any changes in symptoms 
during treatment with CHAMPIX. Get emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of a 
heart attack or stroke.  </p>
<p>Seizures 
Tell your doctor if you have experienced seizures or have epilepsy before your start CHAMPIX 
treatment. Some people have reported seizures while taking CHAMPIX.  </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions 
Stop taking CHAMPIX and tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following signs 
and symptoms that may indicate a serious allergic reaction: swelling of the face, lips, tongue, gums, 
throat or body and/or difficulty breathing, wheezing.  </p>
<p>Skin reactions 
Potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Erythema Multiforme) have 
been reported with the use of CHAMPIX. If you develop a rash or if your skin starts to peel or blister 
you should stop taking CHAMPIX and seek emergency medical help. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
CHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients as efficacy was not demonstrated. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CHAMPIX 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In some cases as a result of stopping smoking, with or without CHAMPIX, an adjustment of the dose 
of other medicines may be necessary. Examples include theophylline (a medicine to treat breathing 
problems), warfarin (a medicine to reduce blood clotting), and insulin (a medicine to treat diabetes). If 
in doubt, you should consult your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you have severe kidney disease you should avoid taking cimetidine (a medicine used for gastric 
problems) at the same time as CHAMPIX as this may cause increased blood levels of CHAMPIX.  </p>
<p>Use of CHAMPIX with other therapies for smoking cessation 
Consult your doctor before using CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies. </p>
<p>CHAMPIX with food and drink 
There have been some reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients taking 
CHAMPIX. However, it is not known if CHAMPIX actually increases alcohol intoxication.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
It is preferable to avoid the use of CHAMPIX while you are pregnant. Talk to your doctor if you are 
intending to become pregnant. 
Although it was not studied, CHAMPIX may pass into breast milk. You should ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking CHAMPIX. </p>

CHAMPIX may be linked with dizziness, sleepiness and transient loss of consciousness. You should 
not drive, operate complex machinery or engage in any other potentially hazardous activities until you 
know whether this medicine affects your ability to perform these activities. </p>

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. </p>
<p>You are more likely to stop smoking if you are motivated to stop. Your doctor and pharmacist can 
provide advice, support and sources of further information to help ensure your attempt to stop smoking 
is successful. </p>
<p>Before starting your course of CHAMPIX you should usually decide on a date in the second week of 
treatment (between day 8 and day 14) when you will stop smoking. If you are not willing or able to set 
a target quit date within 2 weeks, you may choose your own target quit date within 5 weeks after 
starting treatment. You should write this date on the pack as a reminder.  </p>
<p>CHAMPIX comes as a white tablet (0.5 mg) and a light blue tablet (1 mg). You start with the white 
tablet and then usually go to the light blue tablet. See the chart below for the usual dosing instructions 
which you should follow from Day 1. Week 1 
Dose 
Day 1 - 3 
From day 1 to day 3, you should take one white CHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablet once 
a day. </p>
<p>Day 4 - 7 
From day 4 to day 7, you should take one white CHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablet twice 
daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. </p>
<p>Week 2 </p>
<p>Day 8   From day 8 to day 14, you should take one light blue CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablet 
twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. </p>
<p>Weeks 3 - Day 15 -<br />
end of 
treatment 
From day 15 until the end of treatment, you should take one light blue CHAMPIX 1 mg 
film-coated tablet twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the 
same time each day. </p>
<p>After 12 weeks of treatment, if you have stopped smoking, your doctor may recommend an additional 
12 weeks of treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablets twice daily to help avoid returning 
back to smoking. </p>
<p>If you are not able or willing to quit smoking straight away, you should reduce smoking during the 
first 12 weeks of treatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. You should then continue to 
take CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablets twice daily for a further 12 weeks resulting in a total of 
24 weeks of treatment. </p>
<p>Should you experience adverse effects that you cannot tolerate your doctor may decide to reduce your 
dose temporarily or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily.  </p>
<p>If you have problems with your kidneys, you should speak to your doctor before taking CHAMPIX. 
You may need a lower dose. </p>
<p>Champix is for oral use. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more CHAMPIX than you should 
If you accidentally take more CHAMPIX than your doctor prescribed, you must seek medical advice 
or go to the nearest hospital casualty department immediately. Take your box of tablets with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take CHAMPIX<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. It is important that you take CHAMPIX 
regularly at the same time each day. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If, it 
is within 3-4 hours before your next dose, do not take the tablet that you have missed.  </p>
<p>If you stop taking CHAMPIX 
It has been shown in clinical trials that taking all doses of your medicine at the appropriate times and 
for the recommended duration of treatment described above will increase your chances of stopping 
smoking. Therefore, unless your doctor instructs you to stop treatment, it is important to keep taking 
CHAMPIX, according to the instructions described in the table above. </p>
<p>In smoking cessation therapy, risk of returning to smoking may be elevated in the period immediately 
following the end of treatment. You may temporarily experience increased irritability, urge to smoke, 
depression and/or sleep disturbances when you stop taking CHAMPIX. Your doctor may decide to 
gradually lower your dose of CHAMPIX at the end of treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
