in the digestion of fat and vitamins from food. Patients with a rare condition known as 
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) cannot produce chenodeoxycholic acid and this causes a 
build-up of fatty deposits in various areas of the body. This can cause damage to the affected areas. </p>
<p>Chenodeoxycholic acid Leadiant capsules treats CTX by replacing the chenodeoxycholic acid, which 
prevents the build-up of the fatty deposits. </p>
<p>Chenodeoxycholic acid Leadiant capsules can be used from the age of one month and patients with
