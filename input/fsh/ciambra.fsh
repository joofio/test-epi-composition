<ul>
<li>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to pemetrexed or any of the other ingredients of CIAMBRA 
(listed in section 6). </li>
<li>if you are breast-feeding; you must discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with 
CIAMBRA. </li>
<li>if you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving CIAMBRA. 
If you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or 
hospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive CIAMBRA. 
Before each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient 
kidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive CIAMBRA. Your 
doctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition and if 
your blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make sure that 
you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving cisplatin to 
prevent vomiting. </p>
<p>If you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early 
or late radiation reaction with CIAMBRA. </p>
<p>If you have been recently vaccinated, please tell your doctor, as this can possibly cause bad effects 
with CIAMBRA. </p>
<p>If you have heart disease or a history of heart disease, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have an accumulation of fluid around your lungs, your doctor may decide to remove the fluid 
before giving you CIAMBRA. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>CIAMBRA is not to be given to children and adolescents because no studies were performed in these 
groups. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CIAMBRA </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as 
medicines called  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs), including medicines purchased 
without a doctor s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There are many sorts of NSAIDs with different 
durations of activity. Based on the planned date of your infusion of CIAMBRA and/or on the status of 
your kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you 
can take them. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are NSAIDs. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. The 
use of CIAMBRA should be avoided during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the 
potential risk of taking CIAMBRA during pregnancy. Women must use effective contraception during 
treatment with CIAMBRA and for 6 months after receiving the last dose. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. 
Breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with CIAMBRA. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>Men are advised not to father a child during and up to  3 months following treatment with CIAMBRA 
and should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with CIAMBRA and for up to  3 
months afterwards. If you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the  3 months 
following receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. CIAMBRA can affect 
your ability to have children. Talk to your doctor to seek advice about sperm storage before starting 
your therapy.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>CIAMBRA may make you feel tired. Be careful when driving a car or using machines. </p>
<p>CIAMBRA contains sodium </p>
<p>CIAMBRA 100 mg contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . 
CIAMBRA 500 mg contains 54 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 2.7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

and weight are measured to work out the surface area of your body. Your doctor will use this body 
surface area to work out the right dose for you. This dose may be adjusted, or treatment may be 
delayed depending on your blood cell counts and on your general condition. A hospital pharmacist, 
nurse or doctor will have mixed the CIAMBRA powder with 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) sodium chloride 
solution for injection before it is given to you. </p>
<p>You will always receive CIAMBRA by infusion into one of your veins. The infusion will last 
approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p>When using CIAMBRA in combination with cisplatin: 
The doctor or hospital pharmacist will work out the dose you need based on your height and weight. 
Cisplatin is also given by infusion into one of your veins, and is given approximately 30 minutes after 
the infusion of CIAMBRA has finished. The infusion of cisplatin will last approximately 2 hours. </p>
<p>You should usually receive your infusion once every 3 weeks. </p>
<p>Additional medicines: 
Corticosteroids: your doctor will prescribe you steroid tablets (equivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone 
twice a day) that you will need to take on the day before, on the day of, and the day after CIAMBRA 
treatment. This medicine is given to you to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions that 
you may experience during your anticancer treatment. </p>
<p>Vitamin supplementation: your doctor will prescribe you oral folic acid (vitamin) or a multivitamin 
containing folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) that you must take once a day while you are taking 
CIAMBRA. You must take at least 5 doses during the seven days before the first dose of CIAMBRA. 
You must continue taking the folic acid for 21 days after the last dose of CIAMBRA. You will also 
receive an injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before administration of 
CIAMBRA and then approximately every 9 weeks (corresponding to 3 courses of CIAMBRA 
treatment). Vitamin B12 and folic acid are given to you to reduce the possible toxic effects of the 
anticancer treatment. </p>
