kinase inhibitors, which help to reduce inflammation. It works by reducing the activity of an enzyme 
in the body called  Janus kinase , which is involved in inflammation.  </p>
<p>Cibinqo is used to treat adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. 
By reducing the activity of Janus kinase enzymes, Cibinqo lessens itching and inflammation of the 
skin. This in turn can reduce sleep disturbances and other consequences of atopic eczema such as 
anxiety or depression and improves overall quality of life.   </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to abrocitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have a serious infection ongoing, including tuberculosis. 
- if you have severe liver problems. 
- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see the  pregnancy, contraception, breast-feeding and 
fertility  section). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before and during treatment with Cibinqo if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an infection or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as 
fever, wounds, feeling more tired than usual or dental problems as these can be signs of 
infection. Cibinqo can reduce your body s ability to fight infections and may make an existing 
infection worse or increase the chance of you getting a new infection. If you have diabetes or 
are aged 65 years or older you may have an increased chance of getting infections. </li>
<li>have, or have had, tuberculosis or have been in close contact with someone with tuberculosis. 
Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before starting Cibinqo and may retest during 
treatment. </li>
<li>have ever had a herpes infection (shingles), because Cibinqo may allow it to come back. Tell 
your doctor if you get a painful skin rash with blisters as this can be a sign of shingles. </li>
<li>have ever had hepatitis B or hepatitis C. </li>
<li>have recently had or plan to have a vaccination (immunisation) - this is because certain vaccines 
(live vaccines) are not recommended while using Cibinqo.  </li>
<li>have previously had blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs 
(pulmonary embolism) or have an increased risk for developing this (for example: if you had 
recent major surgery, if you use hormonal contraceptives\hormonal replacement therapy, if a 
coagulation defect is identified in you or your close relatives). Your doctor will discuss with you 
if Cibinqo is appropriate for you. Tell your doctor if you get sudden shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, chest pain or pain in upper back, swelling of the leg or arm, leg pain or 
tenderness, or redness or discoloration in the leg or arm as these can be signs of blood clots in 
the veins. </li>
<li>have, or had heart problems because your doctor will discuss with you if Cibinqo is appropriate 
for you.  </li>
<li>have or have had cancer, smoke or have smoked in the past, because your doctor will discuss 
with you if Cibinqo is appropriate for you. </li>
<li>Non-melanoma skin cancer has been observed in patients taking Cibinqo. Your doctor may 
recommend that you have regular skin examinations while taking Cibinqo. If new skin lesions 
appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional monitoring tests 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before and during Cibinqo treatment and may adjust your 
treatment if necessary. </p>
<p>Children<br />
This medicine is not approved for use in children below the age of 18 years because the safety and 
benefits of Cibinqo are not yet fully established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cibinqo<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cibinqo if you are taking some of the 
medicines to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>fungal infections (such as fluconazole), depression (such as fluoxetine or fluvoxamine), stroke 
(such as ticlopidine), as they may increase the side effects of Cibinqo. </li>
<li>stomach acid reflux (such as antacids, famotidine or omeprazole), as they may reduce the 
amount of Cibinqo in your blood. </li>
<li>depression (such as citalopram, clobazam or escitalopram), as Cibinqo may increase their 
effects.  </li>
<li>neurofibromatosis type I (such as selumetinib), as Cibinqo may increase its effects. </li>
<li>heart failure (such as digoxin) or stroke (such as dabigatran), as Cibinqo may increase their 
effects.  </li>
<li>seizures (such a S-mephenytoin), as Cibinqo may increase its effects. </li>
<li>stroke (such as clopidogrel), as Cibinqo may decrease its effects. </li>
<li>asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or atopic dermatitis (such as biologic antibody therapies, 
medicines that control the body s immune response such as ciclosporin, other Janus kinase 
inhibitors, such as baricitinib, upadacitinib), as they may increase the risk of side effects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor can tell you to avoid using or stop taking Cibinqo if you are taking some of the medicines 
to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>tuberculosis (such as rifampicin), seizures or fits (such as phenytoin), prostate cancer (such as 
apalutamide, enzalutamide), or HIV infection (such as efavirenz), as these may reduce how well 
Cibinqo works. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above apply to you or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Cibinqo. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Contraception in women 
If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you should use an effective method of contraception 
during treatment with Cibinqo, and for at least one month after your last treatment dose. Your doctor 
can advise you on suitable methods of contraception.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not use Cibinqo if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby 
since it can harm the developing baby. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant or think 
you might have become pregnant during treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not use Cibinqo while breast-feeding as it is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk and 
affects the baby. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use this medicine. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Cibinqo may cause temporary reduced fertility in woman of childbearing potential. This effect is 
reversible after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Cibinqo has no effect on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Cibinqo contains lactose monohydrate and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>
<p>Elderly 
Patients aged 65 years and older may be at increased risk of infections, heart attack and some types of 
cancer. Your doctor may decide that Cibinqo is not suitable for you. </p>         </div>"""

on the skin or it may be used on its own. </p>
<p>The recommended starting dose is 100 mg or 200 mg once a day as prescribed by your doctor. Your 
doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on how well the medicine is working. Some 
patients need a lower starting dose and your doctor may give you 100 mg once a day if you are 
65 years of age or older, or if you have a certain medical history or medical condition. If you have 
moderate-to-severe kidney problems, or if you are prescribed certain other medicines the starting dose 
can be either 50 mg or 100 mg once a day. You will get a starting dose based on your need and 
medical history or medical condition, therefore you should always take this medicine exactly as your 
doctor has told you. </p>
<p>After starting treatment, your doctor can adjust the dose based on how well the medicine works and 
any side effect you get. If the medicine is working well, the dose may be reduced. Treatment may also 
be stopped temporarily or permanently if blood tests show low white blood cell or platelet counts. </p>
<p>If you have taken Cibinqo for 24 weeks and still show no improvement, your doctor may decide to 
permanently stop the treatment. </p>
<p>You should swallow your tablet whole with water. Do not split, crush or chew the tablet before 
swallowing as it may change how much medicine that gets into your body.  </p>

medicine, it may help to take it with food. To help you remember to take your medicine, it is
