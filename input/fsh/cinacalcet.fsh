  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Cinacalcet Accordpharma contains the active ingredient cinacalcet, which works by controlling the 
levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorous in your body. It is used to treat 
problems with organs called parathyroid glands. The parathyroids are four small glands in the neck, 
near the thyroid gland, that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). </p>
<p>Cinacalcet Accordpharma is used in adults: 
- to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with serious kidney disease who need dialysis 
to clear their blood of waste products. 
- to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with parathyroid 
cancer. 
- to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with primary 
hyperparathyroidism when removal of the gland is not possible. </p>
<p>Cinacalcet Accordpharma is used in children aged 3 years to less than 18 years of age: 
- to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who need 
dialysis to clear their blood of waste products, whose condition is not controlled with 
other treatments. </p>
<p>In primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism too much PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands. 
“Primary” means that the hyperparathyroidism is not caused by any other condition and “secondary” 
means that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, e.g. kidney disease. Both primary 
and secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause the loss of calcium in the bones, which can lead to bone 
pain and fractures, problems with blood and heart vessels, kidney stones, mental illness and coma. </p>         </div>"""
