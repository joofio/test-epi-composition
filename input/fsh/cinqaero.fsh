  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What CINQAERO is 
CINQAERO contains the active substance reslizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that 
recognises and binds to a specific target substance in the body. </p>
<p>What CINQAERO is used for 
CINQAERO is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adult patients (18 years of age and over) 
when the condition is not well controlled despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
together with another asthma medicine. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma where patients have 
too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. CINQAERO is used together with other medicines to treat 
asthma (inhaled corticosteroids plus other asthma medicines). </p>
<p>How CINQAERO works 
CINQAERO blocks interleukin-5 activity and reduces the number of eosinophils in your blood and 
lungs. Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. Interleukin-5 is a protein 
your body makes that plays a key role in inflammation in asthma by activating eosinophils. </p>
<p>What are the benefits of using CINQAERO 
CINQAERO reduces how often you have flare-ups of your asthma, helps you breathe better and 
decreases your asthma symptoms. </p>         </div>"""
