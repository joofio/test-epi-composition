prevent bleeding in patients with hereditary factor X deficiency, including during surgery.  </p>

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to human coagulation factor X or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).<br />
Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Coagadex:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a larger or longer bleed than usual and the bleeding does not stop after an injection of 
Coagadex. </li>
<li>if you are taking a medicine to prevent blood clotting that works by blocking clotting factor Xa. These 
medicines may prevent Coagadex from working. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some patients with a shortage of factor X may develop inhibitors (antibodies) to factor X during treatment. 
This could mean that the treatment will not work properly. Your doctor will check regularly for the 
development of these antibodies, and especially before an operation. Both before and after treatment with this 
medicine, particularly for your first course of treatment, your doctor will probably carry out tests to check the 
level of factor X in your blood. </p>
<p>Virus safety 
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to recipients. These include: </p>
<p>careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, 
  the testing of donated plasma for signs of virus/infections, 
  the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. </p>
<p>The measures taken are considered effective for the following viruses: human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. Despite these measures, 
when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on an 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of 
infections. </p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Coagadex, the name and batch number of 
the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. </p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you regularly or 
repeatedly receive human plasma-derived factor X products. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The listed warnings and precautions for adults also apply to children (aged 2 to 11 years) and adolescents 
(aged 12 to 18 years). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Coagadex 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There are no known effects of this medicine on the ability to drive or operate machinery. </p>
<p>Coagadex contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 9.2 mg sodium (the main component of cooking/table salt) in each millilitre of 
solution. This is equivalent to 0.0046% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Your treatment should be initiated by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of bleeding disorders. </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Coagadex should be injected directly into a vein. Before injecting this medicine at home, you should have 
received training by your healthcare professional on how to do so.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will explain to you how much you should use, when you should use it and for how long. Your 
doctor will usually tell you your dose in terms of the number of full vials that supply the dose most suited to 
you. Not more than 60 IU/kg daily should be administered in any age group. </p>
<p>Use in adults </p>
<p>How much Coagadex is given to treat a bleed or prevent further bleeding? 
Your doctor will tell you how much Coagadex to administer to treat a bleed and to prevent further bleeding; 
the dose required will depend on your normal blood level of factor X </p>
<p>How much is given before, during and after major surgery? 
Before: The dose of Coagadex used should be sufficient to raise your blood factor X level to between 70 and 
90 units/dL. The dose you need will depend on your normal blood level of factor X and will be calculated by 
your doctor. </p>
<p>After: During the first few days after the operation, your plasma factor X concentration will be checked 
regularly. It is recommended that your blood factor X level is kept above 50 units/dL. The dose you need 
will be calculated by your doctor. </p>
<p>If your blood factor X concentration is too low (this will be tested by your doctor), or if it decreases faster 
than expected, an inhibitor to factor X may be present which stops the medicine from working properly. 
Your doctor will arrange for the appropriate laboratory tests to see if this is the case. </p>
<p>How much is given regularly for long-term prevention of bleeds? 
Your doctor will advise if this use is suitable for you and, if so, of the appropriate dose. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Your doctor will recommend an appropriate dose for you or your child. Doses for children less than 12 years 
old are generally larger than for adolescents and adults. Doses for adolescents will be similar to those for 
adults. </p>
<p>When to inject Coagadex 
* The medicine should be injected when the first sign of bleeding occurs. 
* The injection should be repeated as necessary to stop the bleeding. 
* Each individual bleed should be judged on its own severity. 
* If you are using this medicine for the first time, your doctor will supervise you. </p>
<p>Dissolving your medicines before use 
Your medicine must only be dissolved in the solvent provided with the product. </p>
<p>Quantity of Coagadex 
Volume of solvent 
250 IU 
2.5 mL 
500 IU 
5 mL </p>
<p>Coagadex is supplied with the amount of solvent as shown in the table. </p>
<p>You can dissolve this medicine using the needle-free Mix2Vial transfer device included within each pack.<br />
Bring the containers of Coagadex to room temperature before mixing. 
Make up the medicine as follows: </p>
<p>Step 1 
  Remove the cap from the powder vial and clean the top of the 
stopper with an alcohol swab. 
  Repeat this step with the vial of solvent. 
  Peel back the top of the transfer device package but leave the device in the 
package. </p>
<p>Step 2 
  Place the blue end of the transfer device on the solvent vial and push straight 
down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and snaps into place. 
  Remove the plastic outer packaging from the transfer device and discard it, 
taking care not to touch the exposed end of the device. </p>
<p>Step 3 
  Turn the solvent vial upside down with the device still attached. 
  Place the clear end of the transfer device on the powder vial and push 
straight down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and snaps into 
place. </p>
<p>Step 4 
  The solvent will be pulled into the powder vial by the vacuum contained 
within it. 
  Gently swirl the vial to make sure the powder is thoroughly mixed. Do not 
shake the vial. 
  A colourless, clear or slightly pearl-like solution should be obtained, usually 
in about 1 minute (5 minutes maximum). </p>
<p>Step 5 
  Separate the empty solvent vial and blue part of the transfer device from the 
clear part by unscrewing anti-clockwise. 
  Take an empty syringe (not provided in the Coagadex pack) and draw air 
into it by pulling the plunger to match the required volume of water added in 
step 4.   Connect the syringe to the clear part of the transfer device and push the air 
in the syringe into the vial. </p>
<p>Step 6 
  Immediately invert the vial of solution, which will be drawn into the 
syringe. 
  Disconnect the filled syringe from the device. 
  The product is now ready for use. Follow the normal safety practices for 
administration. Make sure you use the product within an hour after it has been 
made up. </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if the solvent is not pulled into the vial (this indicates loss of vacuum in the vial, so the 
powder must not be used). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the dissolved powder and solvent form a gel or a clot (if this happens please tell your healthcare 
provider, reporting the batch number printed on the vial). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more Coagadex than you should 
If you administer more of this medicine than your doctor prescribed, it is possible you might develop a blood 
clot. If you think you may be using too much, stop the injection and tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse. If 
you know you have used too much, tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Coagadex 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Inject your normal dose as you remember and then 
continue dosing as instructed by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop using Coagadex 
Always consult your doctor before deciding to stop your treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
