<p>Colobreathe is used to control persistent lung infections caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa in adult patients and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa is a very common bacterium that infects nearly all cystic fibrosis patients at some time 
during their lives. Some people will get this infection whilst very young but for others it will be much 
later. If this infection is not properly controlled it will cause damage to the lungs.  </p>
<p>How it works 
Colobreathe works by destroying the bacterial cell membrane, having a lethal effect on them.  </p>         </div>"""

• if you/your child are allergic to colistimethate sodium, colistin sulphate or polymyxins. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Colobreathe. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you/your child has ever had any of the following conditions 
• have reacted badly to inhaled dry powder medicines previously unless this has already been 
discussed with your doctor. 
• already have a muscle condition known as myasthenia gravis or the inherited condition, 
porphyria 
• blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up) </p>
<p>After each inhalation of Colobreathe, the mouth should be rinsed with water. The rinse should not be 
swallowed. Rinsing may reduce the risk of developing oral fungal super-infection during treatment 
and may also reduce the unpleasant taste associated with colistimethate sodium. </p>
<p>When you/your child start using Colobreathe, you/your child may find they have cough, 
breathlessness, tightness of chest or wheezing. The number of these side-effects may reduce as you 
continue to use the inhaler or your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator to use before or after taking 
Colobreathe. If any of these effects become a problem, please contact your doctor who may change 
your treatment. </p>
<p>If you/your child has any problems with your kidneys or nerves, care should be taken when 
administering Colobreathe but your doctor should be aware of this. </p>
<p>If you/your child needs to have other forms of colistimethate either by injection or nebulisation 
caution should be used but your doctor should be aware of this. </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give Colobreathe to children under the age of 6 years as it is not suitable for them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Colobreathe 
Tell your doctor if you/your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
and in particular: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you/your child are taking aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat infections caution must be 
taken; </li>
<li>if you/your child suffer from myasthenia gravis and are taking macrolide type antibiotics such 
as azithromycin and clarithromycin, or fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin and 
ciprofloxacin. Taking these at the same time as Colobreathe may cause problems with muscle 
weakness; </li>
<li>if you/your child are taking colistimethate by injection or nebulisation caution must be taken; </li>
<li>if you/your child need to have a general anaesthetic caution must be taken. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>There is no information about the safety of Colobreathe in pregnant women. Your doctor should 
advise you before using Colobreathe whether the benefits of the medicine exceed the risks. </p>
<p>Colistimethate sodium may be secreted in the breast milk. Please discuss the use of Colobreathe with 
your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is possible while using Colobreathe that you may experience dizziness, confusion or have problems 
with your sight. Do not drive or use any machines until the symptoms have gone away. </p>
<p>Colobreathe contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
