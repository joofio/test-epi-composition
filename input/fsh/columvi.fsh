<p>Columvi is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance glofitamab. </p>
<p>What Columvi is used for </p>
<p>Columvi is used to treat adults with a cancer called  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  (DLBCL). It is 
used when the cancer: 
* has come back (relapsed), or<br />
* did not respond to previous treatments.  </p>
<p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of a part of your immune system (the body s defences). 
* It affects a type of white blood cell called  B cells .<br />
* In DLBCL, B cells multiply in an uncontrolled manner and build up in your tissues. </p>
<p>How Columvi works </p>
<ul>
<li>The active substance in Columvi, glofitamab, is a bispecific monoclonal antibody, a type of 
protein that attaches to two specific targets in the body. It attaches to a specific protein on the 
surface of B cells, including cancerous B cells, and also to another protein on the surface of T 
cells (another type of white blood cell). This activates T cells and causes them to multiply. This, 
in turn, results in the destruction of the B cells, including the cancerous cells. </li>

section 6) </li>
<li>if you are allergic to obinutuzumab, which is another medicine given before starting Columvi 
treatment (see also section 3  How Columvi is given ), or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
Columvi. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you are given Columvi if 
* you have an infection 
* you have had a long-lasting infection (chronic), or an infection which keeps coming back 
(recurring)<br />
<em> you have or had any kidney, liver or heart problems<br />
</em> you are planning to have a vaccine in the near future </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given Columvi.  </p>
<p>Pay attention to serious side effects.  </p>
<p>Some side effects of Columvi are serious and can be life-threatening. These may happen any time 
during Columvi treatment. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you experience any of the following side effects while receiving 
Columvi. The symptoms of each side effect are listed in section 4. * Cytokine release syndrome: an exaggerated inflammatory condition associated with medicines 
that stimulate T cells, characterized by fever and impairment to multiple organs in the body. 
Cytokine release syndrome is more likely to occur during Cycle 1 after Columvi is given (see 
section 3  How Columvi is given ). Close monitoring is needed. Before each infusion, you may 
be given medicines, which help reduce possible side effects of cytokine release syndrome.<br />
* Tumour lysis syndrome: some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood (such 
as potassium and uric acid)   caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. 
Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each infusion, you 
should be well-hydrated and may be given medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric 
acid. These may help reduce possible side effects of tumour lysis syndrome. 
* Tumour flare: a reaction to certain medicines that act on the immune system which is/appears 
similar to worsening of the cancer. 
* Infections: you may get signs of infection, which can vary depending on where in the body the 
infection is. </p>
<p>If you have, or think you may have, any of the above symptoms tell your doctor straight away.<br />
Your doctor may:<br />
<em> give you other medicines to reduce symptoms and prevent complications, 
* stop your treatment for a short time, or<br />
</em> stop your treatment completely.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because 
Columvi has not been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Columvi </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might start taking any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and contraception </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. </li>
<li>You should not be given Columvi if you are pregnant. This is because it is possible that Columvi 
could harm your unborn baby. </li>
<li>If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception while you are being treated 
with Columvi and for 2 months after the last dose. </li>
<li>If you become pregnant while you are being treated with Columvi tell your doctor immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while receiving Columvi and for at least 2 months after the last dose. This is 
because it is not known if this medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Columvi has minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines.  </p>
<p>If you feel any symptoms that may affect your ability to drive, including symptoms of cytokine release 
syndrome (such as fever, fast heartbeat, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, chills or shortness of breath)   do 
not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you feel better. See section 4 for more information 
about side effects. </p>         </div>"""

hospital or clinic. </p>
<p>Medicines given before Columvi treatment </p>
<ul>
<li>Seven days before starting Columvi treatment, you will be given another medicine, 
obinutuzumab, to reduce the number of B cells in your blood.  </li>
<li>
<p>30 to 60 minutes before you are given Columvi, you may be given other medicines 
(pre-medication) to help reduce reactions associated with cytokine release syndrome. These 
medicines may include:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A corticosteroid such as dexamethasone </p>
</li>
<li>A fever-reducing medicine such as paracetamol </li>
<li>An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine </li>
</ul>
<p>How much and how often you will receive Columvi  </p>
<p>You may be given up to 12 treatment cycles of Columvi. Each cycle lasts 21 days. During the first two 
cycles, your doctor will begin Columvi treatment with a low dose and will gradually increase it to the 
full dose. </p>
<p>A typical schedule is shown below.  </p>
<p>Cycle 1: This will include a pre-treatment and 2 low doses of Columvi during the 21 days: 
* Day 1   Pre-treatment with obinutuzumab 
* Day 8   2.5 mg starting dose of Columvi 
* Day 15   10 mg intermediate dose of Columvi </p>
<p>Cycle 2 to Cycle 12: This will be just one dose in the 21 days: 
* Day 1   30 mg full dose of Columvi </p>
<p>How Columvi is given and monitoring </p>
<p>Columvi is given as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion). Your doctor will adjust the time 
required for infusion depending on how you respond to treatment. 
* Your first infusion will be given over 4 hours. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during the 
first infusion and for 10 hours after completion of infusion. This is to watch for any signs or 
symptoms of cytokine release syndrome.<br />
* For following infusions, your doctor may require to monitor you after completion of infusion. 
This will be necessary if you have had moderate or severe cytokine release syndrome with your 
previous dose. 
* If you do not have any cytokine release syndrome after 3 doses, your doctor may give the 
following infusions over 2 hours. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Columvi </p>
<p>If you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it 
is very important not to miss a dose. </p>
<p>Before stopping Columvi treatment </p>
<p>Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. This is because stopping treatment may make your 
condition worse. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
