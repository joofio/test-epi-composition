in section 6)  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: 
* you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. 
* you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
* you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination 
if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
* you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
* you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine 
such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. </p>
<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  </p>
<p>As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how 
long you will be protected. </p>
<p>The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are 
immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, you should 
continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts 
should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Children 
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for 
children aged under 12 years. </p>
<p>There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. </p>
<p>The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Comirnaty 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. </p>
<p>Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women 
vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on 
the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby 
after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been 
seen.  </p>
<p>Comirnaty can be given during breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or 
use machines. </p>
<p>Comirnaty contains potassium and sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 potassium-free . </p>
<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
