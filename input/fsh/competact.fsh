type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus when treatment with metformin alone is not 
sufficient. This type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood particularly as a result of the person 
being overweight and where the body either does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that controls 
blood sugar levels), or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Your doctor will check whether 
Competact is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. </p>
<p>Competact helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by helping 
your body make better use of the insulin it produces. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to pioglitazone, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past. 
- if you recently had a heart attack, have severe circulatory problems including shock, or 
breathing difficulties. 
- if you have liver disease. 
- if you drink alcohol excessively (either every day or only from time to time). 
- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with for example severe hyperglycaemia (high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see section Risk of 
lactic acidosis ) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called 'ketone 
bodies' accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell. 
- if you have or have ever had bladder cancer. 
- if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. 
- if you have severely reduced kidney function. 
- if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated. 
- if you are going to have a certain type of X-ray with an injectable dye, talk to your doctor as you 
must stop taking Competact for a certain period of time before and after the examination. 
- if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Competact (see also section 4). 
- if you have a problem with your heart. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin 
together experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if 
you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in 
weight or localised swelling (oedema).<br />
- if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems in particular if you are over 
75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and 
swelling, you must also tell your doctor. 
- if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back 
of the eye), talk to your doctor if you notice any change to your vision. 
- if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased 
possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Competact. If 
this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned 
pregnancy. 
- if you have a problem with your liver. Before you start taking Competact you will have a blood 
sample taken to check your liver function. This check should be repeated at intervals. Inform 
your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms suggesting a problem with your liver 
(like feeling sick without explanations, vomiting, stomach ache, tiredness, loss of appetite 
and/or dark urine) as your liver function should be checked.  </p>
<p>You may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). </p>
<p>Risk of lactic acidosis 
Competact may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your 
kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with 
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further 
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a 
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).<br />
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Competact for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Competact and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you 
experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma.<br />
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>vomiting </li>
<li>stomach ache (abdominal pain) </li>
<li>muscle cramps </li>
<li>a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness </li>
<li>difficulty in breathing </li>
<li>reduced body temperature and heartbeat </li>
</ul>
<p>Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. </p>
<p>During treatment with Competact, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or 
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function. </p>
<p>If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Competact during and for some time after the 
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Competact. </p>
<p>Hypoglycaemia 
If you take Competact with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood sugar could 
fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). If you experience symptoms of hypoglycaemia such as 
weakness, dizziness, increased sweating, fast heart-beating, vision disorders or difficulty in 
concentration, you should take some sugar to increase your blood sugar level again. Ask your doctor 
or pharmacist for more information if you are not sure how to recognise this. It is recommended that 
you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice </p>
<p>Broken bones 
A higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your 
doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Competact 
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Competact before or at the time of 
the injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Competact. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may 
need to adjust the dose of Competact. It is especially important to mention the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) </li>
<li>rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) </li>
<li>cimetidine (used to reduce stomach acid) </li>
<li>glucocorticoids (used to treat inflammation) </li>
<li>beta-2-agonists (used to treat asthma) </li>
<li>medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) </li>
<li>medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as 
ibuprofen and celecoxib) </li>
<li>certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Competact with alcohol 
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Competact since this may increase the risk of lactic 
acidosis (see section  Risk of lactic acidosis ). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have 
a baby. Competact is not recommended in pregnancy. If you wish to become pregnant, your 
doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. 
- do not use Competact if you are breastfeeding or are planning to breast-feed (see section  Do 
not take Competact ). </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine will not affect your ability to drive or use machines but take care if you experience 
abnormal vision. </p>
<p>Competact contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose is one tablet taken twice daily. If necessary your doctor may tell you to take a 
different dose. If you have reduced kidney function, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose, which 
may need to be given as separate tablets of pioglitazone and metformin. </p>
<p>You should swallow the tablets with a glass of water. You may take your tablets with or just after food

<p>If you are following a special diet for diabetes, you should continue with this while you are taking 
Competact. </p>
<p>Your weight should be checked at regular intervals; if your weight increases, inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to have blood tests periodically during treatment with Competact. This is to 
check that your liver is working normally. At least once a year (more often if you are elderly or have 
kidney problems) your doctor will check that your kidneys are working normally. </p>
<p>If you take more Competact than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, talk to a 
doctor or pharmacist immediately. Your blood sugar could fall below the normal level and can be 
increased by taking sugar. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or 
sugary fruit juice. 
If you have taken more Competact that you should have, you may experience lactic acidosis (see 
section  Risk of lactic acidosis ). </p>
<p>If you forget to take Competact 
Take Competact daily as prescribed. However if you miss a dose, skip the missed dose and just carry 
on with the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Competact 
Competact should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using Competact, your blood sugar 
may go up. Talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
