Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Comtess:</p>
<p>if you have ever had a heart attack or any other diseases of the heart;</p>
<p>if you are taking a medicine which may cause dizziness or light-headedness (low blood 
pressure) when rising from a chair or bed;</p>
<p>if you experience prolonged diarrhoea consult your doctor as it may be a sign of inflammation 
of the colon;</p>
<p>if you experience diarrhoea, monitoring of your weight is recommended in order to avoid 
potentially excessive weight loss;</p>
<p>if you experience increasing loss of appetite, weakness, exhaustion and weight loss within a 
relatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be 
considered.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in 
ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain 
activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders 
and can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a 
preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your 
treatments.
As Comtess tablets will be taken together with other levodopa medicines, please also read the package 
leaflets of these medicines carefully.
The dose of other medicines to treat Parkinson s disease may need to be adjusted when you start 
taking Comtess. Follow the instructions that your doctor has given you.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a serious but rare reaction to certain medicines, and may 
occur especially when Comtess and other medicines to treat Parkinson s disease are suddenly stopped 
or the dose is suddenly reduced. For the characteristics of NMS see Section 4 Possible side effects. 
Your doctor may advise you to slowly discontinue the treatment with Comtess and other medicines to 
treat Parkinson s disease.
Comtess taken with levodopa may cause drowsiness and may cause you to sometimes suddenly fall 
asleep. If this happens, you should not drive or use any tools or machines (see Driving and using 
machines).
Other medicines and Comtess
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular please tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following:</p>
<p>rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, 
apomorphine;</p>
<p>antidepressants including desipramine, maprotiline, venlafaxine, paroxetine;</p>
<p>warfarin used to thin the blood;</p>
<p>iron supplements. Comtess may make it harder for you to digest iron. Therefore, do not take 
Comtess and iron supplements at the same time. After taking one of them, wait at least 2 to 3
hours before taking the other.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
Do not use Comtess during pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Comtess taken together with levodopa may lower your blood pressure, which may make you feel 
light-headed or dizzy. Be particularly careful when you drive or when you use tools or machinery.
In addition, Comtess taken with levodopa may make you feel very drowsy, or cause you to 
sometimes suddenly fall asleep.
Do not drive or operate machinery if you experience these side effects.
Comtess contains soya lecithin and sodium
Comtess contains soya lecithin. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicinal 
product.
This medicine contains 7.9 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each tablet. The 
maximum recommended daily dose (10 tablets) contains 79 mg of sodium. This is equivalent to 4% 
of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

Comtess is taken together with medicines containing levodopa (either levodopa/carbidopa 
preparations or levodopa/benserazide preparations). You may also use other medicines to treat 
Parkinson s disease at the same time.
The recommended dose of Comtess is one 200 mg tablet with each levodopa dose. The maximum 
recommended dose is 10 tablets per day, i.e. 2,000 mg of Comtess.

and then press with your thumb on the seal until it 
breaks. See picture 1. Picture 1
Use in children and adolescents
Experience with Comtess in patients under 18 years is limited. Therefore, the use of Comtess in 
children or adolescents cannot be recommended.
If you take more Comtess than you should
In the event of an overdose, consult your doctor, pharmacist or the nearest hospital immediately.
If you forget to take Comtess
If you forget to take the Comtess tablet with your levodopa dose, you should continue the treatment 
by taking the next Comtess tablet with your next levodopa dose.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.
If you stop taking Comtess
Do not stop taking Comtess unless your doctor tells you to.
When stopping your doctor may need to re-adjust the dosage of your other medicines to treat 
Parkinson s disease. Suddenly stopping Comtess and other medicines to treat Parkinson s disease
may result in unwanted side effects. See Section 2 Warnings and precautions.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
