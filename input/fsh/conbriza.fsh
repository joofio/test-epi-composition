<p>if you are allergic to bazedoxifene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>if you have or have had a blood clot (for example, in the blood vessels in your legs, lungs, or 
eyes). </p>
<p>if you are pregnant or could still become pregnant. This medicine may cause harm to your 
unborn child if taken during pregnancy. </p>
<p>if you have any unexplained vaginal bleeding. This must be investigated by your doctor. </p>
<p>if you have active uterine cancer. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking CONBRIZA </p>
<p>as it may increase your risk of getting blood clots. While very infrequent, these clots can cause 
serious medical problems, disability or death. Speak with your doctor to see if you are at 
increased risk for blood clots. </p>
<p>if you are immobile (unable to move) for some time, such as being wheel-chair bound, sitting for 
a prolonged period of time or having to stay in bed while recovering from an operation or 
illness. If you are traveling on long trips, you should walk around or exercise your legs and feet 
at regular intervals. This is because sitting for a long time in the same position may prevent 
good blood circulation and may increase your risk of blood clots. If you need to remain 
immobile for an extended period of time or are scheduled to have surgery, it is important for 
you to talk to your doctor about ways you can reduce the risk of blood clots. </p>
<p>if you are pre-menopausal. CONBRIZA has only been studied in women who have reached 
menopause, and therefore is not recommended. </p>
<p>if you have had increased levels of triglycerides (a type of fat found in your blood) in the past. </p>
<p>if you have liver or severe kidney problems. </p>
<p>if you have any vaginal bleeding while you take CONBRIZA, you should speak with your 
doctor. </p>
<p>if you are suffering from breast cancer, as there is insufficient experience with this medicine use 
in women with this disease. </p>
<p>The above are some reasons why this medicine may not be suitable for you. If any of them apply to 
you, talk to your doctor before you take the medicine. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CONBRIZA </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>CONBRIZA is for use only by postmenopausal women. It must not be taken by women who are 
pregnant or who could still have a baby. Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding, because it 
is not known whether it is excreted in mother's milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>If you feel drowsy after taking this medicine, you should avoid driving or operating machines.  </p>
<p>You may notice problems with your eyesight such as blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this 
happens, you should avoid driving or operating machines until your doctor tells you that it is safe to do 
so. </p>
<p>CONBRIZA contains lactose and sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. This medicine contains 
less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

you to. In order for this medicine to treat osteoporosis, it must be taken daily. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is one tablet by mouth daily. Taking more than one tablet daily is not 
more effective and may carry additional risks. </p>
<p>You can take the tablet at any time of the day, with or without food. </p>
<p>This medicine should be taken with an adequate amount of calcium and vitamin D. Consult your 
doctor to see if your dietary calcium and vitamin D intake is adequate and whether you need 
calcium and vitamin D supplementation. If you take supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D, it 
may be taken at the same time as this medicine. </p>
<p>If you take more CONBRIZA than you should </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you accidentally take more CONBRIZA than you should. </p>
<p>If you forget to take CONBRIZA </p>
<p>If you forget to take a tablet, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time to take 
your next dose of this medicine, skip the dose you missed and only take your next scheduled dose. Do 
not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
<p>If you stop taking CONBRIZA </p>

should talk to your doctor first. </p>
