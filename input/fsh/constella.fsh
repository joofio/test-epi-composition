Constella contains the active substance linaclotide. It is used to treat the symptoms of moderate to severe 
irritable bowel syndrome (often just called  IBS ) with constipation in adult patients.
IBS is a common gut disorder.  The main symptoms of IBS with constipation include:</p>
<p>stomach or abdominal pain, </p>
<p>feeling bloated, </p>
<p>infrequent, hard, small or pellet-like stools (faeces).
These symptoms may vary from person to person. 
How Constella works
Constella acts locally in your gut, helping you to feel less pain and less bloated, and to restore the normal 
functioning of your bowels. It is not absorbed into the body, but attaches to receptor called guanylate cyclase 
C on the surface of your gut. By attaching to this receptor, it blocks the sensation of pain and allows liquid to 
enter from the body into the gut, thereby loosening the stools and increasing your bowel movements.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor has given this medicine to you after excluding other diseases, especially of your bowels and 
concluding that you suffer from IBS with constipation. Because these other diseases may have the same 
symptoms as IBS, it is important that you report any change or irregularity in symptoms to your doctor 
promptly.
If you experience severe or prolonged diarrhoea (passing of frequent watery stools for 7 days or more), stop 
taking Constella and contact your doctor (see section 4). Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to replace the 
water and electrolytes like potassium lost from the diarrhoea.
If you have severe stomach symptoms which continue or get worse, stop taking Constella and contact your 
doctor immediately because these could be symptoms of a hole developing in the bowel wall 
(gastrointestinal perforation). See section 4. Talk to your doctor if you experience bleeding from the bowel or rectum.
Take special care if you are older than 65 years, as there is a higher risk you experience diarrhoea.
Take also special care if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea and an additional disease, such as high 
blood pressure, previous disease of the heart and blood vessels (e.g. such as previous heart attacks) or 
diabetes.
Talk to your doctor if you suffer from inflammatory diseases of the guts such as Crohn s disease or
ulcerative colitis as Constella is not recommended in these patients.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and 
efficacy of Constella in this age group has not been established.
Other medicines and Constella
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines:
<em>Some medicines may not work as effectively if you have severe or prolonged diarrhoea, such as:
-
Oral contraceptives. If you have very bad diarrhoea, the contraceptive pill may not work properly and 
the use of an extra method of contraception is recommended. See the instructions in the patient leaflet 
of the contraceptive pill you are taking.
-
Medicines that need careful and exact dosing, such as levothyroxine (a hormone to treat reduced 
function of the thyroid gland).
</em>Some medicines may increase the risk of diarrhoea when taken with Constella, such as:
-
Medicines to treat stomach ulcers or excessive production of stomach acid called Proton Pump 
Inhibitors.
-
Medicines to treat pain and inflammation called NSAIDs.
-
Laxatives.
Constella with food 
Constella produces more frequent bowel movements and diarrhoea (looser stools) when it is taken with food 
than when it is taken on an empty stomach (see section 3).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Limited information is available on the effects of Constella in pregnant and breast-feeding women. 
Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
unless your doctor advises you to do so.
In a milk-only lactation study in seven lactating women, who were already taking linaclotide therapeutically, 
neither linaclotide nor its active metabolite were detected in the milk. Therefore breastfeeding is not 
expected to result in exposure of the infant to linaclotide and Constella can be used during breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
Constella will not affect your ability to drive or use machines</p>         </div>"""

capsule should be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal.
If you have not experienced improvement in your symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, you should contact 
your doctor.
If you take more Constella than you should
The most likely effect of taking too much Constella is diarrhoea. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you 
have taken too much of this medicine.
If you forget to take Constella
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just take the next dose at the scheduled time and 
continue as normal.
If you stop taking Constella
It is preferable to discuss stopping treatment with your doctor before actually doing so.  However, treatment 
with Constella can be safely stopped at any time. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
