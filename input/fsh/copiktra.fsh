can kill and reduce the number of cancerous B-lymphocytes. </p>

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking Copiktra. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Copiktra, 
- if you have an infection. This must be treated before you start taking Copiktra. 
- if you have intestinal problems 
- if you have lung or breathing problems </p>
<p>Infections 
Infections are common during Copiktra treatment, and can be serious and can lead to death. Tell your 
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse right away if you have fever, chills, or other signs of an infection during 
treatment with Copiktra. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine while you are taking Copiktra, 
to prevent certain types of infection. </p>
<p>Diarrhoea or inflammation of your intestine<br />
Diarrhoea or inflammation of your intestine (colitis) is common during Copiktra treatment, and can be 
serious and can lead to death. Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you have any new or 
worsening diarrhoea, you pass mucus or blood when going to the toilet, or if you have severe 
abdominal (stomach area) pain. Your doctor or pharmacist should prescribe medicine to help your 
diarrhoea and check you at least weekly. If your diarrhoea is severe or anti-diarrhoea medicines do not 
work, you may need treatment with a steroid medicine. </p>
<p>Skin reactions<br />
Copiktra can cause rashes and other skin reactions that can be serious and can lead to death. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist right away if you get new or worsening skin rash, or other skin reactions during 
treatment with Copiktra, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>painful sores or ulcers on your skin, lips, or in your mouth </li>
<li>severe rash with blisters or peeling skin </li>
<li>rash with itching </li>
<li>rash with fever

other skin reactions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Inflammation of the lungs<br />
Copiktra can cause inflammation of your lungs which can be serious and can lead to death. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist right away if you get new or worsening cough or difficulty breathing. Your 
doctor may do tests to check your lungs if you have breathing problems. Your doctor may treat you 
with a steroid medicine if you develop inflammation of the lungs that is not due to an infection. </p>
<p>Elevated liver enzymes 
Copiktra may cause abnormalities in blood tests for your liver. Your doctor will check for liver 
problems during your treatment with Copiktra. Tell your doctor right away if you get any symptoms of 
liver problems, including yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes (jaundice), abdominal 
pain, bruising or bleeding more easily than normal. </p>
<p>Blood counts 
Low white blood cell counts (neutropenia) and  decrease in red blood cell (anaemia or bloodlessness) 
can occur in patients treated with Copiktra. Both can be serious. Your doctor will check your blood 
counts regularly. Tell your doctor right away if you get fever or any signs of infection, if you feel tired 
or dizzy, or if you have headache. </p>
<p>If you have any of the above serious side effects during treatment with Copiktra, your doctor may 
pause your treatment, change your dose of Copiktra, or completely stop your treatment with Copiktra. </p>
