  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Cosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising 
the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. </p>
<p>Cosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
* Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
* Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis </p>
<p>Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Cosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called  plaque psoriasis , which causes inflammation 
affecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is 
used in adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. </p>
<p>Using Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you (or your child) by leading to improvements of skin 
clearance and reducing symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. </p>
<p>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis 
Cosentyx is used in patients (6 years of age and older) to treat conditions of the juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis categories called  enthesitis-related arthritis  and  juvenile psoriatic arthritis . These 
conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone. </p>
<p>Using Cosentyx in enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis will benefit you (or your 
child) by reducing the symptoms and improving your (or your child s) physical function. </p>
