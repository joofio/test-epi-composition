Cotellic is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance cobimetinib.  </p>
<p>What Cotellic is used for 
Cotellic is used to treat adult patients with a type of skin cancer called melanoma, that has spread to 
other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. 
* It is used in combination with another anti-cancer medicine called vemurafenib.<br />
* It can only be used in patients whose cancer has a change (mutation) in a protein called 
 BRAF . Before starting treatment, your doctor will test for this mutation. This change may 
have led to the development of melanoma.  </p>
<p>How Cotellic works 
Cotellic targets a protein called  MEK  that is important in controlling cancer cell growth. When 
Cotellic is used in combination with vemurafenib (which targets the changed  BRAF  protein), it 
further slows down or stops the growth of your cancer. </p>         </div>"""

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Cotellic. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Cotellic if you have: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bleeding 
Cotellic can cause severe bleeding, especially in your brain or stomach (see also  Severe bleeding  in 
Section 4). Tell your doctor straight away if you have any unusual bleeding or any of these symptoms: 
headaches, dizziness, feeling weak, blood in the stools or black stools and vomiting blood.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eye problems 
Cotellic can cause eye problems (see also  Eye (vision) problems  in Section 4). Tell your doctor 
straight away if you get the following symptoms: blurred vision, distorted vision, partly missing 
vision, or any other changes to your sight during treatment. Your doctor should examine your eyes if 
you have any new or worsening problems with your sight while you are taking Cotellic. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart problems 
Cotellic can lower the amount of blood pumped by your heart (see also  Heart problems  in 
Section 4). Your doctor should do tests before and during your treatment with Cotellic to check how 
well your heart can pump blood. Tell your doctor straight away if it feels like your heart is pounding, 
racing or beating unevenly, or if you experience dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, 
tiredness, or swelling in the legs.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver problems 
Cotellic can increase the amount of some liver enzymes in your blood during treatment. Your doctor 
will do blood tests to check these amounts and monitor how well your liver is working.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle problems 
Cotellic can cause increased levels of creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that is found mainly in the 
muscle, heart, and brain. This can be a sign of muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis) (see also  Muscle 
problems  in Section 4). Your doctor will do blood tests to monitor for this. Tell your doctor straight 
away if you get any of these symptoms: muscle aches, muscle spasms, weakness, or dark- or red-
coloured urine.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diarrhoea 
Tell your doctor straight away if you get diarrhoea. Severe diarrhoea can cause loss of body fluid 
(dehydration). Follow your doctor s instructions for what to do to help prevent or treat diarrhoea. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Cotellic is not recommended for children and adolescents. The safety and efficacy of Cotellic in 
people younger than 18 years old have not been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cotellic 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Cotellic can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other 
medicines can affect the way Cotellic works. </p>
