<li>What Cubicin is and what it is used for
The active substance in Cubicin powder for solution for injection or infusion is daptomycin.
Daptomycin is an antibacterial that can stop the growth of certain bacteria. Cubicin is used in adults
and in children and adolescents (age from 1 to 17 years) to treat infections of the skin and the tissues
below the skin. It is also used to treat infections in the blood when associated with skin infection. 
Cubicin is also used in adults to treat infections in the tissues that line the inside of the heart
(including heart valves) which are caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. It is also
used to treat infections in the blood caused by the same type of bacteria when associated with heart
infection.
Depending on the type of infection(s) that you have, your doctor may also prescribe other
antibacterials while you are receiving treatment with Cubicin.</li>

If you are allergic to daptomycin or to sodium hydroxide or to any of the other ingredients of this
medicine (listed in section 6).
If this applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse. If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor or
nurse for advice.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Cubicin:
- If you have, or have previously had kidney problems. Your doctor may need to change the dose
of Cubicin (see section 3 of this leaflet).
- Occasionally, patients receiving Cubicin may develop tender or aching muscles or muscle
weakness (see section 4 of this leaflet for more information). If this happens tell your doctor.
Your doctor will make sure you have a blood test and will advise whether or not to continue
with Cubicin. The symptoms generally go away within a few days of stopping Cubicin.
- If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores, or
36
serious kidney problems after taking daptomycin.
- If you are very overweight. There is a possibility that your blood levels of Cubicin could be
higher than those found in persons of average weight and you may need careful monitoring in
case of side effects.
If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Cubicin.
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you develop any of the following symptoms:
- Serious, acute allergic reactions have been observed in patients treated with nearly all
antibacterial agents, including Cubicin. The symptoms can include wheezing, difficulty
breathing, swelling of the face, neck and throat, rashes and hives, or fever. 
- Serious skin disorders have been reported with the use of Cubicin. The symptoms that occur
with these skin disorders can include:
- a new or worsening fever,
- red raised or fluid-filled skin spots which may start in your armpits or on your chest or
groin areas and which can spread over a large area of your body,
- blisters or sores in your mouth or on your genitals.
- A serious kidney problem has been reported with the use of Cubicin. The symptoms can include
fever and rash.
- Any unusual tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, loss of feeling or difficulties with
movements. If this happens, tell your doctor who will decide whether you should continue the
treatment.
- Diarrhoea, especially if you notice blood or mucus, or if diarrhoea becomes severe or
persistent.
- New or worsening fever, cough or difficulty breathing. These may be signs of a rare but serious
lung disorder called eosinophilic pneumonia. Your doctor will check the condition of your
lungs and decide whether or not you should continue Cubicin treatment.
Cubicin may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. The results
can suggest poor blood clotting when, in fact, there is no problem. Therefore, it is important that your
doctor takes into account that you are receiving Cubicin. Please inform your doctor that you are on
treatment with Cubicin.
Your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor the health of your muscles both before you start
treatment and frequently during treatment with Cubicin.
Children and adolescents
Cubicin should not be administered to children below one year of age as studies in animals have
indicated that this age group may experience severe side effects.
Use in elderly
People over the age of 65 can be given the same dose as other adults, provided their kidneys are
working well.
Other medicines and Cubicin
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
It is particularly important that you mention the following:
- Medicines called statins or fibrates (to lower cholesterol) or ciclosporin (a medicinal product
used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other conditions, e.g. rheumatoid
arthritis or atopic dermatitis). It is possible that the risk of side effects affecting the muscles
may be higher when any of these medicines (and some others that can affect muscles) is taken
during treatment with Cubicin. Your doctor may decide not to give you Cubicin or to stop the
other medicine for a while.
- Pain killing medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2
inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). These could interfere with the effects of Cubicin in the kidney.
- Oral anti-coagulants (e.g. warfarin), which are medicines that prevent blood from clotting. It
37
may be necessary for your doctor to monitor your blood clotting times.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Cubicin is not usually given to pregnant women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may
be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are
given this medicine.
Do not breast-feed if you are receiving Cubicin, because it may pass into your breast milk and could
affect the baby.
Driving and using machines
Cubicin has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines.
Cubicin contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.</p>         </div>"""

Adults (18 years of age and above)
The dose will depend on how much you weigh and the type of infection being treated. The usual dose
for adults is 4 mg for every kilogram (kg) of body weight once daily for skin infections or 6 mg for
every kg of body weight once daily for a heart infection or a blood infection associated with skin or
heart infection. In adult patients, this dose is given directly into your blood stream (into a vein), either
as an infusion lasting about 30 minutes or as an injection lasting about 2 minutes. The same dose is
recommended in people aged over 65 years provided their kidneys are working well.
If your kidneys do not work well, you may receive Cubicin less often, e.g. once every other day. If
you are receiving dialysis, and your next dose of Cubicin is due on a dialysis day, you will be usually
given Cubicin after the dialysis session.
Children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age)
The dose for children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) will depend on the age of patient and the
type of infection being treated. This dose is given directly into the blood stream (into a vein), as an
infusion lasting about 30-60 minutes.
A course of treatment usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks for skin infections. For blood or heart infections
and skin infections your doctor will decide how long you should be treated.
Detailed instructions for use and handling are given at the end of the leaflet.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only
Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics before prescribing.
Instructions for use and handling
350 mg presentation:
In adults, daptomycin may be administered intravenously as an infusion over 30 minutes or as an
injection over 2 minutes. Unlike in adults, daptomycin should not be administered by injection over a
2-minute period in paediatric patients. Paediatric patients 7 to 17 years old should receive daptomycin
infused over 30 minutes. In paediatric patients under 7 years old receiving a 9-12 mg/kg dose,
daptomycin should be administered over 60 minutes. Preparation of the solution for infusion requires
an additional dilution step as detailed below.
Cubicin given as an intravenous infusion over 30 or 60 minutes
A 50 mg/ml concentration of Cubicin for infusion can be achieved by reconstituting the lyophilised
product with 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.
The lyophilised product takes approximately 15 minutes to dissolve. The fully reconstituted product
will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.
To prepare Cubicin for intravenous infusion, please adhere to the following instructions:
Aseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute or dilute lyophilised Cubicin.
For Reconstitution:</p>         </div>"""
