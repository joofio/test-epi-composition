<p>Cufence contains the active substance trientine, a copper-chelating agent that is used to remove excess 
of copper from the body. Cufence attaches to the copper, which is then passed from the body.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to trientine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling of the face, fainting and breathing 
problems. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Your doctor will need to regularly check for symptoms of the disease and copper levels in your blood 
and urine. Regular monitoring is especially important at the start of your treatment or when your dose 
is changed, in growing children and pregnant women to ensure that copper levels are maintained at a 
suitable level. The doctor may need to increase or decrease your dose of Cufence.  </p>
<p>Nervous system problems can occur (for example, shaking, lack of coordination, slurred speech, 
muscle stiffness and worsening of muscle spasms), especially in patients just starting treatment with 
Cufence. If you notice these whilst taking Cufence, you must tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Lupus-like reactions (symptoms may include persistent rash, fever, joint pain, and tiredness) have 
been reported in some patients switched to trientine medicine after penicillamine medicine. However, 
it was not possible to determine if the reaction was due to trientine or to previous penicillamine 
treatment. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cufence </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If you are taking iron tablets or medicines that neutralise the acid in your stomach, leave at least 
2 hours before or after you have taken Cufence because they may reduce Cufence s effect. 
It is recommended that trientine is taken at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product. </p>
<p>Cufence with food and drink </p>
<p>Take this medicine with water only. Do not take it with other drinks, milk or food because they may 
reduce the medicine s effect. Avoid eating or drinking (except water) for 2 hours before and 1 hour 
after taking Cufence. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is very important to continue 
treatment to maintain normal copper levels during pregnancy. You and your doctor should fully 
discuss the potential benefits of treatment whilst considering any possible risks that there may be. 
Your doctor will advise you which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. If you become 
pregnant whilst taking Cufence, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant and taking Cufence, you will be monitored throughout your pregnancy for any 
effects on the baby or changes in your copper levels.  </p>
<p>The limited information available suggests that Cufence does not pass into breast milk, but it is not 
certain that there is no risk to the baby.  It is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or 
plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop taking 
Cufence, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Cufence to the 
mother. Your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Trientine is not likely to have an effect on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""
