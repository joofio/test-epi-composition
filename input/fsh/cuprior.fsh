  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Cuprior is a medicine used to treat Wilson’s disease that contains the active substance trientine.  </p>
<p>Wilson’s disease is an inherited condition in which the body cannot transport copper around the body 
in the normal way or remove copper in the normal way as a secretion from the liver into the gut. This 
means that the small amounts of copper from food and drink build up to excessive levels and can lead 
to liver damage and problems in the nervous system. This medicine mainly works by attaching to 
copper in the body which then allows it to be removed in the urine instead, helping to lower copper 
levels. It may also attach to copper in the gut and so reduce the amount taken up into the body.<br />
Cuprior is given to adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years and over who cannot tolerate another 
medicine that is used to treat this disease, called penicillamine. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to trientine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cuprior. </p>
<p>If you were already taking another trientine medicine, your doctor may modify your daily dose, the 
number of tablets or the number of intake in the day when switching to Cuprior treatment.  </p>
<p>Your symptoms may initially get worse after starting the treatment. If this happens, you must tell your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor will regularly check your blood and urine to ensure that you receive the right dose of 
Cuprior to properly control your symptoms and copper levels.  </p>
<p>You should tell your doctor if you get any side effects as this may indicate that your dose of Cuprior 
needs to be adjusted up or down.  </p>
<p>This medicine may also reduce the level of iron in your blood and your doctor may prescribe iron 
supplements (see section “Other medicines and Cuprior” below). </p>
<p>If you have kidney problems, your doctor will regularly check that the treatment dose is appropriate 
and does not affect the functioning of your kidney. </p>
<p>The association of trientine with another medicine that contains zinc is not recommended.  </p>
<p>Lupus-like reactions (symptoms may include persistent rash, fever, joint pain, and tiredness) have 
been reported in some patients switched to trientine medicine after penicillamine medicine. However it 
was not possible to determine if the reaction was due to trientine or to previous penicillamine 
treatment.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Your doctor will carry out checks more frequently to ensure your copper levels are maintained at a 
suitable level for normal growth and mental development.<br />
This medicine is not recommended for children aged below 5 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cuprior 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>In particular, you must tell your doctor if you are already taking iron supplements or if you take 
indigestion remedies (medicines that reduce discomfort after eating). If you take these medicines you 
may need to take Cuprior at a different time in the day because otherwise Cuprior may not be as 
effective. If you take iron supplements, make sure that at least two hours have passed between taking 
Cuprior and taking your iron supplements. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>It is very important to continue treatment to reduce copper during pregnancy. You and your doctor 
should fully discuss the potential benefits of treatment whilst considering any possible risks that there 
may be. Your doctor will advise you which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant and taking Cuprior, you will be monitored throughout your pregnancy for any 
effects on the baby or changes in your copper levels. When your baby is born, the copper level in the 
baby’s blood will also be monitored.  </p>
<p>It is not known if Cuprior can pass into breast milk. It is important to tell your doctor if you are 
breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding 
or to stop taking Cuprior, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of 
Cuprior to the mother. Your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your 
situation. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Cuprior is not expected to affect your ability to drive a car or use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Cuprior contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free.’ </p>         </div>"""

were told to, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you take more than you should, you may get nausea, vomiting and dizziness. </p>
