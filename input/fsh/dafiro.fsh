  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Dafiro HCT tablets contain three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. All 
of these substances help to control high blood pressure. 
− 
Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine 
stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall, which stops the blood vessels from 
tightening. 
− 
Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. 
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the 
blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. 
− 
Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of substances called “thiazide diuretics”. 
Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. 
As a result of all three mechanisms, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. </p>
<p>Dafiro HCT is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients whose blood pressure is already 
controlled while taking amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide and who may benefit from 
taking one tablet containing all three substances. </p>         </div>"""

− 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also recommended to avoid Dafiro HCT in early 
pregnancy – see Pregnancy section.)

hydrochlorothiazide, sulphonamide-derived medicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary 
infections), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, do not take Dafiro HCT and talk to your doctor.

leading to the build up of bile in the liver (cholestasis). 
− 
if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. 
− 
if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). 
− 
if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment to increase the 
potassium or sodium levels in your blood. 
− 
if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment to reduce the calcium levels in 
your blood. 
− 
if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). 
− 
if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). 
− 
if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition

− 
if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. 
− 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Dafiro HCT 
− 
if you have a low level of potassium or magnesium in your blood (with or without symptoms 
such as muscle weakness, muscle spasms, abnormal heart rhythm). 
− 
if you have a low level of sodium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as tiredness, 
confusion, muscle twitching, convulsions). 
− 
if you have a high level of calcium in your blood (with or without symptoms such as nausea, 
vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, frequent urination, thirst, muscle weakness and 
twitching). 
− 
if you have kidney problems, have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have 
a narrowing of your kidney arteries. 
− 
if you have liver problems. 
− 
if you have or have had heart failure or coronary artery disease, particularly if you are 
prescribed the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg). 
− 
if you have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor’s instructions for the starting dose 
carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. 
− 
if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic 
or mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). 
− 
if you suffer from aldosteronism. This is a disease in which the adrenal glands make too much 
of the hormone aldosterone If this applies to you, the use of Dafiro HCT is not recommended. 
− 
if you suffer from a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or 
“SLE”). 
− 
if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). 
− 
if you have high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. 
− 
if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. 
− 
if you had an allergic reaction to other high blood pressure medicines or diuretics (a type of 
medicine also known as “water tablets”), especially if you suffer from asthma and allergies 
− 
if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). 
− 
if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other 
medicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, 
stop taking Dafiro HCT and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Dafiro 
HCT again. 
− 
if you experience dizziness and/or fainting during treatment with Dafiro HCT, tell your doctor 
as soon as possible. 
− 
if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid 
accumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in 
your eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Dafiro HCT. This can lead to 
permanent vision impairment, if not treated. 
− 
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
− 
an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. 
− 
aliskiren. 
− 
if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase 
the risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin 
from sun exposure and UV rays while taking Dafiro HCT. 
− 
if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath 
or difficulty breathing after taking Dafiro HCT, seek medical attention immediately. </p>
<p>Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading “Do not take Dafiro HCT”. </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents

<p>Elderly people (age 65 years and older) 
Dafiro HCT can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults and in 
the same way as they have already taken the three substances called amlodipine, valsartan and 
hydrochlorothiazide. Elderly patients, particularly those taking the maximum dose of Dafiro HCT 
(10 mg/320 mg/25 mg), should have their blood pressure checked regularly. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dafiro HCT 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other

* vitamin D and calcium salts. </p>
<p>Dafiro HCT with food, drink and alcohol 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are prescribed Dafiro HCT. 
This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active 
substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect 
of Dafiro HCT. Talk to your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol may make your blood pressure 
fall too much and/or increase the possibility of dizziness or fainting. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will 
normally advise you to stop taking Dafiro HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know 
you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Dafiro HCT. Dafiro HCT is 
not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Amlodipine has been 
shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts. Dafiro HCT is not recommended for mothers who 
are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, 
especially if your baby is a newborn, or was born prematurely. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine may make you feel dizzy, drowsy, nauseous or have a headache. If you experience 
these symptoms, do not drive or use tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""
