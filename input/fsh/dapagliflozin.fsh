<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris contains the active substance dapagliflozin. It belongs to a group of medicines 
called  sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors . They work by blocking the SGLT2 
protein in your kidney. By blocking this protein, blood sugar (glucose), salt (sodium) and water are 
removed from your body via the urine. </p>
<p>What Dapagliflozin Viatris is used for </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris is used to treat: </p>
<ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes </li>
<li>in adults and children aged 10 years and older. </li>
<li>if your type 2 diabetes cannot be controlled with diet and exercise. </li>
<li>Dapagliflozin Viatris can be used on its own or together with other medicines to treat 
diabetes. </li>
<li>
<p>It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart failure </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in adults (aged 18 years and older) with symptoms due to a weak pump function of the 
heart. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chronic kidney disease </p>
</li>
<li>in adults with reduced kidney function. </li>
</ul>
<p>What is type 2 diabetes and how does Dapagliflozin Viatris help? </p>
<ul>
<li>In type 2 diabetes your body does not make enough insulin or is not able to use the insulin it 
makes properly. This leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. This can lead to serious 
problems like heart or kidney disease, blindness, and poor circulation in your arms and legs. </li>
<li>Dapagliflozin Viatris works by removing excess sugar from your body. It can also help prevent 
heart disease. </li>
</ul>
<p>What is heart failure and how does Dapagliflozin Viatris help? </p>
<ul>
<li>This type of heart failure occurs when the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the 
lungs and the rest of the body. This can lead to serious medical problems and need for hospital 
care. </li>
<li>The most common symptoms of heart failure are feeling breathless, feeling tired or very tired all 
the time, and ankle swelling. </li>
<li>Dapagliflozin Viatris helps protect your heart from getting weaker and improves your 
symptoms. It can lower the need to go to hospital and can help some patients to live longer. </li>
</ul>
<p>What is chronic kidney disease and how does Dapagliflozin Viatris help? </p>
<ul>
<li>When you have chronic kidney disease, your kidneys may gradually lose their function. This 
means they would not be able to clean and filter your blood the way they should. Loss of kidney 
function can lead to serious medical problems and need for hospital care. </li>
<li>Dapagliflozin Viatris helps protect your kidneys from losing their function. That can help some 
patients to live longer. </li>

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to dapagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away: </p>
<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have diabetes and experience feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat or rapid 
weight loss. </li>
<li>The above symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic ketoacidosis    a rare but serious, sometimes 
life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of  ketone 
bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests. </li>
<li>The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive 
alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin 
due to major surgery or serious illness. </li>
<li>When you are treated with Dapagliflozin Viatris, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur even if your 
blood sugar is normal. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you suspect you have diabetic ketoacidosis, contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away 
and do not take this medicine. </p>
<p>Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum </p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or 
feeling generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even 
lifethreatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene 
which destroys the tissue under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Dapagliflozin Viatris: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have  type 1 diabetes    the type that usually starts when you are young, and your body 
does not produce any insulin. </li>
<li>If you have diabetes and have a kidney problem   your doctor may ask you to take additional 
or a different medicine to control your blood sugar. </li>
<li>If you have a liver problem   your doctor may start you on a lower dose. </li>
<li>If you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history 
of low blood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below under  Other medicines 
and Dapagliflozin Viatris . </li>
<li>If you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too 
much body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed in section 4. Tell your doctor before 
you start taking this medicine if you have any of these signs. </li>
<li>If you have or develop nausea (feeling sick), vomiting or fever or if you are not able to eat or 
drink. These conditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking 
Dapagliflozin Viatris until you recover to prevent dehydration. </li>
<li>If you often get infections of the urinary tract. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking Dapagliflozin Viatris. </p>
<p>Diabetes and foot care </p>
<p>If you have diabetes, it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional. </p>
<p>Urine glucose </p>
<p>Because of how Dapagliflozin Viatris works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris can be used in children aged 10 years and older for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes. No data are available in children below 10 years of age. </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age for the 
treatment of heart failure or for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, because it has not been 
studied in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dapagliflozin Viatris </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Especially tell your doctor: 
* if you are taking a medicine used to remove water from the body (diuretic). 
* if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or 
a  sulphonylurea  medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, 
to prevent you from getting low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). 
* if you are taking lithium because Dapagliflozin Viatris can lower the amount of lithium in your 
blood. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should stop taking this medicine 
if you become pregnant, since it is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. Do not use 
Dapagliflozin Viatris if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if this medicine passes into human 
breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Taking this medicine with other medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause too low 
blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and 
change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Do not drive or use any tools or machines, if you feel dizzy taking Dapagliflozin Viatris. </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris contains lactose </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have 
an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin Viatris contains sodium. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
