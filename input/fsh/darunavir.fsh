Darunavir Mylan contains the active substance darunavir. Darunavir is an antiretroviral medicine used 
in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called protease inhibitors. Darunavir works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. 
This will improve your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV 
infection. </p>
<p>What it is used for? 
Darunavir is used to treat adults and children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15 kilogram 
body weight who are infected by HIV and who have already used other antiretroviral medicines. </p>
<p>Darunavir must be taken in combination with a low dose of ritonavir and other anti-HIV medicines. 
Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Darunavir Mylan. </p>
<p>Darunavir is not a cure for HIV infection.  </p>
<p>People taking darunavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. 
You must keep in regular contact with your doctor. </p>
<p>People taking darunavir may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or 
potentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash. </p>
<p>In patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) 
may occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment 
Make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. 
- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C 
infection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can 
take darunavir. 
- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood. 
- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged 
lymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of 
opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may 
occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an 
improvement in the body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may 
have been present with no obvious symptoms. 
- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment. 
- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. Darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding. 
- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections). 
- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking 
combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral 
therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass 
index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of 
osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and 
difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Elderly 
Darunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this 
age group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Darunavir Mylan. </p>
<p>Children 
Darunavir is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Darunavir Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. </p>
<p>There are some medicines that you must not combine with darunavir. These are mentioned above 
under the heading  Do not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines:  </p>
<p>In most cases, darunavir can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. 
NRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. Darunavir with ritonavir has not been tested 
with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage of 
other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other anti- HIV medicines and follow your doctor s instruction carefully on which medicines can be combined. </p>
<p>The effects of darunavir might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your doctor 
if you take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures) </li>
<li>Dexamethasone (corticosteroid) </li>
<li>Efavirenz (HIV infection) </li>
<li>Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis) </li>
<li>Saquinavir (HIV infection). </li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take darunavir and your doctor might want 
to do some additional blood tests. Tell your doctor if you take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol, 
mexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the 
therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased. </li>
<li>Apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin, clopidogrel (to reduce 
clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic effect or side effects may be altered. </li>
<li>Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. Darunavir might 
reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of non-hormonal 
contraception are recommended. </li>
<li>Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. Darunavir might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels 
by drospirenone. </li>
<li>Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage 
might be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for 
your specific situation. </li>
<li>Clarithromycin (antibiotic) </li>
<li>Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as the 
therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased.  </li>
<li>Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, 
triamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel 
diseases, inflammatory conditions of the skin, eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory 
conditions. These medicines are generally taken orally, inhaled, injected or applied to the skin. 
If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation and under 
close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects. </li>
<li>Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence) </li>
<li>Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma) </li>
<li>Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria) </li>
<li>Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer) </li>
<li>Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder 
called pulmonary arterial hypertension) </li>
<li>Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (to treat hepatitis C infection) </li>
<li>Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain) </li>
<li>
<p>Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your doctor might want to do some additional blood tests and the dosage of other medicines 
might need to be changed since either their own or darunavir s therapeutic effect or side effects 
may be influenced when combined. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) </li>

<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects 
Liver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests 
before you start darunavir. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check

skin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements), 
nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below 
your ribs. </p>
<p>Skin rash (more often when used in combination with raltegravir), itching. The rash is usually mild to 
moderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a rare severe situation. It is therefore important to 
talk to your doctor if you develop a rash. Your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms 
or whether darunavir must be stopped. 
Other severe side effects were diabetes (common), and inflammation of the pancreas (uncommon).
