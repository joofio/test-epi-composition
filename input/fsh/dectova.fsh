<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Serious skin or allergic reactions </p>
<p>Serious skin or allergic reactions may occur after Dectova is given. Symptoms may include skin or throat 
swelling, difficulty breathing, blistering rash or peeling skin (see also  Serious skin or allergic reactions  in 
section 4). </p>
<p>Sudden changes in behaviour, hallucinations and fits </p>
<p>During treatment with Dectova, changes in behaviour such as confusion and unresponsiveness may occur. 
Some people may also have hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there) or fits 
(seizures) which can lead to loss of consciousness. These symptoms also occur in people with flu who are 
not being given Dectova. So it is not known if Dectova played a part in causing them. </p>
<p>If you are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) </p>
<p>Your doctor may monitor you more closely if your immune system is not working properly to ensure the 
treatment is working. Your doctor may switch you to an alternative treatment where appropriate. </p>
<p>If you notice any of the above symptoms: 
  Tell a doctor or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dectova<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Dectova should not affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Dectova contains sodium 
This medicine contains 70.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 3.54% of the recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>How much Dectova is given<br />
Your doctor will decide how much Dectova is right for you. The amount you are given is based on your age, 
body weight, and the results of your blood tests (to check how well your kidneys are working). </p>
<p>Your dose may be increased or decreased depending on how well you respond to treatment. </p>
<p>Adults 
The recommended dose is 600 mg twice daily for 5 to 10 days. </p>
<p>If your kidneys are not working as well as they should, your doctor will decide on the reduced dose for you. </p>
<p>Children<br />
Your doctor will decide on the correct dose of Dectova. </p>
<p>When and how Dectova is given 
Dectova should be given as soon as possible, usually within 6 days of the symptoms of flu appearing. </p>
<p>A doctor or nurse will give you Dectova as an infusion (drip) into a vein. It is usually given into your arm 
over about 30 minutes. </p>
<p>If you have any questions on the use of Dectova, ask the doctor or nurse who is giving it you. </p>
<p>If you are given more Dectova than you should<br />
It is unlikely that you will be given too much, but if you think you have been given too much Dectova, tell 
your doctor or nurse immediately.  </p>         </div>"""
