  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Deferasirox Mylan is 
Deferasirox Mylan contains an active substance called deferasirox. It is an iron chelator which is a 
medicine used to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). It traps and 
removes excess iron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. </p>
<p>What Deferasirox Mylan is used for 
Repeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example 
thalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)). However, repeated blood 
transfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. This is because blood contains iron and your body 
does not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. In patients 
with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over time, 
mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. Over time, the 
excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. Medicines called iron chelators 
are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Mylan is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in 
patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Mylan is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is 
contraindicated or inadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by 
infrequent blood transfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 
2 to 5 years. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Mylan is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat 
patients aged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, 
but who are not transfusion dependent. </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If this applies to you, tell your doctor before taking Deferasirox Mylan. If you 
think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>if you have moderate or severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>if you are currently taking any other iron chelator medicines. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Mylan is not recommended </p>
<p>if you are at an advanced stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; decreased production of 
blood cells by the bone marrow) or have advanced cancer. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Deferasirox Mylan: </p>
<p>if you have a kidney or liver problem. </p>
<p>if you have a cardiac problem due to iron overload. </p>
<p>if you notice a marked decrease in your urine output (sign of kidney problem). </p>
<p>if you develop a severe rash, or difficulty breathing and dizziness or swelling mainly of the face 
and throat (signs of severe allergic reaction, see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>if you experience a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of 
the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes 
(signs of severe skin reaction, see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>if you experience a combination of drowsiness, upper right abdominal pain, yellowing or 
increased yellowing of your skin or eyes and dark urine (signs of liver problems). </p>
<p>if you experience difficulty thinking, remembering information, or solving problems, being less 
alert or aware or feeling very sleepy with low energy (signs of a high level of ammonia in your 
blood, which may be associated with liver or renal problems, see also section 4  Possible side 
effects ). </p>
<p>if you vomit blood and/or have black stools. </p>
<p>if you experience frequent abdominal pain, particularly after eating or taking Deferasirox 
Mylan. </p>
<p>if you experience frequent heartburn. </p>
<p>if you have a low level of platelets or white blood cells in your blood test. </p>
<p>if you have blurred vision </p>
<p>if you have diarrhoea or vomiting. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Monitoring your Deferasirox Mylan treatment 
You will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment. These will monitor the amount of iron in 
your body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well Deferasirox Mylan is working. The tests will also 
monitor your kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver 
function (blood level of transaminases). Your doctor may require you to undergo a kidney biopsy, if 
he/she suspects significant kidney damage. You may also have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) 
tests to determine the amount of iron in your liver. Your doctor will take these tests into consideration 
when deciding on the dose of Deferasirox Mylan most suitable for you and will also use these tests to 
decide when you should stop taking Deferasirox Mylan. </p>
<p>Your eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Deferasirox Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes in particular: </p>
<p>other iron chelators, which must not be taken with Deferasirox Mylan, </p>
<p>antacids (medicines used to treat heartburn) containing aluminium, which should not be taken at 
the same time of day as Deferasirox Mylan, </p>
<p>ciclosporin (used to prevent the body rejecting a transplanted organ or for other conditions, such 
as rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), </p>
<p>simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol), </p>
<p>certain painkillers or anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids), </p>
<p>oral bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis), </p>

<p>Additional tests may be required to monitor the blood levels of some of these medicines. </p>
<p>Older people (age 65 years and over) 
Deferasirox Mylan can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. 
Elderly patients may experience more side effects (in particular diarrhoea) than younger patients. They 
should be monitored closely by their doctor for side effects that may require a dose adjustment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Deferasirox Mylan can be used in children and adolescents receiving regular blood transfusions aged 
2 years and over and in children and adolescents not receiving regular blood transfusions aged 
10 years and over. As the patient grows the doctor will adjust the dose. 
Deferasirox Mylan is not recommended for children aged under 2 years. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Mylan is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. </p>
<p>If you are currently using a hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, you should use an 
additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom), as Deferasirox Mylan may reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Deferasirox Mylan. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you feel dizzy after taking Deferasirox Mylan, do not drive or operate any tools or machines until 
you are feeling normal again. </p>

<p>If you forget to take Deferasirox Mylan 
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember on that day. Take your next dose as scheduled. Do 
not take a double dose on the next day to make up for the forgotten tablet(s). </p>
<p>If you stop taking Deferasirox Mylan 
Do not stop taking Deferasirox Mylan unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop taking it, the excess
