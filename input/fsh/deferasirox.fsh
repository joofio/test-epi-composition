  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Deferasirox Accord is 
Deferasirox Accord contains an active substance called deferasirox. It is an iron chelator which is a 
medicine used to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). It traps and 
removes excess iron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. </p>
<p>What Deferasirox Accord is used for 
Repeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example 
thalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)). However, repeated blood 
transfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. This is because blood contains iron and your body 
does not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. In patients 
with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over time, 
mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. Over time, the 
excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. Medicines called iron chelators 
are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Accord is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in 
patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Accord is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is 
contraindicated or inadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by 
infrequent blood transfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to 
5 years. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Accord is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat 
patients aged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, 
but who are not transfusion dependent. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If this applies to you, tell your doctor before taking Deferasirox Accord. If you 
think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
* if you have moderate or severe kidney disease. 
* if you are currently taking any other iron chelator medicines. </p>
<p>Deferasirox Accord is not recommended 
* if you are at an advanced stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; decreased production of 
blood cells by the bone marrow) or have advanced cancer. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Deferasirox Accord: 
* if you have a kidney or liver problem. 
* if you have a cardiac problem due to iron overload. 
* if you notice a marked decrease in your urine output (sign of kidney problem). 
* if you develop a severe rash, or difficulty breathing and dizziness or swelling mainly of the face 
and throat (signs of severe allergic reaction, see also section 4  Possible side effects ). 
* if you experience a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of 
the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes 
(signs of severe skin reaction, see also section 4  Possible side effects ). 
* if you experience a combination of drowsiness, upper right abdominal pain, yellowing or 
increased yellowing of your skin or eyes and dark urine (signs of liver problems). 
* if you experience difficulty thinking, remembering information, or solving problems, being less 
alert or aware or feeling very sleepy with low energy (signs of a high level of ammonia in your 
blood, which may be associated with liver or renal problems, see also section 4  Possible side 
effects ). 
* if you vomit blood and/or have black stools. 
* if you experience frequent abdominal pain, particularly after eating or taking Deferasirox 
Accord. 
* if you experience frequent heartburn. 
* if you have a low level of platelets or white blood cells in your blood test. 
* if you have blurred vision 
* if you have diarrhoea or vomiting. 
* If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Monitoring your Deferasirox Accord treatment 
You will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment. These will monitor the amount of iron in 
your body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well Deferasirox Accord is working. The tests will also 
monitor your kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver 
function (blood level of transaminases). Your doctor may require you to undergo a kidney biopsy, if 
he/she suspects significant kidney damage. You may also have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) 
tests to determine the amount of iron in your liver. Your doctor will take these tests into consideration 
when deciding on the dose of Deferasirox Accord most suitable for you and will also use these tests to 
decide when you should stop taking Deferasirox Accord. </p>
<p>Your eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Deferasirox Accord

medicines.<br />
