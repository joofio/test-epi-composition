- if you are allergic to deferiprone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
- if you have a history of repeated episodes of neutropenia (low white blood cell (neutrophil) 
count); 
- if you have a history of agranulocytosis (very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count); 
- if you are currently taking medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see  Other 
medicines and Deferiprone Lipomed ); 
- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
The most serious side effect that may occur while taking Deferiprone Lipomed is a very low white 
blood cell (neutrophil) count. This condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has 
occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people who have taken deferiprone in clinical trials. Because white blood 
cells help to fight infection, a low neutrophil count may place you at risk of developing a serious and 
potentially life-threatening infection. To monitor for neutropenia, your doctor will ask you to have a 
blood test (to check your white blood cell count) performed regularly, as frequently as every week, 
while you are being treated with Deferiprone Lipomed. It is very important for you to keep all of these 
appointments. Please refer to the patient card provided in the folding box. If you get any symptoms of 
infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms, immediately seek medical attention. Your 
white blood cell count must be checked within 24 hours in order to detect potential agranulocytosis. </p>
<p>If you are HIV positive or if your liver or kidney function is severely impaired, your doctor may 
recommend additional tests. </p>
<p>Your doctor will also ask you to come in for tests to monitor body iron load. In addition, he or she 
might ask you to undergo liver biopsies. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Deferiprone Lipomed. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Deferiprone Lipomed 
Do not take medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see  Do not take Deferiprone 
Lipomed ). Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any 
other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Do not take aluminium-based antacids at the same time as taking Deferiprone Lipomed. </p>
<p>Please consult with your doctor or pharmacist before taking vitamin C with Deferiprone Lipomed. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Deferiprone Lipomed may cause harm to unborn babies when used by pregnant women. Deferiprone 
Lipomed must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or you 
become pregnant during treatment with Deferiprone Lipomed, get medical advice immediately. </p>
<p>Both female and male patients are recommended to take special precautions in their sexual activity if 
there is any possibility for pregnancy to occur. Women of childbearing potential are recommended to 
use effective contraception during treatment with Deferiprone Lipomed and for 6 months after the last 
dose. Men are recommended to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the 
last dose. This should be discussed with your doctor.<br />
Do not use Deferiprone Lipomed if you are breast-feeding. Please refer to the patient card provided in 
the folding box. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machinery. </p>
<p>Deferiprone Lipomed contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet and that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

if you are not sure. The amount of Deferiprone Lipomed that you take will depend on your weight. 
The usual dose is 25 mg/kg, 3 times per day, for a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg. The total daily dose 
should not exceed 100 mg/kg. Take your first dose in the morning. Take your second dose midday. 
Take your third dose in the evening. Deferiprone Lipomed can be taken with or without food; 
however, you may find it easier to remember to take Deferiprone Lipomed if you take it with your 
meals. </p>
<p>If you take more Deferiprone Lipomed than you should 
There are no reports of acute overdose with deferiprone. If you have accidentally taken more than the 
prescribed dose, you should contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Deferiprone Lipomed 
Deferiprone Lipomed will be most effective if you do not miss any doses. If you do miss one dose take 
it as soon as you remember and take your next dose at its regularly scheduled time. If you miss more 
than one dose do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses, just continue with 
your normal schedule. Do not change your daily dose without first talking to your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The most serious side effect of Deferiprone Lipomed is a very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count. 
This condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has occurred in 1 to 2 out of people who have taken deferiprone in clinical trials. A low white blood cell count can be associated 
with a serious and potentially life-threatening infection. Report immediately to your doctor any 
symptoms of infection such as: fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms. </p>

<ul>
<li>abdominal pain </li>
<li>nausea </li>
<li>vomiting </li>
<li>reddish/brown discolouration of urine </li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience nausea or vomiting, it may help to take your Deferiprone Lipomed with some food. 
Discoloured urine is a very common effect and is not harmful. </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):</p>
<ul>
<li>low white blood cell count (agranulocytosis and neutropenia) </li>
<li>headache </li>

<ul>
<li>allergic reactions including skin rash or hives </li>
</ul>
<p>Events of joint pain and swelling ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe disability. In 
most cases, the pain disappeared while patients continued taking deferiprone. </p>
<p>Additional side effects in children 
In post-marketing experience with deferiprone, neurological disorders (such as tremors, walking 
disorders, double vision, involuntary muscle contractions, problems with movement coordination) 
have been reported in children who had been voluntarily prescribed more than double the maximum 
recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for several years and have also been observed in children with 
standard doses of deferiprone. They recovered from these symptoms after discontinuation of 
deferiprone. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of
