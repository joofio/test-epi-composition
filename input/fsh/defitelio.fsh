<p>It is used to treat a condition called hepatic veno-occlusive disease, in which the blood vessels in the 
liver become damaged and obstructed by blood clots. This can be caused by medicines that are given 
prior to a stem cell transplantation. </p>
<p>Defibrotide works by protecting the cells of the blood vessels and preventing or breaking down the 
blood clots.  </p>

<p>Other medicines and Defitelio 
Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting such as acetylsalicylic acid, 
heparins, warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban or if you are taking anti-inflammatory 
medicines (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Defitelio if you are pregnant unless your disease requires treatment with Defitelio. 
If you are sexually active and you or your partner could become pregnant, you both must use effective 
contraception during treatment with Defitelio and for 1 week after stopping the treatment.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that Defitelio will affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
