<p>Degarelix is a synthetic hormone blocker used in the treatment of prostate cancer and for the treatment 
of high-risk prostate cancer prior to radiotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy in adult male 
patients. Degarelix mimics a natural hormone (gonadotrophin-relasing hormone, GnRH) and directly 
blocks its effects. By doing so, degarelix immediately reduces the level of the male hormone 
testosterone that stimulates the prostate cancer. </p>         </div>"""
