  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Delstrigo is
Delstrigo is used to treat HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) infection. It belongs to a group of
medicines called  antiretroviral medicines .
Delstrigo contains the active substances:
* Doravirine - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)
* Lamivudine - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
* Tenofovir disoproxil - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
What Delstrigo is used for
Delstrigo is used to treat HIV infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at
least 35 kg. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ). You should
not take Delstrigo if your doctor has told you that the virus causing your infection is resistant to any of
the medicines in Delstrigo.
How Delstrigo works
Delstrigo works by preventing HIV from making more viruses in your body. This will help by:
* reducing the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your  viral load )
* increasing the number of white blood cells called  CD4+ T . This can make your immune system
stronger. This may reduce your risk of early death or catching infections because your immune
system is weak.</p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to doravirine, lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other
ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. * if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines for seizure)</li>
<li>rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines for tuberculosis)</li>
<li>St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) or
products that contain it</li>
<li>mitotane (a medicine to treat cancer)</li>
<li>enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer)</li>
<li>lumacaftor (a medicine to treat cystic fibrosis)
Do not take Delstrigo if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist,
or nurse before taking Delstrigo. See also the list in section  Other Medicines and Delstrigo .
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Delstrigo.
Worsening of hepatitis B infection
If you have both HIV and hepatitis B virus infections, your hepatitis B may get worse if you stop
taking Delstrigo. You may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. Discuss
your hepatitis B therapy with your doctor.
New or worsening kidney problems, including kidney failure
This can happen in some people who take Delstrigo. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your
kidney function before and during treatment with Delstrigo.
Bone problems
This can happen in some people who take Delstrigo. Bone problems include bone pain, and bone
softening or thinning (which may lead to fractures). Joint or muscle pain or muscle weakness may also
occur. Your doctor may need to do additional tests to check your bones.
Immune reactivation syndrome
This can happen when you start taking any HIV medicine, including Delstrigo. Your immune system
may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell
your doctor right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV medicine.
Autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue)
may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune
disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection
or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up
towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor
immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg. The use
of Delstrigo in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg has not yet been studied.
Other medicines and Delstrigo
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other
medicines. This is because other medicines may affect how Delstrigo works, and Delstrigo might
affect the way some other medicines work.
There are some medicines you must not take with Delstrigo. See list under  Do not take Delstrigo 
section.
Talk to your doctor before taking the following medicines with Delstrigo as your doctor may need to
change the dose of your medicines:</li>
<li>bosentan (a medicine to treat lung disease)</li>
<li>dabrafenib (a medicine to treat skin cancer)</li>
<li>lesinurad (a medicine to treat gout)</li>
<li>modafinil (a medicine to treat excessive sleepiness)</li>
<li>nafcillin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections)</li>
<li>rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)</li>
<li>telotristat ethyl (a medicine to treat diarrhea in people with carcinoid syndrome)</li>
<li>thioridazine (a medicine to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia)
If your doctor decides you should take these medicines with Delstrigo, your doctor will prescribe a
100 mg tablet of doravirine to be taken daily, approximately 12 hours after your dose of Delstrigo.
Your doctor may check your blood levels or monitor for side effects if you take the following
medicines with Delstrigo:</li>
<li>ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis C infection)</li>
<li>sirolimus (a medicine used to control your body s immune response after a transplant)</li>
<li>sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis C infection)</li>
<li>tacrolimus (a medicine used to control your body s immune response after a transplant)</li>
<li>medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol,
mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, talk to
your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Delstrigo. It is preferable to avoid the use of
Delstrigo during pregnancy. This is because it has not been studied in pregnancy and it is not known if
Delstrigo will harm your baby while you are pregnant.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Use with caution when driving, riding a bicycle, or operating machines if you feel tired, dizzy, or
sleepy after taking this medicine
Delstrigo tablets contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to lactose, talk to your doctor before
taking this medicine.</li>

tablet for the treatment of HIV infection.
How much to take
The recommended dose is 1 tablet once a day. If you take certain medicines your doctor may need to
change the amount of doravirine you take. See  Other medicines and Delstrigo  section for a list of
medicines.
Taking this medicine
* Swallow the tablet whole (do not crush or chew).
* This medicine can be taken with food or between meals.
If you take more Delstrigo than you should
Do not take more than the recommended dose. If you accidentally take more, contact your doctor.
If you forget to take Delstrigo
* It is important that you do not miss or skip doses of Delstrigo.
* If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. But if your next dose is due within
12 hours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your
treatment as before.
* Do not take two doses of Delstrigo at the same time to make up for a missed dose.
* If you are not sure what to do, call your doctor or pharmacist.
If you stop taking Delstrigo
Do not run out of Delstrigo. Refill your prescription or talk to your doctor before your Delstrigo is all
gone.
If you stop taking Delstrigo, your doctor will need to check your health often and do blood tests
regularly for several months to check your HIV infection. If you have HIV infection and hepatitis B
infection, it is especially important not to stop your Delstrigo treatment without talking to your doctor
first. Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has worsened after
stopping lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three active substances of Delstrigo). If
Delstrigo is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis B treatment. You may
need blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. In some
patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may
lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
