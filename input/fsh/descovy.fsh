<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Descovy. </p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Descovy you may still develop infections 
or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Descovy: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have liver problems or have suffered liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a 
higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, 
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have hepatitis B infection, liver problems may become worse after you stop taking 
Descovy.  Do not stop taking Descovy without talking to your doctor: see section 3, Do not stop 
taking Descovy. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your doctor may choose to not prescribe Descovy to you if your virus has a certain resistance 
mutation, as Descovy may not be able to reduce the amount of HIV in your body as effectively. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown problems with your kidneys.  Your 
doctor may order blood tests to monitor how your kidneys work when starting and during 
treatment with Descovy. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While you are taking Descovy </p>
<p>Once you start taking Descovy, look out for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Signs of inflammation or infection </li>
<li>Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems </li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see 
section 4, Possible side effects. </p>
<p>There is a possibility that you may experience kidney problems when taking Descovy over a long 
period of time (see Warnings and precautions). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children aged 11 years or under, or weighing less than 35 kg.  The use 
of Descovy in children aged 11 years or under has not yet been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Descovy </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  Descovy may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Descovy or other 
medicines in your blood may change.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may 
make any side effects worse.  In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your 
blood levels. </p>
<p>Medicines used in treating hepatitis B infection: 
You should not take Descovy with medicines containing: 
* tenofovir alafenamide 
* tenofovir disoproxil 
* lamivudine 
* adefovir dipivoxil </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. </p>
<p>Other types of medicine: 
Talk to your doctor if you are taking: 
* antibiotics, used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis, containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>rifabutin, rifampicin, and rifapentine </li>
<li>
<p>antiviral medicines used to treat HIV:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emtricitabine and tipranavir </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anticonvulsants, used to treat epilepsy, such as:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>herbal remedies used to treat depression and anxiety containing:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking these or any other medicines.  Do not stop your treatment 
without contacting your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant and ask about the potential benefits and 
risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have taken Descovy during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and 
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took 
NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side 
effects. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Descovy.  This is because one of the active substances in 
this medicine passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Descovy can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy when taking Descovy, do not drive and do not use any 
tools or machines. </p>
<p>Descovy contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is: </p>
<p>Adults: one tablet each day, with or without food 
Adolescents 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day with or 
without food </p>
<p>It is recommended not to chew or crush the tablet due to the bitter taste. </p>
<p>If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, you can split it in half.  Take both halves of the 
tablet one after the other to get the full dose.  Do not store the split tablet. </p>
<p>Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine is 
fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the 
dose unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Descovy following completion of dialysis. </p>
<p>If you take more Descovy than you should </p>
<p>If you take more than the recommended dose of Descovy you may be at higher risk of side effects of 
this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). </p>
<p>Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle 
with you so that you can show what you have taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Descovy </p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of Descovy. </p>
<p>If you do miss a dose: 
* If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Descovy, you must take the tablet as 
soon as possible.  Then take the next dose as usual. 
* If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Descovy, then do not take the 
missed dose.  Wait and take the next dose at your usual time. </p>
<p>If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Descovy, take another tablet. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Descovy </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Descovy without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Descovy can seriously affect 
how well future treatment works.  If Descovy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before 
you restart taking Descovy tablets. </p>
<p>When your supply of Descovy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
few days.  The disease may then become harder to treat. </p>
<p>If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is very important not to stop taking Descovy 
without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after stopping 
treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment may lead to 
worsening of hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Possible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately </p>
<ul>
<li>Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and who have had opportunistic infections in the past (infections that occur in people 
with a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections 
may occur soon after antiretroviral treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are 
due to an improvement in the body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections 
that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. </li>
<li>
<p>Autoimmune disorders (the immune system attacks healthy body tissue), may also occur after 
you start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months 
after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>muscle weakness </p>
</li>
<li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body </li>
<li>palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity 
  If you notice the side effects described above, tell your doctor immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Very common side effects 
(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
* feeling sick (nausea) </p>
<p>Common side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* abnormal dreams 
* headache 
* dizziness 
* diarrhoea 
* vomiting 
* stomach pain 
* wind (flatulence) 
* rash 
* tiredness (fatigue) </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* low red blood cell count (anaemia) 
* problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) 
* swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) 
* itching (pruritus) 
* hives (urticaria) 
* joint pain (arthralgia) </p>
<p>If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Other effects that may be seen during HIV treatment </p>
<p>The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available data). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Descovy 
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, 
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of 
the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>joint stiffness </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>difficulty with movement 
  If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. </p>
