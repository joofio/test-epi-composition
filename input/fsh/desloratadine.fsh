Desloratadine ratiopharm is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control 
your allergic reaction and its symptoms. </p>
<p>When Desloratadine ratiopharm should be used 
Desloratadine ratiopharm relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the 
nasal passages caused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults. These 
symptoms include sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy palate, and itchy, red or watery eyes. </p>
<p>Desloratadine ratiopharm is also used to relieve the symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic 
urticaria (a skin condition with unknown cause), initially diagnosed by your doctor. These symptoms 
include itching and hives. </p>
<p>Relief of these symptoms lasts a full day and helps you to resume your normal daily activities and 
sleep. </p>
<p>You must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after 7 days. If you notice 
difficulties in breathing or swelling of lips, tongue or throat you must talk to a doctor immediately. </p>         </div>"""
