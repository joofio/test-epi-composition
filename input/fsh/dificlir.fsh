<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking DIFICLIR. </p>
<p>If you feel that you might have a severe allergic reaction such as trouble breathing (dyspnea), swelling 
of the face or throat (angioedema), severe rash, severe itching (pruritus) or severe hives (urticaria), 
stop taking DIFICLIR and seek medical advice urgently from your doctor, pharmacist or at your local 
hospital emergency department (see section 4). </p>
<p>If you are allergic to macrolides (a class of antibiotics), ask your doctor for advice before using this 
medicine. Your doctor will tell you whether this medicine is suitable for you. </p>
<p>If you have kidney or liver problems, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Your 
doctor will tell you whether this medicine is suitable for you. </p>
<p>There are limited data available on the use of fidaxomicin in severe cases of the disease (e.g. 
pseudomembranous colitis). Your doctor will know whether your disease falls in the severe categories 
and will tell you whether this medicine is suitable for you. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children with a body weight below 12.5 kg, because these children 
require a reduced dose. For appropriate dosing in these patients, DIFICLIR granules for oral 
suspension may be used. </p>
<p>Other medicines and DIFICLIR 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>

organ or bone marrow transplant, for psoriasis or eczema, or for rheumatoid arthritis or

<p>dronedarone and amiodarone (medicines used to control the heartbeat) </p>
<p>dabigatran etexilat (a medicine used to prevent the formation of blood clots after hip or knee 
replacement surgery)<br />
You should not use DIFICLIR in combination with one of these medicines, unless your doctor tells 
you otherwise. If you use one of these medicines, please ask your doctor for advice before taking this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not take DIFICLIR if you are pregnant, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.<br />

taking this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not known whether fidaxomicin passes into breast milk, but it is not expected to do so.
