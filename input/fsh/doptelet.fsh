<p>Doptelet is used in adults with chronic liver disease to treat low platelet count (called 
thrombocytopenia) before having a medical procedure where there is a risk of bleeding. </p>
<p>Doptelet is used to treat adults with low platelet counts due to primary chronic immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) when a prior treatment for ITP (such as corticosteroids or immunoglobulins) 
has not worked well enough. 
Doptelet works by helping to increase the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are blood cells 
that help the blood to clot and so reduce or prevent bleeding. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Doptelet. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Doptelet if: 
* you are at risk of blood clots in your veins or arteries, or members of your family have had 
blood clots.<br />
* you have another blood condition known as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); taking Doptelet

</ul>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking

<p>Blood tests for platelet count 
If you stop taking Doptelet, your platelet count is likely to become low as before treatment or even 
lower, with a risk of bleeding. This may happen within days. The platelet count will be monitored, and 
your doctor will discuss appropriate precautions with you. </p>
<p>Tests to check your bone marrow 
In people who have problems with their bone marrow, medicines like Doptelet could make the 
problems worse. Signs of bone marrow changes may show up as abnormal results in your blood tests. 
Your doctor may also carry out a test to directly check your bone marrow during treatment with 
Doptelet. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give Doptelet to people less than 18 years old. The safety and effectiveness of this medicine in 
this age group is not known. </p>

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>

while you are taking Doptelet. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Doptelet is not recommended in pregnancy and in 
women who are able to have children and are not using contraception. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking Doptelet. This 
medicine can pass into breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide whether the benefit of 
breast-feeding outweighs any possible risks to your baby while you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Doptelet is not expected to affect you being able to drive, cycle or use tools or machines. </p>
<p>Doptelet contains lactose
