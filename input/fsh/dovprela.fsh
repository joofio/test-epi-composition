</ul>
<p>Since pretomanid must be used in combination with other medicines against tuberculosis   linezolid 
and bedaquiline   please make sure that you read the  Do not take  section of the package leaflets for 
these medicines as well. If you are unsure of any information in the package leaflets, please contact 
your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Dovprela if you: 
* have reduced liver function  </p>
<ul>
<li>drink alcohol on a regular basis </li>
<li>have reduced kidney function </li>
<li>have or have had disturbances of the heart rhythm, or if someone in your family has a heart 
rhythm problem </li>
<li>have heart failure </li>
<li>have or have had an underactive thyroid </li>
<li>have reduced blood levels of calcium, magnesium or potassium </li>
</ul>
<p>Liver damage 
There is a risk of liver damage when you are treated with Dovprela, linezolid and bedaquiline. Your 
doctor will therefore monitor you for signs of liver damage and take blood samples before the start of 
treatment and regularly during treatment. 
Tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as: 
* fatigue 
* lack or loss of appetite 
* nausea 
* yellowing of the skin and eyes 
* dark urine 
* abdominal pain 
The doctor will adjust your treatment if your liver is affected. </p>
<p>Reduced number of blood cells 
Treatment with Dovprela, linezolid and bedaquiline can severely reduce the number of blood cells, 
such as blood platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells called neutrophils. Contact your doctor 
immediately about any signs of bruising, bleeding or infections. 
Your doctor will monitor complete blood counts before the start of treatment and regularly during 
treatment. The doctor will adjust your treatment if your blood cell count is reduced. </p>
<p>Nerve disorders in hands, feet or eyes 
Nerve disorders in hands, feet or eyes may occur during treatment. Contact your doctor if you have 
visual problems, or numbness, tingling or burning in your hands or feet during treatment. Your doctor 
will adjust your treatment in these cases. If visual problems occur contact a doctor for a prompt eye 
examination. </p>
<p>Increased blood level of lactic acid 
A disorder of blood over-acidification called lactic acidosis may occur during treatment. Contact your 
doctor if you have recurrent nausea or vomiting. Your doctor may adjust your treatment in these cases. </p>
<p>Heart problems 
A certain heartbeat abnormality known as QT prolongation may occur during treatment. Your doctor 
will therefore perform an ECG before the start of treatment and regularly during treatment. Your 
treatment will be adjusted if heartbeat abnormalities occur. In addition, potassium, calcium and 
magnesium levels will be monitored and corrected if abnormal. </p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of Dovprela has not been studied in combination with medicines other than 
linezolid and bedaquiline and therefore it should not be used as part of any other treatment 
combination. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. This is because it has 
not been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dovprela </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal therapies. These may affect the way Dovprela works or increase the risk 
of side effects. </p>
<p>Avoid treatment with Dovprela and any of the following medicines at the same time. These may 
lower the effect of Dovprela so your treatment may not work; therefore, inform your doctor 
immediately about these: 
* rifampicin, rifamycin, rifapentine, rifabutin: other medicines to treat tuberculosis or certain 
other infections 
* efavirenz, etravirine: medicines to treat HIV infection 
* carbamazepine, phenytoin: medicines to treat epilepsy and certain pain conditions 
* St John s wort: a herbal medicine to treat depression and anxiety </p>
<p>You should also avoid the use of medicines that may have a damaging effect on your liver (other than 
bedaquiline and linezolid). Talk to you doctor who will be able to tell you which medicines this 
applies to. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor if you are using: 
* methotrexate: a medicine to treat severe joint inflammation, cancer and the skin disease 
psoriasis 
* benzylpenicillin, ciprofloxacin: medicines to treat bacterial infections 
* indomethacin: a medicine to treat pain and inflammation 
* ritonavir: a medicine to treat HIV infection </p>
<p>Dovprela with alcohol </p>
<p>Avoid drinking alcohol while being treated with Dovprela since this increases the risk of serious liver 
damage. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy 
Very limited knowledge exists about the use of Dovprela during pregnancy. Therefore, 
Dovprela is used during pregnancy only if the benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk 
to the foetus. Your doctor will decide whether you should be treated with Dovprela. </li>
<li>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if pretomanid is passed into human milk. Your doctor has to decide if you 
should discontinue breast-feeding or avoid treatment with Dovprela.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You may feel dizzy after taking Dovprela or you may experience problems with your vision. Do not 
drive or operate machinery if this happens. </p>
<p>Dovprela contains lactose and sodium </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Dovprela is used in combination with linezolid and bedaquiline. Please also read the package leaflets 
from these medicines. If you have any questions ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is<br />
* Dovprela: 1 tablet once daily 
* linezolid: 600 mg daily 
* bedaquiline: 400 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg 3 times per week (with at least 
48 hours between doses). For example you may take bedaquiline on Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday every week from week 3 onwards. </p>
<p>Method of use 
Take Dovprela at the same time as linezolid and bedaquiline. Swallow the tablets with a glass of water 
and take them with food. 
The tablets are taken under direct observation of a healthcare professional or in accordance with local 
practice.  </p>
<p>Duration of use 
The duration of treatment with the combination Dovprela, linezolid and bedaquiline is 26 weeks. Your 
doctor may decide to expand this period or to interrupt dosing to ensure that the treatment is safe and 
effective for you. </p>
<p>If you take more Dovprela than you should </p>
<p>Contact your doctor straight away and take the medicine pack with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Dovprela </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>Any missed dose of pretomanid and bedaquiline is recommended to be made up at the end of 
treatment. Doses of linezolid missed due to linezolid adverse reactions are not recommended to be 
made up. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have missed a dose and you are not sure what to do. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Dovprela </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Dovprela or its combination medicines linezolid or bedaquiline without your 
doctor s permission. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may make treatment 
ineffective and your tuberculosis could get worse. In addition, this would increase the chance that 
bacteria become resistant to these medicines. </p>
