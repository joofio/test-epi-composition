<p>DUAVIVE is used in postmenopausal women who still have their uterus (womb) and have not had a

<p>DUAVIVE is used for: </p>
<p>Relief of symptoms occurring after menopause </p>
<p>During the menopause, the amount of the oestrogen produced by a woman s body drops. This can 
cause symptoms such as hot face, neck and chest ("hot flushes"). DUAVIVE alleviates these 
symptoms after menopause. You will only be prescribed this medicine if your symptoms seriously 
hinder your daily life and your doctor determines that other types of HRT are not appropriate for you. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Medical history and regular check-ups </p>
<p>The use of DUAVIVE carries risks, which need to be considered when deciding whether to start 
taking it, or whether to carry on taking it.  </p>
<p>There is no experience in treating women with a premature menopause (due to ovarian failure or 
surgery) with DUAVIVE. </p>
<p>Before you start taking this medicine, your doctor will ask you about your own and your family s 
medical history. Your doctor may decide to perform a physical examination. This may include an 
examination of your breasts and/or an internal examination, if necessary, or if you have any special 
concerns. Tell your doctor if you have any medical problems or illnesses. </p>
<p>Once you have started this medicine you should see your doctor for regular check-ups (at least once a 
year). During these check-ups, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of continuing with 
DUAVIVE. You are advised to: </p>
<p>go for regular breast screening and cervical smear tests, as recommended by your doctor. </p>
<p>regularly check your breasts for any changes such as dimpling of the skin, changes in the 
nipple, or any lumps you can see or feel. </p>
<p>Do not take DUAVIVE<br />
- If you are allergic to conjugated oestrogens, bazedoxifene or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6).<br />
- If you have or have ever had breast cancer, or if you are suspected of having it. 
- If you have or have had cancer which is sensitive to oestrogens, such as cancer of the 
womb lining (endometrium), or if you are suspected of having it. 
- If you have recently had any unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
- If you have excessive thickening of the womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) that is 
not being treated. 
- If you have or have ever had a blood clot in a vein (thrombosis), such as in the legs 
(deep venous thrombosis), the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or eyes (retinal vein 
thrombosis). 
- If you have a blood clotting disorder (such as protein C, protein S, or antithrombin 
deficiency). 
- If you have or recently have had a disease caused by blood clots in the arteries, such as a 
heart attack, stroke or angina.<br />
- If you have or have ever had liver disease and your liver function tests have not returned 
to normal. 
- If you are pregnant or could still become pregnant or you are breast-feeding. 
- If you have a rare blood problem called porphyria, which is passed down in families 
(inherited).  </p>
<p>If you are not sure about any of the points above, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.<br />
If any of the above conditions appear for the first time while taking this medicine, stop taking it at 
once and consult your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you have ever had any of the following problems, as 
these may return or become worse during treatment with DUAVIVE. If so, you should see your doctor 
more often for check-ups: </p>
<p>fibroids inside your womb </p>
<p>growth of womb lining outside your womb (endometriosis) or a history of excessive growth 
of the womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) </p>
<p>increased risk of developing blood clots [see  Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis) ] </p>
<p>increased risk of getting a oestrogen-sensitive cancer (such as having a mother, sister or 
grandmother who has had breast cancer)  </p>
<p>high blood pressure </p>
<p>a liver disorder, such as a benign liver tumour </p>
<p>diabetes  </p>
<p>gallstones  </p>
<p>migraine or severe headaches </p>
<p>a rare disease of the immune system that affects many organs of the body (systemic lupus 
erythematosus, SLE) </p>
<p>seizures (epilepsy) </p>
<p>asthma </p>
<p>a disease affecting the eardrum and hearing (otosclerosis) </p>
<p>a high level of fat in your blood (triglycerides) </p>
<p>fluid retention due to cardiac or kidney problems </p>
<p>Stop taking DUAVIVE and see a doctor immediately </p>
<p>If you notice any of the following: </p>
<p>any of the conditions mentioned under  Do not take DUAVIVE  </p>
<p>yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice). These may be signs of a 
liver disease </p>
<p>a large increase in your blood pressure (symptoms may be headache, tiredness, dizziness) </p>
<p>migraine-like headaches which happen for the first time </p>
<p>if you become pregnant </p>
<p>you notice signs of a blood clot, such as painful swelling and redness of the legs, sudden 
chest pain, or difficulty in breathing. For more information, see  Blood clots in a vein 
(thrombosis)  </p>
<p>DUAVIVE and cancer  </p>
<p>Excessive thickening of the lining of the womb (endometrial hyperplasia) and cancer of the lining 
of the womb (endometrial cancer) 
This medicine contains conjugated oestrogens and bazedoxifene and is used to treat women with a 
uterus (womb). </p>
<p>When you take DUAVIVE do not take additional oestrogens as this may increase the risk of 
endometrial hyperplasia. </p>
<p>If you have any unexpected vaginal bleeding, you must contact your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Breast cancer<br />
Evidence shows that taking oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of 
breast cancer. The extra risk depends on how long you use HRT. The additional risk becomes clear 
within 3 years of use. After stopping HRT the extra risk will decrease with time, but the risk may 
persist for 10 years or more if you have used HRT for more than 5 years. </p>
<p>The effect of DUAVIVE on the risk of breast cancer might be in the same range as with 
oestrogen-progestin combination HRT. </p>
<p>Regularly check your breasts. See your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any changes, such 
as: </p>
<p>dimpling of the skin </p>
<p>changes in the nipple </p>
<p>any lumps you can see or feel </p>
<p>Ovarian cancer 
Ovarian cancer is rare-much rarer than breast cancer. The use of oestrogen-only HRT has been 
associated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer. </p>
<p>The risk of ovarian cancer varies with age. For example, in women aged 50 to 54 who are not taking 
HRT, about 2 women in 2,000 will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer over a 5-year period. For women 
who have been taking HRT for 5 years, there will be about 3 cases per 2,000 users (i.e. about 1 extra 
case). Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.  </p>
<p>The effect of DUAVIVE on the risk of ovarian cancer is unknown. </p>
<p>DUAVIVE and your heart or circulation </p>
<p>Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis) 
DUAVIVE may increase the risk of blood clots. </p>
<p>Oestrogen-only and bazedoxifene monotherapy increase the risk of blood clots in the veins (also called 
deep vein thrombosis, or DVT), especially during the first year of taking these medicines.  </p>
<p>Blood clots can be serious, and if one travels to the lungs, it can cause chest pain, breathlessness, 
collapse or even death. </p>
<p>Since you are more likely to get a blood clot in your veins as you get older and if any of the following 
applies to you, inform your doctor promptly: </p>
<p>if you are unable to walk for a long time because of major surgery, injury or illness (see 
also section 3, if you need to have surgery) </p>
<p>if you are seriously overweight (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2) </p>
<p>if you have any blood clotting problem that needs long-term treatment with a medicine 
used to prevent blood clots </p>
<p>if any of your close relatives has ever had a blood clot in the leg, lung or another organ </p>
<p>if you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). </p>
<p>if you have cancer. </p>
<p>If any of these conditions apply to you, talk to your doctor before you take this medicine. </p>
<p>Heart disease (heart attack) 
There is no evidence that HRT will prevent a heart attack. Randomised controlled data found no 
increased risk of coronary artery disease in hysterectomised women using oestrogen-only therapy.  </p>
<p>Stroke 
The risk of having a stroke is about 1.5 times higher in HRT users than in non-users. The number of 
extra cases of stroke due to use of HRT will increase with age.  </p>
<p>For women in their 50s who are not taking HRT, on average, 8 in 1,000 would be expected to have a 
stroke over a 5-year period. For women in their 50s who are taking HRT, there will be 11 cases in 
1,000 users, over 5 years (i.e., 3 extra cases). </p>
<p>The effect of DUAVIVE on the risk of stroke might be in the same range as with oestrogen-progestin 
combination HRT. </p>
<p>Other things that can increase the risk of stroke include: </p>
<p>getting older </p>
<p>high blood pressure </p>
<p>smoking </p>
<p>drinking too much alcohol </p>
<p>an irregular heartbeat </p>
<p>If you are having an operation  </p>
<p>If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon you are taking DUAVIVE. You may need to stop 
taking DUAVIVE about 4 to 6 weeks before the operation, to reduce the risk of a blood clot (see 
Blood clots in a vein). Ask your doctor when you can start taking this medicine again. </p>
<p>In case of doubt, talk to your doctor before you take this medicine. </p>
<p>Other conditions </p>
<p>If you have any of the following your doctor should monitor you:</p>
<ul>
<li>kidney problems </li>
<li>pre-existing high level of fat in your blood (triglycerides) </li>
<li>liver problems </li>
<li>asthma </li>
<li>seizures (epilepsy) </li>
<li>migraine  </li>
<li>systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE   a rare disease of the immune system that affects 
many organs of the body) </li>
<li>fluid retention </li>
</ul>
<p>Oestrogen therapy will not prevent memory loss. There is some evidence of a higher risk of memory 
loss in women who start using oestrogen therapy after the age of 65. Speak to your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and DUAVIVE </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may interfere with the effect of DUAVIVE. This might lead to irregular bleeding. 
This applies to the following medicines: </p>
<p>Medicines for epilepsy (such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine); </p>
<p>Medicines for tuberculosis (such as rifampicin, rifabutin); </p>
<p>Medicines for HIV infection (such as nevirapine, efavirenz, ritonavir and nelfinavir); 
  Herbal remedies containing St John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>This medicine is for use only by postmenopausal women. Do not take this medicine if you are 
pregnant, or if you think you might be pregnant. Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>DUAVIVE has a minor effect on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>If you feel drowsy after taking this medicine, you should avoid driving or operating machines.  </p>
<p>The bazedoxifene component of this medicine has been reported to cause problems with eyesight such 
as blurred vision. If this happens, you should avoid driving or operating machines until your doctor 
tells you that it is safe to do so. </p>
<p>DUAVIVE contains lactose, sucrose, maltitol liquid, glucose and sorbitol </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before using this medicinal product. 
This medicine contains 0.0088 mg sorbitol in each tablet. </p>         </div>"""
