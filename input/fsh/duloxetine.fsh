<p>Duloxetine Zentiva is used in adults to treat: 
* depression; 
* generalised anxiety disorder (chronic feeling of anxiety or nervousness);

<p>Duloxetine Zentiva starts to work in most people with depression or anxiety within two weeks of 
starting treatment, but it may take 2-4 weeks before you feel better. Tell your doctor if you do not start 
to feel better after this time. Your doctor may continue to give you Duloxetine Zentiva when you are 
feeling better to prevent your depression or anxiety from returning. </p>

</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. Your doctor will tell you if you 
should be taking Duloxetine Zentiva. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
The following are reasons why Duloxetine Zentiva may not be suitable for you. Talk to your doctor 
before taking Duloxetine Zentiva if you: 
* are taking other medicines to treat depression (see  Other medicines and Duloxetine Zentiva ); 
* are taking St. John s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum); 
* have kidney disease; 
* have had seizures (fits); 
* have had mania; 
* suffer from bipolar disorder; 
* have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye); 
* have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises), especially if you are 
pregnant (see  Pregnancy and breast-feeding ); 
* are at risk of low sodium levels (for example if you are taking diuretics, especially if you are 
elderly); 
* are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage; 
* are taking any opioid medicines such as buprenorphine containing medicine, tramadol and 
pethidine. The use of these medicines together with Duloxetine Zentiva can lead to serotonin 
syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition (see  Other medicines and Duloxetine 
Zentiva ); 
* are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see  Other medicines and Duloxetine 
Zentiva ). </p>
<p>Duloxetine Zentiva may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. You 
should tell your doctor if this happens to you. </p>
<p>Medicines like Duloxetine Zentiva (so called SSRIs/SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual 
dysfunction (see section 4). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Thoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder 
If you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or 
killing yourself. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all 
take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. 
You may be more likely to think like this if you: 
* have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself; 
* are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal 
behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an 
antidepressant. </p>
<p>If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a 
hospital straight away. </p>
<p>You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety 
disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression 
or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents under 18 years of age 
Duloxetine Zentiva should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. Also, 
you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, 
suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when 
they take this class of medicines. Despite this, your doctor may prescribe Duloxetine Zentiva for </p>
<p>patients under 18 because he/she decides that this is in their best interests. If your doctor has 
prescribed Duloxetine Zentiva for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to 
your doctor. You should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen 
when patients under 18 are taking Duloxetine Zentiva. Also, the long-term safety effects concerning 
growth, maturation, and cognitive and behavioural development of duloxetine in this age group have 
not yet been demonstrated. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Duloxetine Zentiva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>The main ingredient of Duloxetine Zentiva, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions: 
diabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence. Using more than one of these 
medicines at the same time should be avoided. Check with your doctor if you are already taking other 
medicines containing duloxetine. </p>
<p>Your doctor should decide whether you can take Duloxetine Zentiva with other medicines. Do not 
start or stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal 
remedies, before checking with your doctor. </p>
<p>You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): You should not take Duloxetine Zentiva if you are 
taking, or have recently taken (within the last 14 days) another antidepressant medicine called a 
monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Examples of MAOIs include moclobemide (an 
antidepressant) and linezolid (an antibiotic). Taking a MAOI together with many prescription 
medicines, including Duloxetine Zentiva, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects. 
You must wait at least 14 days after you have stopped taking an MAOI before you can take 
Duloxetine Zentiva. Also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you stop taking Duloxetine 
Zentiva before you take a MAOI. </li>
<li>Medicines that cause sleepiness: These include medicines prescribed by your doctor including 
benzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and antihistamines. </li>
<li>Medicines that increase the level of serotonin: Triptans, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as 
paroxetine and fluoxetine), SNRIs (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as 
clomipramine, amitriptyline), St. John s Wort, MAOIs (such as moclobemide and linezolid) and 
opioid medicines such as buprenorphine containing medicine, tramadol and pethidine. These 
medicines increase the risk of side effects such as serotonin syndrome (see section  Warnings 
and precautions ). If you get any unusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with 
Duloxetine Zentiva, you should see your doctor. </li>
<li>Oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: Medicines which thin the blood or prevent the 
blood from clotting. These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. </li>
</ul>
<p>Duloxetine Zentiva with food, drink and alcohol 
Duloxetine Zentiva may be taken with or without food. Care should be taken if you drink alcohol 
while you are being treated with Duloxetine Zentiva. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are 
taking Duloxetine Zentiva. You should use Duloxetine Zentiva only after discussing the 
potential benefits and any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on Duloxetine Zentiva. When taken 
during pregnancy, similar drugs (SSRIs) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, 
called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>faster and appear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby 
is born. If this happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor 
immediately. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you take Duloxetine Zentiva near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some 
symptoms when it is born. These usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being 
born. These symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, 
trouble with breathing and fits. If your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you 
are concerned about your baby s health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to 
advise you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you take Duloxetine Zentiva near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of 
excessive vaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding 
disorders. Your doctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can 
advise you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available data from the use of duloxetine during the first three months of pregnancy do not 
show an increased risk of overall birth defects in general in the child. If duloxetine is taken 
during the second half of pregnancy, there may be an increased risk that the infant will be born 
early (6 additional premature infants for every 100 women who take duloxetine in the second 
half of pregnancy), mostly between weeks 35 and 36 of pregnancy.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. The use of Duloxetine Zentiva while breast-feeding is 
not recommended. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Duloxetine Zentiva may make you feel sleepy or dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines 
until you know how Duloxetine Zentiva affects you. </p>
<p>Duloxetine Zentiva contains sucrose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. </p>         </div>"""

be adjusted up to 120 mg a day based on your response to Duloxetine Zentiva. </p>
<p>To help you remember to take Duloxetine Zentiva, you may find it easier to take it at the same times 
every day. </p>
<p>Talk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking Duloxetine Zentiva. Do not stop taking 
Duloxetine Zentiva, or change your dose, without talking to your doctor. Treating your disorder 
properly is important to help you get better. If it is not treated, your condition may not go away and 
may become more serious and difficult to treat. </p>
<p>If you take more Duloxetine Zentiva than you should 
Call your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of Duloxetine Zentiva 
prescribed by your doctor. Symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a 
rare reaction which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, 
feeling of being drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Duloxetine Zentiva 
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the 
missed dose and take only a single dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
dose. Do not take more than the daily amount of Duloxetine Zentiva that has been prescribed for you 
in one day. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Duloxetine Zentiva 
DO NOT stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. If your 
doctor thinks that you no longer need Duloxetine Zentiva he or she will ask you to reduce your dose 
over at least 2 weeks before stopping treatment altogether. </p>
<p>Some patients who stop taking Duloxetine Zentiva suddenly have had symptoms such as: 
* dizziness, tingling, feelings like pins and needles or electric shock-like feelings (particularly in 
the head), sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), fatigue, sleepiness, 
feeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), 
shaking (tremor), headaches, muscle pain, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or 
vertigo. 
These symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms 
that are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice. </p>
