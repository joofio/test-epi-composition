called antiplatelet medicinal products. Platelets are very small structures in the blood which clump 
together during blood clotting. By preventing this clumping in some types of blood vessels (called 
arteries), antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of blood clots forming (a process called 
atherothrombosis). </p>
<p>DuoPlavin is taken by adults to prevent blood clots forming in hardened arteries which can lead to 
atherothrombotic events (such as stroke, heart attack, or death).  </p>
<p>You have been prescribed DuoPlavin in place of the two separate medicines, clopidogrel and ASA, to 
help prevent blood clots because you have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as  unstable 
angina  or heart attack (myocardial infarction). For the treatment of this condition your doctor may 
have placed a stent in the blocked or narrowed artery to restore effective blood flow. </p>         </div>"""

<em> if you are allergic to clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6).<br />
</em> if you are allergic to other products called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products usually used 
to treat painful and/or inflammatory conditions of muscles or joints. 
* if you have a medical condition that includes the combination of asthma, nasal discharge (runny 
nose) and polyps (a type of growth in the nose). 
* if you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or 
bleeding within the brain. 
* if you suffer from severe liver disease. 
* if you suffer from severe kidney disease. 
* if you are in your last trimester of pregnancy.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>If any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking 
DuoPlavin: 
* if you have a risk of bleeding such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer). </li>
<li>a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, 
organs or joints of your body). </li>
<li>a recent serious injury. </li>
<li>a recent surgery (including dental). </li>
<li>a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days. </li>
<li>if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred in the last 
seven days. </li>
<li>if you have kidney or liver disease. </li>
<li>if you have a history of asthma or allergic reactions including allergy to any medicine used to 
treat your disease.  </li>
<li>if you have gout.  </li>
<li>if you drink alcohol, because of the increased risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal injury.  </li>
<li>if you have a condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency 
because of the risk of a particular form of anaemia (low number of red blood cells). </li>
</ul>
<p>While you are taking DuoPlavin: 
* You should tell your doctor 
- if a surgery (including dental) is planned. 
- if you have any stomach or abdominal pain or bleeding in the stomach or bowels (red 
stools or black stools). 
* You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition known as 
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP that includes fever and bruising under the skin 
that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, 
yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4). 
* If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked to 
the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor cuts and 
injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you are 
concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4. Possible side effects ). 
* Your doctor may order blood tests. 
* You should tell your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms or signs of Drug Reaction 
with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) which may include flu-like symptoms and 
a rash with fever, enlarged lymph nodes and increase in a type of white blood cell (eosinophilia). 
Other abnormal blood test results may include (but are not limited to) increased levels of liver 
enzymes (see section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
DuoPlavin is not intended for use in children or adolescents less than 18 years of age. There is a 
possible association between acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and Reye s Syndrome when products 
containing ASA are given to children or adolescents with a viral infection. Reye s Syndrome is a very 
rare disease which can be fatal. </p>
<p>Other medicines and DuoPlavin 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some other medicines may influence the use of DuoPlavin or vice versa. </p>
<p>You should specifically tell your doctor if you take 
* medicines that may increase your risk of bleeding such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>oral anticoagulants, medicines used to reduce blood clotting,  </li>
<li>ASA or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine usually used to treat painful 
and/or inflammatory conditions of muscle or joints, </li>
<li>heparin or any other injectable medicine used to reduce blood clotting, </li>
<li>ticlopidine, or other antiplatelet agents, </li>
<li>a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (including but not restricted to fluoxetine or 
fluvoxamine), medicines usually used to treat depression, </li>
<li>rifampicin (used to treat severe infections) </li>
<li>omeprazole or esomeprazole, medicines to treat upset stomach, </li>
<li>methotrexate, a medicine used to treat severe joint disease (rheumatoid arthritis) or skin disease 
(psoriasis),  </li>

increase urine flow, </li>
<li>probenecid, benzbromarone, or sulfinpyrazone, medicines used to treat gout, </li>
<li>fluconazole or voriconazole, medicines to treat fungal infections,  </li>

<li>repaglinide, medicine to treat diabetes,  </li>
<li>paclitaxel, medicine to treat cancer, </li>
<li>nicorandil, medicine to treat cardiac chest pain, </li>

prescribed any opioids (used to treat severe pain), </li>
<li>rosuvastatin (used to lower your cholesterol level). </li>
</ul>
<p>You should stop other clopidogrel treatment while you are taking DuoPlavin. </p>
<p>An occasional use of ASA (no more than 1,000 mg in any 24-hour period) should generally not cause 
a problem, but prolonged use of ASA in other circumstances should be discussed with your doctor or 
pharmacist. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Do not take DuoPlavin during third trimester of pregnancy. 
It is preferable not to take this medicine during first and second trimesters of pregnancy. </p>
