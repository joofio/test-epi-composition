  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>DuoResp Spiromax contains two different active substances: budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. </p>
<ul>
<li>Budesonide belongs to a group of medicines called ‘corticosteroids’ also known as ‘steroids’.  It works 
by reducing and preventing swelling and inflammation in your lungs and helps you to breathe more 
easily.  </li>
<li>Formoterol fumarate dihydrate belongs to a group of medicines called ‘long-acting β2 adrenoceptor 
agonists’ or ‘bronchodilators’.  It works by relaxing the muscles in your airways. This will help to open 
the airways and help you to breathe more easily. </li>
</ul>
<p>DuoResp Spiromax is indicated for use in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older only.  </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  </p>
<p>Asthma 
DuoResp Spiromax can be prescribed for asthma in two different ways. </p>
<p>a)  You may be prescribed two asthma inhalers: DuoResp Spiromax together with a separate ‘reliever 
inhaler’ such as salbutamol. 
* Use DuoResp Spiromax every day.  This helps to prevent asthma symptoms such as breathlessness and 
wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use the ‘reliever inhaler’ when you get asthma symptoms, to make it easier to breathe again.  </p>
<p>b)  You may be prescribed DuoResp Spiromax as your only asthma inhaler. 
* Use DuoResp Spiromax every day.  This helps to prevent asthma symptoms such as breathlessness and 
wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use DuoResp Spiromax when you need to take extra inhalations or puffs for relief of asthma symptoms, 
to make it easier to breathe again and if agreed with the doctor also to prevent asthma symptoms from 
happening (for example, when exercising or on exposure to allergens).  They do not need a separate 
inhaler for this.  </p>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
COPD is a long-term lung disease of the airways in the lungs, which is often caused by cigarette smoking.<br />
Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest discomfort and coughing up mucus. DuoResp Spiromax 
can also be used to treat the symptoms of severe COPD in adults only.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you have been taking steroid tablets for your asthma or COPD, your doctor may reduce the number of 
tablets that you take, once you start to use DuoResp Spiromax. If you have been taking steroid tablets for a 
long time, your doctor may want you to have regular blood tests. When reducing steroid tablets, you may 
feel generally unwell even though your chest symptoms may be improving. You might experience symptoms 
such as a stuffy or runny nose, weakness or joint or muscle pain and rash (eczema). If any of these symptoms 
bother you, or if symptoms such as headache, tiredness, nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting (being sick) occur, 
please contact your doctor immediately. You may need to take other medicines if you develop allergic or 
arthritic symptoms. You should speak to your doctor if you are concerned as to whether you should continue 
to use DuoResp Spiromax. </p>
<p>Your doctor may consider adding steroid tablets to your usual treatment if you have an illness such as a chest 
infection or before an operation. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 12 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and DuoResp Spiromax 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* β blockers (such as atenolol or propranolol for high blood pressure or a heart condition), including 
eyedrops (such as timolol for glaucoma). 
* Oxytocin which is given to pregnant women to induce labour 
* Medicines for a fast or uneven heartbeat (such as quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide and 
terfenadine). 
* Medicines like digoxin, often used to treat heart failure. 
* Diuretics, also known as ‘water tablets’ (such as furosemide).  These are used to treat high blood 
pressure. 
* Steroid tablets that you take by mouth (such as prednisolone). 
* Xanthine medicines (such as theophylline or aminophylline).  These are often used to treat asthma. 
* Other bronchodilators (such as salbutamol). 
* Tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline) and the antidepressant nefazodone.<br />
<em> Antidepressant medicines such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and those with similar properties (such 
as the antibiotic furazolidone and the chemotherapy medicine procarbazine). 
* Antipsychotic phenothiazine medicines (such as chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine).<br />
</em> Medicines called ‘HIV protease inhibitors’ (such as ritonavir) to treat HIV infection. 
* Medicines to treat infections (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, 
clarithromycin and telithromycin).<br />
* Medicines for Parkinson’s disease (such as levodopa).

<em> If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking DuoResp Spiromax - do NOT use this 
medicine unless your doctor tells you to.<br />
</em> If you get pregnant while using DuoResp Spiromax, do NOT stop using DuoResp Spiromax but talk to 
your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
DuoResp Spiromax is not likely to affect your ability to drive or to use tools or machines. </p>

<ul>
<li>It is important to use DuoResp Spiromax every day, even if you have no asthma or COPD symptoms at 
the time.  </li>
<li>If you are using DuoResp Spiromax for asthma, your doctor will want to regularly check your 
symptoms.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Asthma<br />
DuoResp Spiromax can be prescribed for asthma in two different ways. The amount of DuoResp Spiromax 
to use and when to use it depends on how it has been prescribed for you.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have been prescribed DuoResp Spiromax and a separate reliever inhaler, read the section called 
(A) Using DuoResp Spiromax and a separate ‘reliever inhaler’.  </li>
<li>If you have been prescribed DuoResp Spiromax as your only inhaler, read the section called (B) Using 
DuoResp Spiromax as your only asthma inhaler. </li>
</ul>
<p>(A) Using DuoResp Spiromax and a separate ‘reliever inhaler’  </p>
<p>Use your DuoResp Spiromax every day. This helps to prevent asthma symptoms from occurring. </p>
<p>Recommended dose:<br />
Adults (18 years and older) 
1 or 2 inhalations (actuations), twice a day, taken in the morning and in the evening<br />
Your doctor may increase this to 4 inhalations, twice a day. 
If your symptoms are well controlled, your doctor may ask you to take your medicine once a day. </p>
<p>Adolescents (12 years and older) 
1 or 2 inhalations twice daily. </p>
<p>Your doctor will help you to manage your asthma and will adjust the dose of this medicine to the lowest dose 
that controls your asthma.  If your doctor feels that you need a lower dose than is available from your 
DuoResp Spiromax, your doctor may prescribe an alternative inhaler containing the same active substances 
as your DuoResp Spiromax but with a lower dose of the corticosteroid. If your symptoms are well controlled, 
your doctor may ask you to take your medicine once a day. However, do not adjust the number of inhalations 
your doctor has prescribed without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Use your separate ‘reliever inhaler’ to treat asthma symptoms when they happen.<br />
Always keep your ‘reliever inhaler’ with you and use it to relieve sudden attacks of breathlessness and 
wheezing.  Do not use DuoResp Spiromax to treat these asthma symptoms. </p>
<p>(B) Using DuoResp Spiromax as your only asthma inhaler </p>
<p>Only use DuoResp Spiromax in this way if your doctor has told you to.  </p>
<p>Use your DuoResp Spiromax every day. This helps to prevent asthma symptoms from occurring. </p>
<p>Recommended dose<br />
Adults and adolescents (12 years and older) </p>
<p>1 inhalation in the morning and 1 inhalation in the evening 
or 
2 inhalations in the morning<br />
or 
2 inhalations in the evening. </p>
<p>Your doctor may increase this to 2 inhalations twice a day.  </p>
<p>Also use DuoResp Spiromax as a ‘reliever inhaler’ to treat asthma symptoms when they happen and to 
prevent asthma symptoms from happening (for example, when exercising or on exposure to allergens). 
* If you get asthma symptoms, take 1 inhalation and wait a few minutes.<br />
<em> If you do not feel better, take another inhalation.<br />
</em> Do not take more than 6 inhalations at a single time. </p>
<p>Always keep your DuoResp Spiromax with you and use it to relieve sudden attacks of breathlessness and 
wheezing. </p>
<p>A total daily dose of more than 8 inhalations is not normally needed.  However, your doctor may allow you 
to take up to 12 inhalations a day for a limited period.  </p>
<p>If you regularly need to use 8 or more inhalations a day, make an appointment to see your doctor.  They may 
need to change your treatment.  </p>
<p>Do NOT use more than 12 inhalations in total in 24 hours. </p>
<p>If you are doing exercise and you get asthma symptoms, use DuoResp Spiromax as described here.<br />
However, do not use DuoResp Spiromax just before exercise to stop asthma symptoms from happening. It is 
important that you discuss with your doctor the use of DuoResp Spiromax to prevent asthma symptoms from 
happening; how often you exercise or how often you are exposed to allergens could impact the treatment that 
is prescribed to you. </p>
<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) </p>
<p>Recommended dose: 
Adults (18 years and older) only: 
2 inhalations twice a day, taken in the morning and in the evening. </p>
<p>Your doctor may also prescribe another bronchodilator medicine, for example an anticholinergic (such as 
tiotropium or ipratropium bromide) for your COPD disease. </p>
<p>Preparing your new DuoResp Spiromax  </p>
<p>Before using your new DuoResp Spiromax for the first time, you need to prepare it for use as follows: 
* Open the foil pouch by tearing at the notch at the top of the foil pouch and take out the inhaler<br />
* Check the dose indicator to see that there are 120 inhalations in the inhaler. 
* Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label of the inhaler. 
* Do not shake your inhaler before use. </p>
