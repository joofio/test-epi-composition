  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Dupixent is 
Dupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. </p>
<p>Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins 
called interleukins (IL)-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of 
atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prurigo nodularis 
(PN) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). </p>
<p>What Dupixent is used for 
Dupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 months to 11 years 
old with severe atopic dermatitis. Dupixent may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the 
skin or it may be used on its own.  </p>
<p>Dupixent is also used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in 
adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older whose asthma is not controlled with their 
current asthma medicines (e.g. corticosteroids). </p>
<p>Dupixent is also used with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of CRSwNP in adults whose 
disease is not controlled with their current CRSwNP medicines. Dupixent can also reduce the need for 
surgery and the need for systemic corticosteroid use. </p>
<p>Dupixent is also used to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN), also known as 
chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG). Dupixent may be used with PN medicines that you apply to the skin 
or it may be used on its own. </p>
<p>Dupixent is also used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg, with 
eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). </p>
<p>How Dupixent works 
Using Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and 
reduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression 
associated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and 
overall quality of life. </p>
<p>Dupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. 
Dupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your 
asthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your 
breathing. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Dupixent. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: </p>
<p>Dupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. </p>
<p>Every time you get a new pack of Dupixent, it is important that you note down the date and the batch 
number (which is on the packaging after  Lot ) and keep this information in a safe place. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
* Rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and 
anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven days 
after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing 
problems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling 
lightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, 
joint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under  Serious side 
effects  in section 4. * Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
of an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Eosinophilic conditions 
* Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs 
due to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). 
* It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in 
people who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being 
lowered. 
* Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, 
pins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. </p>
<p>Parasitic (intestinal parasites) infection 
* Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a 
parasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. 
* Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration 
which could be a sign of a parasitic infection. 
* If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region 
check with your doctor. </p>
<p>Asthma 
If you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine 
without talking to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you stop Dupixent or if your asthma remains 
uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine. </p>
<p>Eye problems 
Talk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in 
vision. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
* The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with atopic dermatitis below the 
age of 6 months. 
* The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with asthma below the age of 6 
years. 
* The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with CRSwNP below the age of 
18 years. 
* The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not known in children with PN below the age of 18 years.<br />
* The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with EoE below the age of years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dupixent 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist<br />
* if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
* if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination. </p>
<p>Other medicines for asthma 
Do not stop or reduce your asthma medicines, unless instructed by your doctor. 
* These medicines (especially ones called corticosteroids) must be stopped gradually. 
* This must be done under the direct supervision of your doctor and dependent on your response to 
Dupixent. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
* If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known; 
therefore, it is preferable to avoid the use of Dupixent in pregnancy unless your doctor advises to 
use it. 
* If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Dupixent. You should 
not do both. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Dupixent is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Dupixent contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 300 mg dose, that is to say essentially
