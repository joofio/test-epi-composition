<p>Dynastat is used for the short-term treatment of pain in adults after an operation. It is one of a family 
of medicines called COX-2 inhibitors (this is short for cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors). Pain and 
swelling are sometimes caused by substances in the body called prostaglandins. Dynastat works by 
lowering the amount of these prostaglandins. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dynastat can lead to an increase in blood pressure or worsening of existing high blood pressure which 
may result in an increase in side effects associated with heart conditions. Your doctor may want to 
monitor your blood pressure during treatment with Dynastat. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents under the age of 18 should not be given Dynastat. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dynastat 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Medicines can sometimes interfere with each other. Your doctor may reduce the dose of Dynastat or 
other medicines, or you may need to take a different medicine. It s especially important to mention: 
* Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or other anti-inflammatory medicines 
* Fluconazole   used for fungal infections 
* ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin-II inhibitors, beta blockers and diuretics   used for high blood 
pressure and heart conditions 
* Ciclosporin or Tacrolimus   used after transplants 
* Warfarin   or other warfarin like medicines used to prevent blood clots including newer medicines 
like apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban 
* Lithium   used to treat depression 
* Rifampicin   used for bacterial infections 
* Antiarrhythmics   used to treat an irregular heartbeat 
* Phenytoin or Carbamazepine   used for epilepsy 
* Methotrexate   used for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer 
* Diazepam   used for sedation and anxiety 
* Omeprazole   used for treating ulcers </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
* Dynastat must not be used if you are in the last 3 months of pregnancy as it could harm your 
unborn child or cause problems at delivery. It can cause kidney and heart problems in your unborn 
baby. It may affect your and your baby s tendency to bleed and cause labour to be later or longer 
than expected. Dynastat should not be used during the first 6 months of pregnancy unless 
absolutely necessary and advised by your doctor. If you need treatment during this period or while 
you are trying to get pregnant, the lowest dose for the shortest time possible should be used. If 
used for more than a few days from 20 weeks of pregnancy onward, Dynastat can cause kidney 
problems in your unborn baby that may lead to low levels of amniotic fluid that surrounds the 
baby (oligohydramnios) or narrowing of a blood vessel (ductus arteriosus) in the heart of the baby. 
If you need treatment for longer than a few days, your doctor may recommend additional 
monitoring. 
* If you are breast-feeding, you must not receive Dynastat, as a small amount of Dynastat will be 
transferred to your breast milk. 
* NSAIDs, including Dynastat, may make it more difficult to become pregnant. You should tell 
your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant or if you have problems becoming pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If the injection makes you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or use machines until you feel better again. </p>
<p>Dynastat contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .  </p>         </div>"""
