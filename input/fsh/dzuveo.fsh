- if you are allergic to sufentanil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have a serious lung or breathing problem. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Dzuveo. Tell your doctor or nurse before treatment if you: 
- Are suffering from any condition that affects your breathing (such as asthma, wheezing, or 
shortness of breath). As Dzuveo may affect your breathing, your doctor or nurse will check your 
breathing during treatment; 
- Have a head injury or brain tumour; 
- Have problems with your heart and circulation, especially slow heart rate, irregular heartbeat, 
low blood volume or low blood pressure; 
- Have moderate to severe liver problems or severe kidney problems, as these organs have an 
effect on the way in which your body breaks down and eliminates the medicine; have 
abnormally slow bowel movements; 
- Have a disease of the gall bladder or pancreas; 
- Or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription 
medicines or illegal drugs (“addiction”); 
- Are a smoker; 
- Have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety or a personality disorder) or have 
been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses. </p>
<p>This medicine contains sufentanil which is an opioid medicine. Repeated use of opioid painkillers may </p>
<p>result in the drug being less effective (you become accustomed to it). It may also lead to dependence 
and abuse which may result in life-threatening overdose. If you have concern that you may become 
dependent on Dzuveo, it is important that you consult your doctor. </p>
<p>Consult your doctor WHILE using Dzuveo if: 
- You experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a 
higher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>What do you need to know before you take Dzuveo: 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
- Dzuveo can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses 
during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can 
include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to 
maintain sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these 
symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Dzuveo should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dzuveo 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. In particular, 
tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: 
- Ketoconazole, which is used for the treatment of fungal infections this medicine may have an 
effect on the way in which your body breaks down sufentanil. 
- Any medicines which might make you sleepy (have a sedative effect), such as sleeping pills, 
medicines to treat anxiety (e.g. benzodiazepines), tranquillisers or other opioid medicines, as they 
can increase the risk of severe breathing problems, coma and may be life-threatening. 
- Medicines for the treatment of depression known as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs). 
These medicines must not be taken in the 2 weeks before or at the same time as Dzuveo is given. 
- Medicines for the treatment of depression known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors 
(SSRIs) and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs). It is not recommended to use 
these medicines at the same time as Dzuveo. 
- Medicines to treat epilepsy, nerve pain or anxiety (gabapentin and pregabalin), as they can 
increase the risk of opioid overdose, respiratory depression and may be life-threatening. 
- Other medicines which are also taken sublingually (placed under the tongue where they dissolve) 
or medicines which take effect in your mouth (e.g. nystatin, a liquid or pastilles you hold in your 
mouth to treat fungus infections), as the effect on Dzuveo has not been studied. 
- Regularly prescribed opioid medicine (e.g. morphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, 
oxycodone). 
- Medicines used to treat high blood pressure or angina (chest pain) known as calcium channel or 
beta blockers e.g. diltiazem and nifedipine. </p>
<p>Dzuveo with alcohol 
Do not drink alcohol while using Dzuveo. It can increase the risk of experiencing severe breathing 
problems. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding

your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>

contraception. </p>

recommended while you are taking Dzuveo. </p>

<p>Dzuveo affects your ability to drive or use machines as it may cause sleepiness, dizziness or visual 
disturbances. You should not drive or operate machinery if you experience any of these symptoms 
whilst or after being treated with sufentanil. You should only drive and use machines if sufficient time 
has elapsed after your last dose of Dzuveo. </p>

‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
