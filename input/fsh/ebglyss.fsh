<p>Ebglyss is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg 
with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, who can be treated with 
systemic treatments (a medicine given by mouth or injection).  </p>
<p>Ebglyss may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own. </p>
<p>Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that blocks the action of another protein 
called interleukin-13. Interleukin-13 plays a major role in causing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. 
By blocking interleukin-13, Ebglyss can improve your atopic dermatitis and reduce the related itching 
and skin pain. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Ebglyss. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ebglyss. </p>

number (which is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions </p>
<p>Very rarely, this medicine can cause allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. These reactions can occur 
shortly after you take Ebglyss, but also may happen later. If you notice symptoms of an allergic 
reaction, you should stop using this medicine and contact your doctor or get medical help 
immediately. Signs of an allergic reaction include: 
* breathing problems 
* swelling of the face, mouth and tongue 
* fainting 
* dizziness 
* feeling lightheaded (because of low blood pressure) 
* hives, itching and skin rash </p>
<p>Eye problems </p>

in the eye, eye pain or changes in vision. </p>
<p>Vaccination </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor regarding your current vaccinations plan. See section “Other medicines and 
Ebglyss”. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children with atopic dermatitis below the age of 12 or adolescents 
12 to 17 years of age and weighing less than 40 kg because it has not been tested in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ebglyss 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
- if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
- if you have recently had a vaccination or plan to have one. You should not be given certain 
types of vaccines (live vaccines) while using Ebglyss. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known. It is better to avoid the use of Ebglyss 
during pregnancy unless your doctor advises you to use it. </p>
<p>It is not known whether lebrikizumab can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or are 
planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. You and your doctor should 
decide if you will breast-feed or use Ebglyss. You should not do both. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ebglyss is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How much Ebglyss is given and for how long 
Your doctor will decide how much Ebglyss you need and how long you will use it for. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is: 
* Two initial injections of 250 mg lebrikizumab each (500 mg in total) at week 0 and week 2. * One injection with 250 mg once every two weeks from week 4 up to week 16.<br />
Based on how you respond to the medicine, your doctor may decide to stop giving the medicine or 
to keep giving you one 250 mg injection every other week up to week 24. * One injection with 250 mg every four weeks from week 16 onwards (maintenance dosing). </p>
<p>Ebglyss is given as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) into the thigh or abdomen, 
except for 5 cm around the navel. If somebody else gives the injection, it can also be given into the 
upper arm. You and your doctor or nurse will decide if you can inject Ebglyss yourself. </p>
<p>It is recommended that you change the injection site with each injection. Ebglyss should not be 
injected into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars, or in an area of skin that is affected 
by atopic dermatitis or other skin lesions. For the initial 500 mg dose, administer two 250 mg 
injections consecutively in different injection sites. 
It is important not to try to inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or nurse. A 
caregiver may also give you your Ebglyss injection after proper training. In adolescents 12 years of 
age and older, it is recommended that Ebglyss is administered by or under the supervision of an adult. </p>
<p>The pre-filled syringe must not be shaken. </p>
<p>Read the “Instructions for use” for the pre-filled syringe carefully before using Ebglyss. </p>
<p>If you use more Ebglyss than you should 
If you took more Ebglyss than your doctor prescribed or you took the dose before it was scheduled, 
talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Ebglyss 
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Ebglyss, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forgot to inject Ebglyss when you usually have planned to do it, take it as soon as you 
remember. The next dose should be injected on the regular scheduled day. </p>
<p>If you stop using Ebglyss 
Do not stop using Ebglyss without speaking to your doctor first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
