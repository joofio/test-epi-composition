known as anti-dementia medicines. 
Memory loss in Alzheimer s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve 
signals important in learning and memory. Ebixa belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-
receptor antagonists. Ebixa acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the transmission of nerve 
signals and the memory. </p>
