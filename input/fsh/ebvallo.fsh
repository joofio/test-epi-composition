<p>Tabelecleucel is an allogeneic T-cell immunotherapeutic. It is called an allogeneic immunotherapeutic 
because the blood cells used to make this medicine come from human donors who are not related to 
the patient who is being treated. Ebvallo is made in a laboratory from T cells (a type of white blood 
cell) from a healthy donor who is immune to the Epstein-Barr virus. These cells have been 
individually selected to match with the patient receiving Ebvallo. Ebvallo is given as an injection into 
a vein.  </p>
<p>Ebvallo is used to treat a rare kind of cancer called Epstein-Barr virus positive post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PTLD) for adults and children 2 years of age and older. Some 
people experience this condition months or years after they have had a transplant. Patients will have 
received treatment with other medicines for this condition, such as monoclonal antibodies or 
chemotherapy, before they are given Ebvallo. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to tabelecleucel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Ebvallo if:<br />
* you have had a solid organ transplant or bone marrow transplant, so your doctor can monitor 
you for signs and symptoms of transplant rejection. 
* you are 65 years of age or older, so your doctor can monitor you for serious side effects. 
Ebvallo should be used with caution in elderly patients. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse after you are given Ebvallo if: 
* you have signs and symptoms of tumour flare reaction. Depending on the location of the tumour, 
Ebvallo can cause a side effect called tumour flare reaction. The tumour or enlarged lymph nodes 
may become suddenly painful or increase in size and could cause problems for organs next to the 
tumour. Tumour flare reaction generally occurs in the first few days after receiving Ebvallo. Your 
doctor will monitor you after the first few doses to see if your tumour or lymph node could get big 
enough to cause problems. Your doctor may give you other medicines to treat/prevent tumour 
flare reaction. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you have signs and symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), such symptoms include skin 
rash, abnormal liver enzymes in the blood, yellowing of the skin, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and 
bloody stools.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have signs and symptoms of a serious immune reaction called cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS), such as fever, chills, low blood pressure and shortness of breath. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have signs and symptoms of a serious immune reaction called immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), such as depressed level of consciousness, confusion, seizures 
and swelling of the brain. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, such as fever. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An ingredient of Ebvallo called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may cause an allergic reaction. Your 
doctor or nurse will monitor you for signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction. See section 2 
 Ebvallo contains sodium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) . </p>
<p>Ebvallo is tested for the presence of infectious microbes, but a small risk of infection remains. Your 
doctor or nurse will monitor you for signs and symptoms of infections and provide treatment as 
needed. </p>
<p>After treatment with Ebvallo, you must not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ebvallo 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Before you are given Ebvallo, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking medicines such as 
chemotherapy or corticosteroids. If you are taking chemotherapy, this medicine may affect how well 
Ebvallo works. If you are taking corticosteroids, your doctor will reduce the dose of corticosteroids. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. This is because the effects of this medicine 
in pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your 
breast-fed child. Ebvallo is not recommended during pregnancy and in women who could become 
pregnant not using contraception. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after you have started treatment with Ebvallo, 
talk to your doctor immediately. </li>
<li>Discuss the need for contraception with your doctor. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide 
whether to stop breast-feeding or whether to stop taking Ebvallo, considering the benefit of breast-
feeding the baby and the benefit of Ebvallo to the mother. </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Ebvallo has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. If you experience changes in your 
thinking or level of alertness after being treated with this medicine, do not drive or operate machines 
and tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Ebvallo contains sodium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .  </p>
<p>This medicine contains 100 mg DMSO per mL. See Section 2  Warnings and precautions . </p>         </div>"""
