patients aged 1 month to less than 18 years to treat a type of fungal infection of the blood or other 
internal organs called invasive candidiasis. The infection is caused by fungal cells (yeasts) called 
Candida. </p>
<p>ECALTA belongs to a group of medicines called echinocandins. These medicines are used to treat 
serious fungal infections. </p>
<p>ECALTA prevents normal development of fungal cell walls. In the presence of ECALTA, fungal cells 
have incomplete or defective cell walls, making them fragile or unable to grow. </p>         </div>"""

other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>

product. </p>
<p>If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, you (or your 
child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose in this medicine,

child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects 
such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. </p>

section for medical and healthcare professionals only). </p>
<p>For use in adults, the treatment starts with 200 mg on the first day (loading dose). This will be 
followed by a daily dose of 100 mg (maintenance dose). </p>
<p>For use in children and adolescents (age from 1 month to less than 18 years), the treatment starts with 
3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on the first day (loading dose). This will be followed by a daily dose 
of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) (maintenance dose). The dose that is given depends on the 
patient s weight. </p>
<p>ECALTA should be given to you once a day, by slow infusion (a drip) into your vein. For adults, this 
will take at least 1.5 hours for the maintenance dose and 3 hours for the loading dose. For children and 
adolescents, the infusion may take less time depending on the patient s weight. </p>
<p>Your doctor will determine the duration of your treatment and how much ECALTA you will receive 
each day and will monitor your response and condition. </p>
<p>In general, your treatment should continue for at least 14 days after the last day Candida was found in 
your blood. </p>

<p>If you are concerned that you may have been given too much ECALTA, tell your doctor or another 
healthcare professional immediately. </p>

missed. However tell your doctor or pharmacist if you think that a dose has been forgotten. </p>

<p>If you stop using ECALTA </p>
