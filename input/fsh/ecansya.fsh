absorbed by the body is it changed into an active anti-cancer medicine (more in tumour tissue than in 
normal tissue).
Ecansya is used in the treatment of colon, rectal, gastric, or breast cancers.
Furthermore, Ecansya is used to prevent new occurrence of colon cancer after complete removal of the 
tumour by surgery.
Ecansya may be used either alone or in combination with other medicines.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to capecitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). You must inform your doctor if you know that you have an allergy or over-reaction 
to this medicine,
-
if you previously have had severe reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy (a group of anticancer
medicines, such as fluorouracil),
-
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding,
-
if you have severely low levels of white cells or platelets in the blood (leucopenia, neutropenia 
or thrombocytopenia),
-
if you have severe liver or kidney problems,
-
if you know that you do not have any activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase 
(DPD) (complete DPD deficiency),
-
if you are being treated now or have been treated in the last 4 weeks with brivudine as part of 
herpes zoster (chickenpox or shingles) therapy.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ecansya
-
if you know that you have a partial  deficiency in the activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine 
dehydrogenase (DPD)
-
if you have a family member who has partial or complete deficiency of the enzyme 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)<br />
-
if you have liver or kidney diseases
-
if you have or had heart problems (for example an irregular heartbeat or pains to the chest, jaw 
and back, brought on by physical effort and due to problems with the blood flow to the heart)
-
if you have brain diseases (for example, cancer that has spread to the brain) or nerve damage 
(neuropathy)
-
if you have calcium imbalances (seen in blood tests)
-
if you have diabetes
-
if you cannot keep food or water in your body because of severe nausea and vomiting
-
if you have diarrhoea
-
if you are or become dehydrated
-
if you have imbalances of ions in your blood (electrolyte imbalances, seen in tests)
-
if you have a history of eye problems as you may need extra monitoring of your eyes
-
if you have a severe skin reaction.
DPD deficiency: DPD deficiency is a genetic condition that is not usually associated with health 
problems unless you receive certain medicines. If you have DPD deficiency and take Ecansya, you are 
at an increased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 Possible side effects). It is 
recommended to test you for DPD deficiency before start of treatment. If you have no activity of the 
enzyme you should not take Ecansya. If you have a reduced enzyme activity (partial deficiency) your 
doctor might prescribe a reduced dose. If you have negative test results for DPD deficiency, severe 
and life-threatening side effects may still occur.
Children and adolescents
Ecansya is not indicated in children and adolescents. Do not give Ecansya to children and adolescents.
Other medicines and Ecansya
Before starting treatment, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might 
take any other medicines. This is extremely important, as taking more than one medicine at the same 
time can strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines.
You must not take brivudine (an anti-viral medicine for the treatment of shingles or chickenpox) 
at the same time as capecitabine treatment (including during any rest periods when you are not 
taking any capecitabine tablets).
If you have taken brivudine you must wait for at least 4 weeks after stopping brivudine before 
starting to take capecitabine. See also section "Do not take Ecansya".
Also, you need to be particularly careful if you are taking any of the following:
-
gout medicines (allopurinol),
-
blood-thinning medicines (coumarin, warfarin),
-
medicines for seizures or tremors (phenytoin),
-
interferon alpha,
-
radiotherapy and certain medicines used to treat cancer (folinic acid, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, 
cisplatin, irinotecan),
-
medicines used to treat folic acid deficiency.
Ecansya with food and drink
You should take Ecansya no later than 30 minutes after meals.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You must not take Ecansya if you 
are pregnant or think you might be. 
You must not breast-feed if you are taking Ecansya and for 2 weeks after the last dose.
If you are a woman who could become pregnant you should use effective contraception during 
treatment with Ecansya and for 6 months after the last dose.
If you are a male patient and your female partner could become pregnant, you should use effective 
contraception during treatment with Ecansya and for 3 months after the last dose.
Driving and using machines
Ecansya may make you feel dizzy, nauseous or tired. It is therefore possible that Ecansya could affect 
your ability to drive a car or operate machines.
Ecansya contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.</p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Capecitabine should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines.
Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The dose of Ecansya is 
based on your body surface area. This is calculated from your height and weight. The usual dose for 
adults is 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning and evening). Two 
examples are provided here: A person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 1.64 m has a body 
surface area of 1.7 m2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg two times daily. A 
person whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 2.00 m2 and should 
take 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily.
Your doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need 
to take it.
Your doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose.
-
Take the tablets morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor.
-
Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) and swallow 
whole with water. Do not crush or cut tablets. If you cannot swallow Ecansya tablets 
whole, tell your healthcare provider.
-
It is important that you take all your medicine as prescribed by your doctor.
Ecansya tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no tablets are 
taken). This 21 day period is one treatment cycle.
In combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1250 mg/m2 of body 
surface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no 
rest period).
If you take more Ecansya than you should
If you take more Ecansya than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible before taking the 
next dose.
You might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should: feeling 
or being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the 
intestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). Tell your
doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.
If you forget to take Ecansya
Do not take the missed dose at all. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, 
continue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor.
If you stop taking Ecansya
There are no side-effects caused by stopping treatment with capecitabine. In case you are using 
coumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping capecitabine might require that 
your doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
STOP taking Ecansya immediately and contact your doctor if any of these symptoms occur:
-
Diarrhoea: if you have an increase of 4 or more bowel movements compared to your normal 
bowel movements each day or any diarrhoea at night.
-
Vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period.
-
Nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less than 
usual.
-
Stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat.
-
Hand-and-foot skin-reaction: if you have pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or 
feet.
-
Fever: if you have a temperature of 38 C or greater.
-
Infection: if you experience signs of infection caused by bacteria or virus, or other organisms.
-
Chest pain: if you experience pain localised to the centre of the chest, especially if it occurs 
during exercise.
-
Steven-Johnson syndrome: if you experience painful red or purplish rash that spreads and 
blisters and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g. mouth and lips), in 
particular if you had before light sensitivity, infections of the respiratory system (e.g. bronchitis) 
and/or fever.
-
DPD deficiency: if you have a known DPD deficiency, you are at an increased risk of acute 
early-onset of toxicity and severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions caused by Ecansya 
(e.g. stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity).
-
Angioedema: Seek medical attention straight away if you notice any of the following symptoms 
  you may need urgent medical treatment: swelling mainly of the face, lips, tongue or throat 
which makes it difficult to swallow or breathe, itching and rashes. This could be a sign of 
angioedema. 
If caught early, these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after treatment discontinuation. If
these side effects continue, however, contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor may instruct you
to restart treatment at a lower dose.
If severe stomatitis (sores in your mouth and/or throat), mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia 
(increased risk for infections), or neurotoxicity occurs during the first cycle of treatment a DPD 
deficiency may be involved (please see Section 2: Warning and precautions).
Hand and foot skin reaction can lead to loss of fingerprint, which could impact your identification by 
fingerprint scan.

more than 1 in 10 people are:
-
abdominal pain
-
rash, dry or itchy skin
-
tiredness
-
loss of appetite (anorexia)
These side effects can become severe; therefore, it is important that you always contact your doctor 
immediately when you start to experience a side effect. Your doctor may instruct you to decrease the 
dose and/or temporarily discontinue treatment with Ecansya. This will help reduce the likelihood that 
the side effect continues or becomes severe.
