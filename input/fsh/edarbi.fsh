called angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs). Angiotensin II is a substance which occurs 
naturally in the body and which causes the blood vessels to tighten, therefore increasing your blood 
pressure. Edarbi blocks this effect so that the blood vessels relax, which helps lower your blood 
pressure. </p>
<p>This medicine is used for treating high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adult patients (over 
18 years of age). </p>
<p>A reduction in your blood pressure will be measureable within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment and 
the full effect of your dose will be observed by 4 weeks. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). 
- are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid this medicine in early 
pregnancy - see pregnancy section).

medicine containing aliskiren. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Edarbi, especially if you 
- have kidney problems. 
- are on dialysis or had a recent kidney transplant. 
- have severe liver disease. 
- have heart problems (including heart failure, recent heart attack). 
- have ever had a stroke.

valve stenosis ) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
 obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ). 
- are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: * an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. * aliskiren. </p>
<p>Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading  Do not take Edarbi . 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Edarbi is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must NOT be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as 
it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see section "Pregnancy section and breast-
feeding"). Edarbi may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is limited data on the use of Edarbi in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. Therefore, 
this medicine should not be given to children or adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Edarbi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Edarbi can affect the way some other medicines work and some medicines can have an effect on 
Edarbi. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lithium (a medicine for mental health problems) </li>
<li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac or celecoxib 
(medicines to relieve pain and inflammation) </li>
<li>Acetylsalicyclic acid if taking more than 3 g per day (medicine to relieve pain and 
inflammation) </li>
<li>Medicines that increase the amount of potassium in your blood; these include potassium 
supplements, potassium-sparing medicines (certain  water tablets ) or salt substitutes containing 
potassium </li>
<li>Heparin (a medicine for thinning the blood) </li>
<li>Diuretics (water tablets) </li>
<li>Aliskiren or other medicines to lower your blood pressure (angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril or valsartan, 
telmisartan, irbesartan). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions if you are taking an 
ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take Edarbi  and 
 Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking this medicine before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Edarbi. 
Edarbi is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must NOT be taken when more than 3 months 
pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Edarbi is not recommended for mothers who are breast-
feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if 
your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Edarbi is unlikely to have an effect on driving or using machines. However some people may feel tired 
or dizzy when taking this medicine and if this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or 
machines. </p>
<p>Edarbi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
