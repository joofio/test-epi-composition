  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Edistride is
Edistride contains the active substance dapagliflozin. It belongs to a group of medicines called
 sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors . They work by blocking the SGLT2 protein in 
your kidney. By blocking this protein, blood sugar (glucose), salt (sodium) and water are removed 
from your body via the urine.
What Edistride is used for
Edistride is used to treat:</p>
<h2>Type 2 diabetes</h2>
<h2>in adults and children aged 10 years and older.</h2>
<h2>if your type 2 diabetes cannot be controlled with diet and exercise.</h2>
<h2>Edistride can be used on its own or together with other medicines to treat diabetes.</h2>
<p>It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>
<h2>Heart failure</h2>
<p>in adults (aged 18 years and older) when the heart does not pump blood as well as it 
should.</p>
<h2>Chronic kidney disease</h2>
<p>in adults with reduced kidney function.
What is type 2 diabetes and how does Edistride help?</p>
<p>In type 2 diabetes your body does not make enough insulin or is not able to use the insulin it 
makes properly. This leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. This can lead to serious 
problems like heart or kidney disease, blindness, and poor circulation in your arms and legs.</p>
<p>Edistride works by removing excess sugar from your body. It can also help prevent heart 
disease.
What is heart failure and how does Edistride help?</p>
<p>This type of heart failure occurs when the heart does not pump blood to the lungs and the rest of 
the body as well as it should. This can lead to serious medical problems and need for hospital 
care.</p>
<p>The most common symptoms of heart failure are feeling breathless, feeling tired or very tired all 
the time, and ankle swelling.</p>
<p>Edistride helps protect your heart from getting worse and improves your symptoms. It can lower 
the need to go to hospital and can help some patients to live longer.
What is chronic kidney disease and how does Edistride help?</p>
<p>When you have chronic kidney disease, your kidneys may gradually lose their function. This 
means they would not be able to clean and filter your blood the way they should. Loss of kidney 
function can lead to serious medical problems and need for hospital care. </p>
<p>Edistride helps protect your kidneys from losing their function. That can help some patients to 
live longer.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away
Diabetic ketoacidosis:</p>
<p>If you have diabetes and experience feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat or rapid 
weight loss.</p>
<p>The above symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic ketoacidosis    a rare but serious, sometimes 
life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of  ketone 
bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests.</p>
<p>The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive 
alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin 
due to major surgery or serious illness.</p>
<p>When you are treated with Edistride, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur even if your blood sugar is 
normal.
If you suspect you have diabetic ketoacidosis, contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away 
and do not take this medicine. 
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum:</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or 
feeling generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even 
life-threatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene 
which destroys the tissue under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Edistride</p>
<p>if you have  type 1 diabetes    the type that usually starts when you are young, and your body 
does not produce any insulin. Edistride should not be used to treat this condition.</p>
<p>if you have diabetes and have a kidney problem   your doctor may ask you to take additional or 
a different medicine to control your blood sugar.</p>
<p>if you have a liver problem   your doctor may start you on a lower dose.</p>
<p>if you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history of 
low blood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below under  Other medicines and 
Edistride .</p>
<p>if you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too 
much body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed in section 4. Tell your doctor before 
you start taking Edistride if you have any of these signs.</p>
<p>if you have or develop nausea (feeling sick), vomiting or fever or if you are not able to eat or 
drink. These conditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking 
Edistride until you recover to prevent dehydration.</p>
<p>if you often get infections of the urinary tract. This medicine may cause urinary tract infections 
and your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. Your doctor may consider temporarily 
changing your treatment if you develop a serious infection.
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking Edistride.
Diabetes and foot care
If you have diabetes, it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional.
Urine glucose
Because of how Edistride works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this medicine.
Elderly (  65 years and above)
If you are elderly, there may be a higher risk that your kidneys function less well and that you are 
treated with other medicines (see also  Kidney function  above and  Other medicines and Edistride<br />
below).
Children and adolescents
Edistride can be used in children aged 10 years and older for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. No data 
are available in children below 10 years of age.
Edistride is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age for the treatment of 
heart failure or for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, because it has not been studied in these 
patients.
Other medicines and Edistride
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Especially tell your doctor:</p>
<p>if you are taking a medicine used to remove water from the body (diuretic).</p>
<p>if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or 
a  sulphonylurea  medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, 
to prevent you from getting low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia).</p>
<p>if you are taking lithium because Edistride can lower the amount of lithium in your blood.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should stop taking this medicine 
if you become pregnant, since it is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant.
Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. Do not use 
Edistride if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if this medicine passes into human breast milk.
Driving and using machines
Edistride has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Taking this medicine with other medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause too low 
blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and 
change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Do not drive or use any tools or machines, if you feel dizzy taking Edistride.
Edistride contains lactose
Edistride contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.</p>         </div>"""

This will help you to remember to take it.
Your doctor may prescribe Edistride together with other medicine(s). Remember to take these other 
medicine(s) as your doctor has told you. This will help get the best results for your health.
Diet and exercise can help your body use its blood sugar better. If you have diabetes, it is important to 
stay on any diet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking Edistride.
If you take more Edistride than you should
If you take more Edistride tablets than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital immediately. 
Take the medicine pack with you.
If you forget to take Edistride
What to do if you forget to take a tablet depends on how long it is until your next dose.</p>
<p>If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose, take a dose of Edistride as soon as you remember. 
Then take your next dose at the usual time.</p>
<p>If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at 
the usual time.</p>
<p>Do not take a double dose of Edistride to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Edistride
Do not stop taking Edistride without talking to your doctor first. If you have diabetes, your blood 
sugar may increase without this medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
