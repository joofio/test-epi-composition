Do not take EDURANT in combination with any of the following medicines as they may affect the 
way EDURANT or the other medicine works:
-
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures)
-
rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)
-
omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, (proton pump inhibitors 
that are medicines to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux disease)
-
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions) when taken by mouth or injected, except as a single dose treatment
-
products that contain St John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for 
depression).
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking EDURANT.
EDURANT is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in the 
blood. 
EDURANT has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to 
this age group, please discuss the use of EDURANT with your doctor.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.
-
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including 
hepatitis B and/or C, and/or problems with your kidneys. Your doctor may evaluate how 
severe your liver or kidney disease is before deciding if you can take EDURANT.
-
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections (for example, fever, 
chills, sweats). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic
infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after 
HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the 
body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with 
no obvious symptoms.
-
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.
-
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that may cause a life-threatening irregular 
heartbeat (Torsade de Pointes).
Children
EDURANT is not for use in children less than 12 years of age, because it has not been sufficiently 
studied in these patients.
Other medicines and EDURANT
You must take EDURANT together with other HIV medicines. Your doctor will advise on which HIV 
medicines can be combined with EDURANT and together you will decide which combination fits 
your needs best. Follow your doctor s instruction carefully.
Some medicines may affect the levels of EDURANT in the blood when they are taken at the same 
time as EDURANT.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
It is not recommended to combine EDURANT with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTIs) such as delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine.
The effects of EDURANT or other medicines might be influenced if you take EDURANT together 
with any of the following medicines. Tell your doctor if you take:
-
rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections). If you take this medicine while taking 
EDURANT, please carefully read how to take EDURANT in section 3  Instructions for proper 
use in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) .
-
clarithromycin, erythromycin (antibiotics)
-
cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine (H2-receptor antagonists used to treat stomach or 
intestinal ulcers or used to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux). If you take these medicines, 
please carefully read how to take them in section 3  Instructions for proper use in adults and 
adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) .
-
antacids (used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach; for example, 
aluminium/magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate). If you take these medicines, please 
carefully read how to take them in section 3  Instructions for proper use in adults and 
adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) .
-
methadone (used to treat narcotic withdrawal and dependence)
-
dabigatran etexilate (anticoagulant).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. Pregnant women 
should discuss the use of EDURANT with their doctor.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Some patients may experience tiredness, dizziness or drowsiness during treatment with EDURANT. 
Do not drive or operate machinery if you feel tired, dizzy or drowsy while taking EDURANT.
EDURANT contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.
EDURANT contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

Instructions for proper use in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age)
The recommended dose of EDURANT is one tablet once a day.
EDURANT must be taken with a meal. A meal is important to get the right levels of active 
substance in your body. A nutritional drink (e.g. protein-rich) alone does not replace a meal.
There are four situations that require special attention:
1. If you take rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections), take two tablets of 
EDURANT once a day. When you stop taking rifabutin, take one tablet of EDURANT once a 
day. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
2. If you take an antacid (a medicine to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach such as 
aluminium / magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate). Take the antacid either at least 2 hours 
before or at least 4 hours after EDURANT (see section 2  Other medicines and EDURANT ).
3. If you take an H2-receptor antagonist (medicines used to treat stomach or intestinal ulcers or 
used to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux (such as cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine or 
ranitidine). Take the H2-receptor antagonist at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after 
EDURANT (see section 2  Other medicines and EDURANT ). H2-receptor antagonists should 
not be taken in a twice a day regimen. Talk to your doctor about an alternative regimen.
4. If you take didanosine (a medicine to treat HIV infection), no dose adjustment is required. 
Didanosine should be administered on an empty stomach at least two hours before or at least 
four hours after EDURANT (which must be taken with a meal).
Removing the child resistant cap
The bottle comes with a child resistant cap. It can be opened by pushing the screw 
cap down while turning it anti-clockwise.
If you take more EDURANT than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. In case of overdose, you may have a headache, 
nausea, dizziness, and/or abnormal dreams.
If you forget to take EDURANT
If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take EDURANT, you must take the tablet as 
soon as possible. The EDURANT tablet must be taken with a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. 
If you notice after 12 hours, then skip that dose and take the next doses as usual.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you vomit less than 4 hours after taking EDURANT, take another tablet with a meal. If you vomit 
more than 4 hours after taking EDURANT you do not need to take another tablet until your next 
regularly scheduled tablet.
Contact your doctor if uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.
Do not stop using EDURANT
HIV treatment does not cure HIV infection! Do not stop using EDURANT without talking to your 
doctor first. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking EDURANT or your other HIV medicines. 
Doing so could increase the risk of the virus developing resistance. Talk to your doctor first.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
