<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are taking other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir 
disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be taken with any of 
these medicines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have or have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your 
kidneys. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not recommended if 
you have moderate to severe kidney disease. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may affect your kidneys. Before 
starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess kidney function. Your 
doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor your kidneys. </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not usually taken with other 
medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other medicines and 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan). If this is unavoidable, your 
doctor will monitor your kidney function once a week. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called 
prolongation of the QT interval. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or 
alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal 
thoughts or have strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you 
are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of 
anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. Your doctor may give you a 
different anticonvulsant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a history of liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis. Patients 
with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with 
combination antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially life-
threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check 
how well your liver is working or may switch you to another medicine. If you have 
severe liver disease, do not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan (see earlier in section 2, Do not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have hepatitis B infection, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment 
regimen for you. Tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine, two of the active substances 
in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, show some activity against 
hepatitis B virus although emtricitabine is not approved for the treatment of hepatitis 
B infection. Symptoms of your hepatitis may become worse after discontinuation of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. Your doctor may then conduct 
blood tests at regular intervals in order to check how well your liver is working (see 
section 3, If you stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan).  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Independent of a history of liver disease, your doctor will consider regular blood tests 
to check how your liver is working. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are over 65. Insufficient numbers of patients over 65 years of age have been 
studied. If you are over 65 years of age and are prescribed 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, your doctor will monitor you 
carefully. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you start taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, look out for:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or 
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment 
and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any signs of skin rash. Rashes may be caused by Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan and tell your doctor at 
once. If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at higher risk of 
getting a rash with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV 
infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of 
inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to improvement in the body s 
immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present 
with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your 
doctor at once. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that 
occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you 
start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders 
may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of 
infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the 
hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or 
hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<ul>
<li>bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop 
a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid 
use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, 
among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs 
of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and 
shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms, please 
inform your doctor.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes 
resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see 
section 4, Possible side effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone 
loss was seen in clinical studies when patients were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 
in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor. </p>
<p>Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long-term bone health and future 
fracture risk in adult and paediatric patients are uncertain. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis 
are at a higher risk for fractures. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not give Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to children and 
adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan in children and adolescents has not been studied. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan </p>
<p>You must not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with certain medicines. 
These are listed under Do not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, at the start of 
section 2. They include some common medicines and some herbal preparations (including St. John s 
wort) which can cause serious interactions. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Also, Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be taken with any other 
medicines that contain efavirenz (unless recommended by your doctor), emtricitabine, tenofovir 
disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines which may damage your kidneys. Some examples 
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>aminoglycosides, vancomycin (medicines for bacterial infections) </li>
<li>foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (medicines for viral infections) </li>
<li>amphotericin B, pentamidine (medicines for fungal infections) </li>
<li>interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) </li>
<li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) </li>
</ul>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may interact with other medicines, including 
herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba extracts. As a result, the amounts of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan or other medicines in your blood may be 
affected. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. 
In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important 
to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with other antiviral medicines that 
contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell 
counts. Inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), 
which sometimes caused death, have been reported rarely when medicines containing 
tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your doctor will carefully consider 
whether to treat you with medicines containing tenofovir and didanosine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other medicines used for HIV infection: The following protease inhibitors: darunavir, 
indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, or ritonavir boosted atazanavir or saquinavir. Your 
doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease 
inhibitors. Also, tell your doctor if you are taking maraviroc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): Atorvastatin, pravastatin, 
simvastatin. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can reduce the amount of 
statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider 
changing the dose of your statin, if needed.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): Carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can reduce the amount of 
the anticonvulsant in your blood. Carbamazepine can reduce the amount of efavirenz, one of 
the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, in your blood. Your 
doctor may need to consider giving you a different anticonvulsant.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related 
mycobacterium avium complex: Clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may need 
to consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor 
may consider giving you an additional dose of efavirenz to treat your HIV infection.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): Itraconazole or posaconazole. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can reduce the amount of itraconazole or 
posaconazole in your blood. Your doctor may need to consider giving you a different 
antifungal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat malaria: Atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may reduce the amount of 
atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine in your blood.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praziquantel, a medicine used to treat parasitic worm infections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for 
example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): You must 
also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding). 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may make hormonal contraceptives less 
likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in women taking efavirenz, a component of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, while using a contraceptive implant, 
although it has not been established that the efavirenz therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sertraline, a medicine used to treat depression, as your doctor may need to change your dose 
of sertraline.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metamizole, a medicine used to treat pain and fever. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bupropion, a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking, as your doctor 
may need to change your dose of bupropion. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers): When you start taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, your doctor may need to adjust your 
dose of the calcium channel blocker. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection (also called immunosuppressants), 
such as cyclosporine, sirolimus or tacrolimus. When you start or stop taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan your doctor will closely monitor your 
plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): Your doctor 
may need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test 
to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan. </p>
<p>If you could get pregnant while receiving Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, 
you need to use a reliable form of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods 
of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, 
injection). Efavirenz, one of the active components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan, may remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue 
to use contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are 
pregnant, you should take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan only if you and your 
doctor decide it is clearly needed.  </p>
<p>Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with 
efavirenz during pregnancy.  </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>If you have taken Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan during your pregnancy, your 
doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your 
child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against 
HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan.<br />
The ingredients of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may pass through breast milk 
and cause serious harm to your baby. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may cause dizziness, impaired 
concentration and drowsiness. If you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains sodium and lactose 
This medicine contains 7.5 mg of sodium metabisulfite per tablet, which may rarely cause severe 
hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. It contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, 
that is to say essentially  sodium-free . Each tablet also contains 105.5 mg of lactose per tablet. If you 
have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before 
taking this medicine.  </p>         </div>"""

not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan </p>
<p>Don t stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan without talking to your 
doctor. Stopping Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can seriously affect your 
response to future treatment. If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is stopped, speak 
to your doctor before you restart taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan tablets. 
Your doctor may consider giving you the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan separately if you are having problems or need your dose adjusted. </p>
<p>When your supply of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan starts to run low, get 
more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is very important because the amount of virus may start to 
increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. </p>
<p>If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan treatment without talking to your doctor first. 
Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after 
stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three components of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan). If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis B treatment. You may require 
blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. In some patients 
with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to 
worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly 
symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
