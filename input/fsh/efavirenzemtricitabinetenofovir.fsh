<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor: </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>if you are taking other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir 
disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide or lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be taken with any of 
these medicines. </p>
<p>if you have or have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your 
kidneys. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not recommended if you 
have moderate to severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may affect your kidneys. Before 
starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess kidney function. Your 
doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor your kidneys. </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is not usually taken with other 
medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other medicines and 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva). If this is unavoidable, your doctor 
will monitor your kidney function once a week. </p>
<p>if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation 
of the QT interval. </p>
<p>if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol 
abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have 
strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). </p>
<p>if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are 
taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant 
medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. Your doctor may give you a 
different anticonvulsant. </p>
<p>if you have a history of liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis. Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with combination 
antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. 
Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or 
may switch you to another medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva (see earlier in section 2, Do not 
take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva). </p>
<p>If you have hepatitis B infection, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment 
regimen for you. Tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine, two of the active substances in 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, show some activity against hepatitis 
B virus although emtricitabine is not approved for the treatment of hepatitis B infection. 
Symptoms of your hepatitis may become worse after discontinuation of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. Your doctor may then conduct 
blood tests at regular intervals in order to check how well your liver is working (see 
section 3, If you stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva). </p>
<p>Independent of a history of liver disease, your doctor will consider regular blood tests to 
check how your liver is working. </p>
<p>if you are over 65. Insufficient numbers of patients over 65 years of age have been 
studied. If you are over 65 years of age and are prescribed 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, your doctor will monitor you 
carefully. </p>
<ul>
<li>Once you start taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, look out for: </li>
</ul>
<p>signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or 
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and 
usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. </p>
<p>any signs of skin rash. Rashes may be caused by Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva and tell your doctor at once. 
If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at higher risk of getting a rash 
with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. </p>
<p>any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation 
from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed 
that these symptoms are due to improvement in the body s immune response, enabling the 
body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor at once. </p>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs 
when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start 
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may 
occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or 
other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and 
moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please 
inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a 
bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to 
the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be 
some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint 
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes 
resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, 
Possible side effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. Overall, the effects of tenofovir 
disoproxil on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in adult and paediatric 
patients are uncertain. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis are 
at a higher risk for fractures. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
* Do not give Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva to children and 
adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva in children and adolescents has not been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva </p>
<p>You must not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with certain medicines. 
These are listed under Do not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, at the start of 
section 2. They include some common medicines and some herbal preparations (including St. John s 
wort) which can cause serious interactions. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Also, Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should not be taken with any other 
medicines that contain efavirenz (unless recommended by your doctor), emtricitabine, tenofovir 
disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines which may damage your kidneys. Some examples 
include: 
* aminoglycosides, vancomycin (medicines for bacterial infections) 
* foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (medicines for viral infections) 
* amphotericin B, pentamidine (medicines for fungal infections) 
* interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) 
* non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may interact with other medicines, including 
herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba extracts. As a result, the amounts of </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva or other medicines in your blood may be 
affected. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. 
In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important 
to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva with other antiviral medicines that contain 
didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts. 
Inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which 
sometimes caused death, have been reported rarely when medicines containing tenofovir 
disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your doctor will carefully consider whether to 
treat you with medicines containing tenofovir and didanosine. </li>
<li>Other medicines used for HIV infection: The following protease inhibitors: darunavir, 
indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, or ritonavir boosted atazanavir or saquinavir. Your 
doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease 
inhibitors. Also, tell your doctor if you are taking maraviroc. </li>
<li>Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. </li>
<li>Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): Atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can reduce the amount of statins in your 
blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of 
your statin, if needed. </li>
<li>Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): Carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can reduce the amount of 
the anticonvulsant in your blood. 
Carbamazepine can reduce the amount of efavirenz, one of the components of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, in your blood. Your doctor may need to 
consider giving you a different anticonvulsant. </li>
<li>Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related 
mycobacterium avium complex: Clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may need to 
consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor 
may consider giving you an additional dose of efavirenz to treat your HIV infection. </li>
<li>Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): Itraconazole or posaconazole. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can reduce the amount of itraconazole or 
posaconazole in your blood. Your doctor may need to consider giving you a different antifungal. </li>
<li>Medicines used to treat malaria: Atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may reduce the amount of 
atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine in your blood. </li>
<li>Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for 
example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): You must 
also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding). 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may make hormonal contraceptives less 
likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in women taking efavirenz, a component of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, while using a contraceptive implant, 
although it has not been established that the efavirenz therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. </li>
<li>Sertraline, a medicine used to treat depression, as your doctor may need to change your dose of 
sertraline. </li>
<li>Bupropion, a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking, as your doctor may 
need to change your dose of bupropion. </li>
<li>Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers): When you start taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, your doctor may need to adjust your dose 
of the calcium channel blocker. </li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection (also called immunosuppressants), 
such as cyclosporine, sirolimus or tacrolimus. When you start or stop taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva your doctor will closely monitor your 
plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): Your doctor may 
need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. </p>
</li>
<li>Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation). </li>
<li>Metamizole, a medicine used to treat pain and fever. </li>
<li>Praziquantel, a medicine used to treat certain parasitic infections. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy 
test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva. </p>
<p>If you could get pregnant while receiving Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, 
you need to use a reliable form of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of 
contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). 
Efavirenz, one of the active components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva, may 
remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use 
contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are 
pregnant, you should take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva only if you and your 
doctor decide it is clearly needed. </p>
<p>Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with 
efavirenz during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>If you have taken Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva during your pregnancy, your 
doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your 
child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against 
HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. 
Both HIV and the ingredients of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may pass 
through breast milk and cause serious harm to your baby. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on 
to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva may cause dizziness, impaired 
concentration and drowsiness. If you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose is: 
One tablet taken each day by mouth. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva should be 
taken on an empty stomach (commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) preferably at

Zentiva, you may be given efavirenz, emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil separately or with other 
medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. </p>
<p>Removing the child resistant cap 
Open bottles by pressing the child resistant cap down and turning it counter-clock wise. </p>
<p>If you take more Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva than you should 
If you accidentally take too many Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva tablets you 
may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, 
Possible side effects). Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the 
tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
It is important not to miss a dose of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. </p>
<p>If you do miss a dose of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva within 12 hours of 
when it is usually taken, take it as soon as you can, and then take your next dose at its regular time. </p>
<p>If it is almost time (less than 12 hours) for your next dose anyway, do not take the missed dose. 
Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
tablet. </p>
<p>If you throw up the tablet (within 1 hour after taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Zentiva), you should take another tablet. Do not wait until your next dose is due. You do 
not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva 
Don t stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva without talking to your 
doctor. Stopping Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva can seriously affect your 
response to future treatment. If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is stopped, speak 
to your doctor before you restart taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva tablets. 
Your doctor may consider giving you the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Zentiva separately if you are having problems or need your dose adjusted. </p>
<p>When your supply of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva starts to run low, get 
more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is very important because the amount of virus may start to 
increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. </p>
<p>If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva treatment without talking to your doctor first. 
Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after 
stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three components of </p>

lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. </p>

symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
