* If you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, 
morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least a week, to control 
your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not use Effentora, 
because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow and/or shallow, or 
even stop. 
* If you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* If you suffer from severe breathing problems or severe obstructive lung conditions. 
* If you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain 
* If you are taking a medicine which contains sodium oxybate.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Keep using the opioid pain medicine you take for your persistent (around-the-clock) cancer pain 
during your Effentora treatment. 
Whilst you are being treated with Effentora, do not use other fentanyl treatments previously prescribed 
for your breakthrough pain. If you still have some of these fentanyl treatments at home, contact your 
pharmacist to check how to dispose of them. 
Repeated use of the product may result in the drug being less effective (you become accustomed to it) 
or becoming dependent on it. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist BEFORE using Effentora if: 
* Your other opioid pain medicine taken for your persistent (around-the-clock) cancer pain is not 
stabilised yet. 
* You are suffering from any condition that has an effect on your breathing (such as asthma, 
wheezing, or shortness of breath). 
* You have a head injury. 
* You have an exceptionally slow heart rate or other heart problems. 
* You have liver or kidney problems, as these organs have an effect on the way in which your 
system breaks down the medicine. 
* You have low amount of fluid in the circulation or low blood pressure. 
* You are over 65 years old - you may need a lower dose and any dose increase will be reviewed 
very carefully by your doctor. 
* You have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate. 
* You use benzodiazepines (see section 2 under  Other medicines and Effentora ). Using 
benzodiazepines can increase the chances of getting serious side effects including death 
* You use antidepressants or antipsychotics (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], 
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors; see 
section 2 under  Do not use Effentora  and  Other medicines and Effentora )The use of these 
medicines with Effentora can lead to a serotonin syndrome a potentially life-threatening 
condition (see section 2 under  Other medicines and Effentora ). 
* You have ever developed adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the adrenal glands do not 
produce enough hormones or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) with opioid use (see 
section 4 under  Serious side effects ). 
* You have ever abused or been dependent on opioids or any other drug, alcohol or illegal drugs. 
* You drink alcohol; please refer to section Effentora with food, drink and alcohol. </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to check you more closely if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription 
medicines or illegal drugs ( addiction ). </li>
<li>You are a smoker. </li>
<li>You have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety or a personality disorder) or have 
been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses. </li>
</ul>
<p>Consult your doctor WHILE using Effentora if: 
* You experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a 
higher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. 
* You experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, 
weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a 
potentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the adrenal 
glands do not produce enough hormones. 
* Sleep-related breathing disorders: Effentora can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as 
sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the 
blood). The symptoms can include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to 
shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or 
another person observe these symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered 
by your doctor. 
* Repeated use of Effentora may lead to dependence and abuse which may result in life-threatening 
overdose. If you have concern that you may become dependent on Effentora, it is important that 
you consult your doctor. </p>
<p>Seek URGENT medical advice if: 
* You experience symptoms such as difficulty in breathing or dizziness, swelling of the tongue, lip 
or throat while using Effentora. These might be early symptoms of a serious allergic reaction 
(anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity; see section 4 under  Serious side effects ) </p>
<p>What to do if someone accidentally takes Effentora 
If you think someone has accidentally taken Effentora please seek immediate medical assistance. Try 
to keep the person awake until emergency help arrives. </p>
<p>If someone has accidentally taken Effentora, they may have the same side effects as described in the 
section 3  If you use more Effentora than you should . </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Effentora 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist before starting Effentora if you are taking or have recently taken or 
might take any of the following medicines: 
* Concomitant use of Effentora and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), coma and may 
be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be considered when other 
treatment options are not possible.  </p>
<p>However if your doctor does prescribe Effentora together with sedative medicines the dose and 
duration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking (such as sleeping pills, 
medicines to treat anxiety, some medicines to treat allergic reactions (antihistamines), or 
tranquillisers) and follow your doctor s dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to 
inform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your 
doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
* Some muscle relaxants - such as baclofen, diazepam (see also section  Warnings and 
precautions . 
* Any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Effentora, 
such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and fosamprenavir (medicines that help control HIV 
infection) or other so-called CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole 
(used for treatment of fungal infections), troleandomycine, clarithromycine, or erythromycine 
(medicines for treatment of bacterial infections), aprepitant (used for severe nausea) and diltiazem 
and verapamil (medicines for treatment of high blood pressure or heart diseases). 
* Medicines called monoamine-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used for severe depression) or have done 
so in the past 2 weeks. 
* Certain type of strong pain killers, called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, 
nalbuphine and pentazocine (medicines for treatment of pain). You could experience symptoms of 
withdrawal syndrom (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating) while 
using these medicines. 
* Some painkillers for nerve pain (gabapentin and pregabalin). 
* The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or 
antipsychotics. Effentora may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental status 
changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature above 
38 C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, muscular rigidity, 
lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). Your 
doctor will tell you whether Effentora is suitable for you. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Effentora with food, drink and alcohol 
* Effentora may be used before or after, but not during, meals. You may drink some water before 
using Effentora to help moisten your mouth, but you should not drink or eat anything while taking 
the medicine.<br />
* You should not drink grapefruit juice while using Effentora because it may affect the way your 
body breaks down Effentora. 
* Do not drink alcohol while using Effentora. It can increase the risk of experiencing serious side 
effects including death. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Effentora should not be used during pregnancy unless you have discussed this with your doctor. 
If Effentora is used for a long time during pregnancy, there is also a risk of the new-born child having 
withdrawal symptoms which might be life-threatening if not recognized and treated by a doctor. </p>
<p>You should not use Effentora during childbirth because fentanyl may cause respiratory depression in 
the new-born child.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Fentanyl can get into breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed infant. Do not use 
Effentora if you are breast-feeding. You should not start breast-feeding until at least 5 days after the 
last dose of Effentora. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You should discuss with your doctor whether it is safe for you to drive, or operate machinery after 
taking Effentora. Do not drive or operate machinery if you: are feeling sleepy or dizzy; have blurred or 
double vision; or have difficulty in concentrating. It is important you know how you react to Effentora 
before driving or operating machinery. </p>

you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Dosage and frequency 
When you first start using Effentora, your doctor will work with you to find the dose that will relieve 
your breakthrough pain. It is very important that you use Effentora exactly as the doctor tells you The 
initial dose is 100 micrograms. During determination of your right dose, your doctor may instruct you 
to take more than one tablet per episode. If your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 30 minutes, 
use only 1 more tablet of Effentora during the titration period. </p>
<p>Once the right dose has been determined with your doctor, use 1 tablet for an episode of breakthrough 
pain as a general rule. In the further course of treatment your requirement for analgesic therapy may 
change. Higher doses may be necessary. If your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 30 minutes, use 
only 1 more tablet of Effentora during this dose-readjustment period. 
Contact your doctor if your right dose of Effentora does not relieve your breakthrough pain. Your 
doctor will decide if your dose needs to be changed. </p>
<p>Wait at least 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with Effentora. </p>
<p>You must let your doctor know immediately if you are using Effentora more than four times per day, 
as a change may be required to your treatment regimen. Your doctor may change the treatment for 
your persistent pain; when your persistent pain is controlled, your doctor may need to change the dose 
of Effentora. If your doctor suspects Effentora-related increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia), a 
reduction of your Effentora dose may be considered (see section 2 under  Warnings and precautions ). 
For the most effective relief, let your doctor know about your pain and how Effentora is working for 
you, so that the dose can be changed if needed. </p>
<p>Do not change doses of Effentora or your other pain medicines on your own. Any change in dosage 
must be prescribed and monitored by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are not sure about the right dose, or if you have questions about taking this medicine, you 
should contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
Effentora buccal tablets are for oromucosal use. When you place a tablet in your mouth, it dissolves 
and the medicine is absorbed through the lining of your mouth, into the blood system. Taking the 
medicine in this way allows it to be absorbed quickly to relieve your breakthrough pain. </p>
<p>Taking the medicine 
* Open the blister only when you are ready to use the tablet. The tablet must be used immediately 
once removed from the blister. 
* Separate one of the blister units from the blister card by tearing apart at the perforations. 
* Bend the blister unit along the line where indicated. 
* Peel the blister backing to expose the tablet. Do NOT attempt to push the tablet through the blister, 
because this can damage the tablet. </p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the tablet from the blister unit and immediately place the entire tablet near a molar tooth 
between the gum and the cheek (as shown in the picture). Sometimes, your doctor may tell you to 
place the tablet under your tongue instead. </li>
<li>
<p>Do not attempt to crush or split the tablet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not bite, suck, chew, or swallow the tablet, as this will result in less pain relief than when taken 
as directed. </p>
</li>
<li>The tablet should be left between the cheek and gum until dissolved, which usually takes 
approximately 14 to 25 minutes. </li>
<li>You may feel a gentle bubbling sensation between your cheek and gum as the tablet dissolves. </li>
<li>In case of irritation, you may change the placement of the tablet on the gum. </li>
<li>After 30 minutes, if pieces of the tablet remain, they may be swallowed with a glass of water. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more Effentora than you should 
* The most common side effects are feeling sleepy, sick or dizzy. If you begin to feel very dizzy, or 
very sleepy before the tablet is completely dissolved, rinse your mouth with water and spit the 
remaining pieces of the tablet into a sink or toilet right away. 
* A serious side effect of Effentora is slow and/or shallow breathing. This can occur if your dose of 
Effentora is too high or if you take too much Effentora. In severe cases taking too much Effentora 
may also lead to coma. If you feel very dizzy, very sleepy or have slow or shallow breathing, 
please seek immediate medical assistance. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Effentora 
If the breakthrough pain is still ongoing, you may take Effentora as prescribed by your physician. If 
the breakthrough pain has stopped, do not take Effentora until the next breakthrough pain episode. </p>
<p>If you stop using Effentora 
You should discontinue Effentora when you no longer have any breakthrough pain. You must 
however continue to take your usual opioid pain relieving medicine to treat your persistent cancer pain 
as advised by your doctor. You may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side 
effects of Effentora when discontinuing Effentora. If you experience withdrawal symptoms or if you 
are concerned about your pain relief, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will evaluate if you 
need medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
