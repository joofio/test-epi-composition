  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Efient, which contains the active substance prasugrel, belongs to a group of medicines called anti-
platelet agents. Platelets are very small cell particles that circulate in the blood. When a blood vessel is 
damaged, for example if it is cut, platelets clump together to help form a blood clot (thrombus). 
Therefore, platelets are essential to help stop bleeding. If clots form within a hardened blood vessel 
such as an artery they can be very dangerous as they can cut off the blood supply, causing a heart attack 
(myocardial infarction), stroke or death. Clots in arteries supplying blood to the heart may also reduce 
the blood supply, causing unstable angina (a severe chest pain). </p>
<p>Efient inhibits the clumping of platelets and so reduces the chance of a blood clot forming. </p>
<p>You have been prescribed Efient because you have already had a heart attack or unstable angina and 
you have been treated with a procedure to open blocked arteries in the heart. You may also have had 
one or more stents placed to keep open a blocked or narrowed artery supplying blood to the heart. 
Efient reduces the chances of you having a further heart attack or stroke or of dying from one of these 
atherothrombotic events. Your doctor will also give you acetylsalicylic acid (e.g. aspirin), another anti-
platelet agent. </p>         </div>"""

agent please tell your doctor before starting treatment with Efient. If you then take Efient and 
experience allergic reactions that may be recognised as a rash, itching, a swollen face, swollen 
lips or shortness of breath you need to tell your doctor immediately. </p>

</li>
</ul>

* warfarin (an anti-coagulant), 
*  non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  for pain and fever (such as ibuprofen, naproxen, 
etoricoxib). 
If given together with Efient these medicines may increase the risk of bleeding. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking morphine or other opioids (used to treat severe pain). </p>
<p>Only take other medicines while you are on Efient if your doctor tells you that you can. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding

You should use Efient only after discussing with your doctor the potential benefits and any potential 
risks to your unborn child.

your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
