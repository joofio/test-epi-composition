  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Eklira Genuair is 
The active ingredient of Eklira Genuair is aclidinium bromide, which belongs to a group of medicines 
called bronchodilators. Bronchodilators relax airways and help keep bronchioles open. Eklira Genuair 
is a dry powder inhaler that uses your breath to deliver the medicine directly into your lungs. This 
makes it easier for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients to breathe. </p>
<p>What Eklira Genuair is used for 
Eklira Genuair is indicated to help open the airways and relieve symptoms of COPD, a serious, long-
term lung disease characterised by breathing difficulties. Regular use of Eklira Genuair can help you 
when you have ongoing shortness of breath related to your disease to help you minimise the effects of 
the disease on your everyday life and reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD 
symptoms for several days). </p>         </div>"""
