therapy in adult patients with confirmed Fabry disease. Fabry disease is a rare genetic disease that can 
affect many parts of the body. In patients with Fabry disease, a fat substance is not removed from the 
cells of their body, and builds up in the walls of blood vessels which can cause organ failure. This fat 
builds up in the cells of these patients because they do not have enough of an enzyme called  -
galactosidase-A, the enzyme responsible for breaking it down Elfabrio is used long-term to 
supplement or replace this enzyme in adult patients who have confirmed Fabry disease. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before Elfabrio is used. </p>
<p>If you are treated with Elfabrio, you may experience a side effect during or immediately following the 
drip (infusion) used to give the medicine (see section 4). This is known as an infusion-related 
reaction and can sometimes be severe. </p>
<ul>
<li>Infusion-related reactions include dizziness, headache, nausea, low blood pressure, tiredness and 
fever. If you experience an infusion-related reaction, you must tell your doctor immediately. </li>
<li>If you have an infusion-related reaction you may be given additional medicines to treat or help 
prevent future reactions. These medicines may include medicines used to treat allergies 
(antihistamines), medicines used to treat fever (antipyretics) and medicines to control 
inflammation (corticosteroids). </li>
<li>If the infusion-related reaction is severe, your doctor will stop the infusion immediately and 
start giving you appropriate medical treatment or slow down treatment rate. </li>
<li>If the infusion-related reactions are severe and/or there is a loss of effect from this medicine, 
your doctor will perform a blood test to check for antibodies that might affect the outcome of 
your treatment. </li>
<li>Most of the time you can still be given Elfabrio even if you experience an infusion-related 
reaction. </li>
</ul>
<p>In very rare cases, your immune system may not be able to recognise Elfabrio, leading to an 
immunological kidney disease (glomerulonephritis membranoproliferative). During the clinical 
studies, only one case occurred, and the only symptoms reported were a temporary decline of renal 
functions with excess proteins in the urine. The symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of the 
treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children and adolescents. The safety and efficacy of Elfabrio in 
children and adolescents aged 0-17 years have not been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Elfabrio 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not use Elfabrio if you are pregnant, since there is no experience with Elfabrio in pregnant 
women. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether Elfabrio is excreted in human milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding 
or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or stop taking 
Elfabrio, considering the benefit of breast-feeding for your baby and the benefit of Elfabrio for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Elfabrio may cause dizziness or vertigo. If you feel dizzy or vertigo on the day of treatment with 
Elfabrio, do not to drive or use machines until you feel better. </p>
<p>Elfabrio contains sodium 
This medicine contains 48 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""
