anticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which 
is an important component of blood clotting. </p>
<p>Eliquis is used in adults: 
- to prevent blood clots (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) from forming after hip or knee 
replacement operations. After an operation to the hip or knee you may be at a higher risk of 
developing blood clots in your leg veins. This can cause the legs to swell, with or without pain. 
If a blood clot travels from your leg to your lungs, it can block blood flow causing 
breathlessness, with or without chest pain. This condition (pulmonary embolism) can be 
life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial 
fibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the 
brain and lead to a stroke or to other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also 
known as a systemic embolism). A stroke can be life-threatening and requires immediate 
medical attention. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of 
your lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels of your legs and/or lungs. </p>

- you are allergic to apixaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
- you are bleeding excessively; 
- you have a disease in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious bleeding (such as 
an active or a recent ulcer of your stomach or bowel, recent bleeding in your brain); 
- you have a liver disease which leads to increased risk of bleeding (hepatic coagulopathy); 
- you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g., warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or 
heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment, while having a venous or arterial line 
and you get heparin through this line to keep it open, or if a tube is inserted into your blood 
vessel (catheter ablation) to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you take this medicine if you have any of the 
following: 
- an increased risk of bleeding, such as: 
- bleeding disorders, including conditions resulting in reduced platelet activity; 
- very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment; 
- you are older than 75 years; 
- you weigh 60 kg or less; 
- a severe kidney disease or if you are on dialysis; 
- a liver problem or a history of liver problems; 
- This medicine will be used with caution in patients with signs of altered liver function. 
- had a tube (catheter) or an injection into your spinal column (for anaesthesia or pain 
reduction), your doctor will tell you to take this medicine 5 hours or more after catheter 
removal; 
- if you have a prosthetic heart valve; 
- if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical 
procedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. </p>
<p>Take special care with Eliquis 
- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed. </p>
<p>If you need to have surgery or a procedure which may cause bleeding, your doctor might ask you to 
temporarily stop taking this medicine for a short while. If you are not sure whether a procedure may 
cause bleeding ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Eliquis 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and some may decrease its effects. Your doctor 
will decide, if you should be treated with Eliquis when taking these medicines and how closely you 
should be monitored. </p>
<p>The following medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and increase the chance for unwanted 
bleeding: 
- some medicines for fungal infections (e.g., ketoconazole, etc.); 
- some antiviral medicines for HIV/AIDS (e.g., ritonavir); 
- other medicines that are used to reduce blood clotting (e.g., enoxaparin, etc.); 
- anti-inflammatory or pain medicines (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid or naproxen). Especially, if 
you are older than 75 years and are taking acetylsalicylic acid, you may have an increased 
chance of bleeding; 
- medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g., diltiazem); 
- antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or serotonin 
norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors. </p>
<p>The following medicines may reduce the ability of Eliquis to help prevent blood clots from forming: 
- medicines to prevent epilepsy or seizures (e.g., phenytoin, etc.); 
- St Johnâ€™s Wort (a herbal supplement used for depression); 
- medicines to treat tuberculosis or other infections (e.g., rifampicin). </p>

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>The effects of Eliquis on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. You should not take this 
medicine if you are pregnant. Contact your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking
