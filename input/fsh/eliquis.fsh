anticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming by blocking Factor Xa, which 
is an important component of blood clotting. </p>
<p>Eliquis is used in adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to prevent blood clots (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) from forming after hip or knee 
replacement operations. After an operation to the hip or knee you may be at a higher risk of 
developing blood clots in your leg veins. This can cause the legs to swell, with or without pain. 
If a blood clot travels from your leg to your lungs, it can block blood flow causing 
breathlessness, with or without chest pain. This condition (pulmonary embolism) can be 
life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to prevent a blood clot from forming in the heart in patients with an irregular heart beat (atrial 
fibrillation) and at least one additional risk factor. Blood clots may break off and travel to the 
brain and lead to a stroke or to other organs and prevent normal blood flow to that organ (also 
known as a systemic embolism). A stroke can be life-threatening and requires immediate 
medical attention. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels of 
your lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels of your legs and/or lungs. </p>

<li>you are allergic to apixaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); </li>
<li>you are bleeding excessively; </li>
<li>you have a disease in an organ of the body that increases the risk of serious bleeding (such as 
an active or a recent ulcer of your stomach or bowel, recent bleeding in your brain); </li>
<li>you have a liver disease which leads to increased risk of bleeding (hepatic coagulopathy); </li>
<li>you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g., warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or 
heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment, while having a venous or arterial line 
and you get heparin through this line to keep it open, or if a tube is inserted into your blood 
vessel (catheter ablation) to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you take this medicine if you have any of the 
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an increased risk of bleeding, such as:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bleeding disorders, including conditions resulting in reduced platelet activity; </p>
</li>
<li>very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment; </li>
<li>you are older than 75 years; </li>
<li>you weigh 60 kg or less; </li>
<li>a severe kidney disease or if you are on dialysis; </li>
<li>a liver problem or a history of liver problems; </li>
<li>This medicine will be used with caution in patients with signs of altered liver function. </li>

reduction), your doctor will tell you to take this medicine 5 hours or more after catheter 
removal; </li>
<li>if you have a prosthetic heart valve; </li>
<li>if your doctor determines that your blood pressure is unstable or another treatment or surgical 
procedure to remove the blood clot from your lungs is planned. </li>
</ul>
<p>Take special care with Eliquis 
- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed. </p>
<p>If you need to have surgery or a procedure which may cause bleeding, your doctor might ask you to 
temporarily stop taking this medicine for a short while. If you are not sure whether a procedure may 
cause bleeding ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Eliquis 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and some may decrease its effects. Your doctor 
will decide, if you should be treated with Eliquis when taking these medicines and how closely you 
should be monitored. </p>
<p>The following medicines may increase the effects of Eliquis and increase the chance for unwanted 
bleeding:</p>
<ul>
<li>some medicines for fungal infections (e.g., ketoconazole, etc.); </li>
<li>some antiviral medicines for HIV/AIDS (e.g., ritonavir); </li>
<li>other medicines that are used to reduce blood clotting (e.g., enoxaparin, etc.); </li>
<li>anti-inflammatory or pain medicines (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid or naproxen). Especially, if 
you are older than 75 years and are taking acetylsalicylic acid, you may have an increased 
chance of bleeding; </li>
<li>medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g., diltiazem); </li>
<li>antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or serotonin 
norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following medicines may reduce the ability of Eliquis to help prevent blood clots from forming:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines to prevent epilepsy or seizures (e.g., phenytoin, etc.); </li>
<li>St John s Wort (a herbal supplement used for depression); </li>
<li>medicines to treat tuberculosis or other infections (e.g., rifampicin). </li>

<ul>
<li>you have severely reduced kidney function; </li>
<li>
<p>two or more of the following apply to you:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your blood test results suggest poor kidney function (value of serum creatinine is 
1.5 mg/dL (133 micromole/L) or greater); </p>

<p>To treat blood clots in the veins of your legs and blood clots in the blood vessels of your lungs 
The recommended dose is two tablets of Eliquis 5 mg twice a day for the first 7 days, for example, 
two in the morning and two in the evening. 
After 7 days the recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 5 mg twice a day, for example, one in the 
morning and one in the evening. </p>
<p>For preventing blood clots from re-occurring following completion of 6 months of treatment 
The recommended dose is one tablet of Eliquis 2.5 mg twice a day for example, one in the morning 
and one in the evening. 
Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment for. </p>
<p>Your doctor might change your anticoagulant treatment as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changing from Eliquis to anticoagulant medicines 
Stop taking Eliquis. Start treatment with the anticoagulant medicines (for example heparin) at the time 
you would have taken the next tablet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from anticoagulant medicines to Eliquis 
Stop taking the anticoagulant medicines. Start treatment with Eliquis at the time you would have had 
the next dose of anticoagulant medicine, then continue as normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from treatment with anticoagulant containing vitamin K antagonist (e.g., warfarin) to 
Eliquis 
Stop taking the medicine containing a vitamin K antagonist. Your doctor needs to do 
blood-measurements and instruct you when to start taking Eliquis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from Eliquis to anticoagulant treatment containing vitamin K antagonist (e.g., 
warfarin). 
If your doctor tells you that you have to start taking the medicine containing a vitamin K antagonist, 
continue to take Eliquis for at least 2 days after your first dose of the medicine containing a vitamin K 
antagonist. Your doctor needs to do blood-measurements and instruct you when to stop taking Eliquis. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Patients undergoing cardioversion 
If your abnormal heartbeat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take 
this medicine at the times your doctor tells you, to prevent blood clots in blood vessels in your brain 
and other blood vessels in your body. </p>
<p>If you take more Eliquis than you should 
Tell your doctor immediately if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of this medicine. Take 
the medicine pack with you, even if there are no tablets left. </p>
<p>If you take more Eliquis than recommended, you may have an increased risk of bleeding. If bleeding 
occurs, surgery, blood transfusions, or other treatments that may reverse anti-factor Xa activity may be 
required. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Eliquis 
- Take the dose as soon as you remember and:</p>
<ul>
<li>take the next dose of Eliquis at the usual time </li>
<li>then continue as normal. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure what to do or have missed more than one dose, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Eliquis 
Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first, because the risk of developing a 
blood clot could be higher if you stop treatment too early. </p>
