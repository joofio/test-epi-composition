<p>ellaOne is a contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or if your contraceptive 
method has failed. For example: 
- if you had sex without protection;<br />
- if your or your partner’s condom tore, slipped or came off, or if you forgot to use one; 
- if you did not take your contraceptive pill as recommended.  </p>
<p>You should take the tablet as soon as possible after sex, and within a maximum of 5 days (120 hours). 
This is because it is more effective if you take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex. </p>
<p>This medicine is suitable for any woman of childbearing age, including adolescents.  </p>
<p>You can take the tablet at any time in the menstrual cycle. </p>
<p>ellaOne does not work if you are already pregnant   </p>
<p>If your menstrual period is late, there is a possibility that you may be pregnant. When your period is 
late or when you have symptoms of pregnancy (heavy breasts, morning sickness) you should consult a 
doctor or other healthcare professional before taking the tablet.  </p>
<p>If you have unprotected sex after taking the tablet, it will not stop you from becoming pregnant. 
Unprotected sex at any time during your cycle can lead to pregnancy. </p>
<p>ellaOne is not to be used for regular contraception </p>
<p>If you do not have a regular method of contraception, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional to 
choose one that is suitable for you. </p>
<p>How ellaOne works </p>
<p>ellaOne contains the substance ulipristal acetate which acts by modifying the activity of the natural 
hormone progesterone which is necessary for ovulation to occur. As a result, this medicine works by 
postponing ovulation. Emergency contraception is not effective in every case. Of 100 women who 
take this medicine approximately 2 will become pregnant.  </p>
<p>This medicine is a contraceptive used to prevent a pregnancy from starting. If you are already 
pregnant, it will not interrupt an existing pregnancy. </p>
<p>Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections </p>
<p>Only condoms can protect you from sexually transmitted infections. This medicine will not protect 
you against HIV infection or any other sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. chlamydia, genital herpes, 
genital warts, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B and syphilis). Ask a healthcare professional for advice if you are 
worried about this.  </p>
<p>There is more information about contraception at the end of this leaflet. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to ulipristal acetate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare professional before taking this medicine 
- if your period is late or you have symptoms of pregnancy (heavy breasts, morning sickness), as 
you may already be pregnant (see section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility”); 
- if you suffer from severe asthma; 
- if you suffer from severe liver disease. </p>
<p>In all women, emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected 
intercourse. There is some evidence that this medicine may be less effective with increasing body 
weight or body mass index (BMI), but these data were limited and inconclusive. Therefore, ellaOne is 
still recommended for all women regardless of their weight or BMI.  </p>
<p>You are advised to speak to a healthcare professional if you are concerned about any problems related 
to taking emergency contraception. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant despite taking the tablet, it is important that you see your doctor. See section 
“Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility” for more information.  </p>
<p>Other contraceptives and ellaOne 
This medicine may make regular hormonal contraceptives, like pills and patches, temporarily less 
effective. If you are currently taking hormonal contraception, continue to use it as usual after taking 
this medicine, but be sure to use condoms every time you have sex until your next period. </p>
<p>Do not take this medicine together with another emergency contraceptive pill that contains 
levonorgestrel. By taking them both together, you might make this medicine less effective. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ellaOne 
Tell your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare professional if you are taking or have recently taken 
any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may prevent ellaOne from working effectively. If you have used any of the medicines 
listed below during the last 4 weeks, ellaOne may be less suitable for you. Your doctor may prescribe 
another type of (non-hormonal) emergency contraceptive, i.e. a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD): 
- medicines used to treat epilepsy (for example, primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
fosphenytoine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and barbiturates) 
- medicines used to treat tuberculosis (for example, rifampicin, rifabutin) 
- a treatment for HIV (ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine)<br />
- a medicine used to treat fungal infections (griseofulvin) 
- herbal remedies containing St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). </p>
<p>Speak to your doctor or pharmacist before using ellaOne when you use (or have recently used) any of 
the medicines stated above. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
Pregnancy </p>
<p>Before taking this medicine, if your period is late, tell your pharmacist, doctor or other healthcare 
professional, or do a pregnancy test in order to make sure you are not already pregnant (see section 
“Warning and precautions”).  </p>
<p>This medicine is a contraceptive used to prevent a pregnancy from starting. If you are already pregnant 
it will not interrupt an existing pregnancy. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant despite taking this medicine, there is no evidence that it will affect your 
pregnancy. However, it is important that you see your doctor. As for any pregnancy, your doctor may 
want to check that the pregnancy is not outside the womb. This is especially important if you have 
severe abdominal (stomach) pain or bleeding or if you have previously had a pregnancy outside the 
womb, tubal surgery or long term (chronic) genital infection.  </p>
<p>If you become pregnant despite taking ellaOne, you are encouraged to ask your doctor to register your 
pregnancy in an official registry. You can also report this information on your own at 
www.hra-pregnancy-registry.com.Your information will remain anonymous – nobody will know it is 
information about you. Sharing your information may help women in the future understand the safety 
or risks of ellaOne during a pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you take this medicine while you are breast-feeding a baby, do not breast-feed for one week after 
taking this medicine. During this time, it is recommended to use a breast pump in order to maintain 
milk production, but throw away your breast milk. The effect of breast-feeding your baby in the week 
after taking this medicine is not known. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>This medicine will not affect your future fertility. If you have unprotected sex after taking the tablet, it 
will not stop you from becoming pregnant. Therefore it is important you use condoms until your next 
period.<br />
If you wish to start or continue with a regular method of contraception after using this medicine, you 
can do so but you should also use condoms until your next period. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
After taking this medicine, some women experience dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision and/or loss 
of concentration (see section 4). If you experience these symptoms, do not drive or use machines  </p>
<p>ellaOne contains lactose<br />
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>ellaOne contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
