gonadotropic hormones. Gonadotropic hormones play an important role in human fertility and 
reproduction. One of these gonadotropic hormones is Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which is 
needed in women for the growth and development of follicles (small round sacs in your ovaries that 
contain the eggs) and in adolescent males (14 years and older) for treatment of delayed puberty due to 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), in combination with a medicine called human Chorionic 
Gonadotropin (hCG).  </p>
<p>In women 
Elonva is used to help achieve pregnancy in women having infertility treatment, such as in vitro 
fertilisation (IVF). IVF involves collecting the eggs from the ovary, fertilising them in the laboratory, 
and transferring the embryos into the uterus a few days later. Elonva causes the growth and 
development of several follicles at the same time by a controlled stimulation of the ovaries. </p>
<p>In adolescent males (14 years and older) 
Elonva is used to bring about the development and function of the testes and induce the development 
of male sexual characteristics in adolescent males with delayed puberty due to HH.  </p>         </div>"""

the beginning of a menstrual cycle) higher than<br />
Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Elonva. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
Treatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS). This is a serious medical condition where the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing 
follicles become larger than normal. In rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Therefore, 
close supervision by your doctor is very important. To check the effects of treatment, your doctor will 
do ultrasound scans of your ovaries. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. (See also 
section 4.) </p>
<p>OHSS causes fluid to build up suddenly in your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to 
form. Call your doctor right away if you have: 
- severe abdominal swelling and pain in the stomach area (abdomen) 
- feeling sick (nausea) 
- vomiting 
- sudden weight gain due to fluid build up 
- diarrhoea 
- decreased urine output 
- trouble breathing </p>
<p>You may use Elonva only once during the same treatment cycle, otherwise, the chance of having 
OHSS may increase. </p>
<p>Before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation 
syndrome (OHSS). </p>
<p>Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary. Twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the 
ovary to be cut off.  </p>
<p>Before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
- have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
- are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant.<br />
- have ever had stomach (abdominal) surgery. 
- have ever had a twisting of an ovary. 
- have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries. </p>
<p>Blood clot (Thrombosis) 
Treatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva may (just as pregnancy) increase the risk of 
having a blood clot (thrombosis). Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. </p>
<p>Blood clots can cause serious medical conditions, such as: 
- blockage in your lungs (pulmonary embolus) 
- stroke 
- heart attack<br />
- blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis) 
- a lack of blood flow (deep venous thrombosis) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg. </p>
<p>Please discuss this with your doctor, before starting treatment, especially if: 
- you know you already have an increased chance of having a thrombosis 
- you, or anyone in your immediate family, have ever had a thrombosis 
- you are severely overweight. </p>
<p>Multiple births or birth defects 
There is an increased chance of having twins or even more than two babies, even when only one 
embryo is transferred into the uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry an increased health risk for both the 
mother and her babies. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of couples with fertility 
problems (e.g., a woman’s age, certain sperm problems, genetic background of both parents) may also 
be associated with an increased chance of birth defects. </p>
<p>Pregnancy complications 
If treatment with Elonva results in pregnancy, there is a higher chance of pregnancy outside the uterus 
(an ectopic pregnancy). Therefore, your doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to 
exclude the possibility of pregnancy outside the uterus. </p>
<p>Ovarian and other reproductive system tumours 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had 
infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these 
tumours in infertile women. </p>
<p>Other medical conditions 
In addition, before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
- have kidney disease. 
- have uncontrolled pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems. 
- have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). 
- have adrenal glands that are not working properly (adrenocortical insufficiency). 
- have high prolactin levels in the blood (hyperprolactinemia). 
- have any other medical conditions (for example, diabetes, heart disease, or any other long-term 
disease). 
- have been told by a doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Elonva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>If you do a pregnancy test during your infertility treatment with Elonva, the test might wrongly 
suggest that you are pregnant. Your doctor will advise you at what time you can start performing 
pregnancy tests. In case of a positive pregnancy test, contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not use Elonva if you are already pregnant, or think that you might be pregnant, or if you 
are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Elonva may cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy, you should not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Elonva contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>In women 
Elonva is used in women having infertility treatment like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). During this 
treatment, Elonva is used in combination with a medicine (so called GnRH-antagonist) to prevent your 
ovary from releasing an egg too early. Treatment with the GnRH-antagonist usually starts 5 to 6 days 
after the injection of Elonva. </p>
<p>The use of Elonva in combination with a GnRH agonist (another medicine to prevent your ovary from 
releasing an egg too early) is not recommended. </p>
<p>In adolescent males (14 years and older) 
Elonva in combination with a medicine called hCG, is used for treatment of delayed puberty due to 
HH. Elonva should be administered once every two weeks, in the morning on the same day of the 
week. </p>
<p>Dose </p>
<p>Women 
In the treatment of women of reproductive age, the dose of Elonva is based on weight and age. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A single 100-microgram dose is recommended in women who weigh less than or equal to 
60 kilograms and who are 36 years of age or younger. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single 150-microgram dose is recommended in women: </p>
</li>
<li>who weigh more than 60 kilograms, regardless of age. </li>
<li>who weigh 50 kilograms or more and who are older than 36 years of age. </li>
</ul>
<p>Women older than 36 years of age who weighed less than 50 kilograms were not studied. </p>

<p>During the first seven days after the injection with Elonva, you should not use (recombinant) Follicle 
Stimulating Hormone ((rec)FSH). Seven days after the injection of Elonva, your doctor may decide to 
continue your stimulation cycle with another gonadotropic hormone, like (rec)FSH. This may be 
continued for a few days until enough follicles of adequate size are present. This can be checked by 
ultrasound examination. Treatment with (rec)FSH is then stopped and the eggs are matured by giving 
hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin). The eggs are collected from the ovary 34-36 hours later. </p>
<p>In adolescent males (14 years and older) 
The dose of Elonva is based on body weight: </p>
<p>For adolescent males weighing less than or equal to 60 kg 
- 100 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by administration of 
Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG. If your body weight increases to greater than 60 kg 
during treatment, your doctor may increase your dose of Elonva to 150 micrograms. </p>
<p>For adolescent males weighing more than 60 kg 
- 150 micrograms of Elonva once every two weeks for 12 weeks, followed by administration of 
Elonva (once every 2 weeks) with hCG. </p>
<p>The combination therapy with hCG twice weekly (500 – 5000 IU) may be necessary for 52 weeks or 
longer to achieve adult gonadal development. </p>
<p>How Elonva is given 
Treatment with Elonva should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility 
problems. Elonva must be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) into a skin fold (that you pinch 
between your thumb and index finger), preferably just below the navel. The injection may be given by 
a healthcare professional (for example a nurse), your partner or yourself, if carefully instructed by 
your doctor. Always use Elonva exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure. A step-by-step “instructions for use” is given at the end of this 
leaflet. </p>
<p>Do not inject Elonva into a muscle.  </p>
<p>Elonva is supplied in pre-filled syringes that have an automatic safety system to help prevent needle 
stick injuries after use. </p>
<p>If you use more Elonva or (rec)FSH than you should 
If you think you have used more Elonva or (rec)FSH than you should, contact your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Elonva 
If you forgot to inject Elonva on the day you should have, contact your doctor immediately. Do not 
inject Elonva without talking with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Serious side effects </p>
<p>A possible complication of treatment with gonadotropic hormones like Elonva is unwanted 
overstimulation of the ovaries. The chance of having this complication can be reduced by carefully 
monitoring the number of maturing follicles. Your doctor will do ultrasound scans of your ovaries to 
carefully monitor the number of maturing follicles. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. 
The first symptoms of ovarian overstimulation may be noticed as pain in the stomach (abdomen), 
feeling sick or diarrhoea. Ovarian overstimulation may develop into a medical condition called ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be a serious medical problem. In more severe cases 
this may lead to enlargement of the ovaries, collection of fluid in the abdomen and/or chest (which 
may cause sudden weight gain due to fluid buildup) or clots in the blood vessels. 
Contact your doctor without delay if you have pain in the stomach (abdomen) or any of the other 
symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation, even if they occur some days after the injection has been 
given. </p>
<p>The chance of having a side effect is described by the following categories: </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 women) 
- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
- Pelvic pain 
- Feeling sick (nausea) 
- Headache 
- Pelvic discomfort 
- Breast tenderness 
- Tiredness (fatigue) </p>
<p>Uncommon ( may affect up to 1 in 100 women) 
- Twisting of an ovary (ovarian torsion) 
- Liver enzyme increases 
- Miscarriage 
- Pain after oocyte retrieval 
- Procedural pain 
- Releasing an egg too early (premature ovulation) 
- Abdominal distension 
- Vomiting 
- Diarrhoea 
- Constipation 
- Back pain 
- Breast pain<br />
- Bruising or pain at the injection site 
- Irritability 
- Mood swings 
- Dizziness 
- Hot flush </p>
<p>Not known (cannot be estimated from available data) 
- Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions, both local and generalised, including rash).  </p>
<p>Pregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy) and multiple pregnancies have also been reported. 
These side effects are not considered to be related to the use of Elonva, but to Assisted Reproductive 
Technology (ART) or subsequent pregnancy. </p>
<p>In rare instances, blood clots (thrombosis) that formed inside a blood vessel, broke off, and travelled 
inside the bloodstream to block another blood vessel (thromboembolism) have been associated with 
Elonva therapy as with other gonadotropins. </p>
<p>If you are an adolescent male<br />
Side effects reported in adolescent males: </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 males) 
- Vomiting 
- Injection site pain 
- Hot flush </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
