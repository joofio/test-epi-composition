  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>ELREXFIO is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance elranatamab. It is used to treat 
adults with a type of cancer of the bone marrow called multiple myeloma. 
It is used by itself for patients whose cancer has returned (relapsed) and stopped responding to 
previous treatments (refractory), who have had at least three other kinds of treatment and whose 
cancer has worsened since receiving the last treatment. </p>
<p>How ELREXFIO works 
ELREXFIO is an antibody, a type of protein, which has been designed to recognise and attach to 
specific targets in your body. ELREXFIO targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is found 
on multiple myeloma cancer cells, and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), which is found on T 
lymphocytes, a particular kind of white blood cell in your immune system. This medicine works by 
attaching to these targets and, by doing so, bringing the cancer cells and T cells together. This helps 
your immune system destroy the multiple myeloma cancer cells. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You must not be given ELREXFIO<br />
If you are allergic to elranatamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are not sure if you are allergic, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given ELREXFIO. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Tell your doctor or nurse about all of your medical conditions before you are given ELREXFIO, 
including if you have had any recent infections. </p>
<p>Look out for serious side effects. 
Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you experience any of the following: 
* Signs of a condition known as  cytokine release syndrome  (CRS). CRS is a serious immune 
reaction with symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, chills, headache, low blood 
pressure, fast heartbeat, feeling dizzy, and increased levels of liver enzymes in the blood. 
* Effects on your nervous system. Symptoms include feeling confused, feeling less alert, or 
having difficulty speaking or writing. Some of these may be signs of a serious immune 
reaction called  immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome  (ICANS). 
* Signs and symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills, fatigue, or difficulty breathing. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any signs of the above. </p>
<p>ELREXFIO and vaccines 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given ELREXFIO if you have had a recent vaccination or 
are going to have a vaccination. </p>
<p>You should not receive live vaccines within the four weeks before your first dose of ELREXFIO, 
while you are treated with ELREXFIO, and at least four weeks after stopping treatment with 
ELREXFIO. </p>
<p>Tests and checks 
Before you are given ELREXFIO, your doctor will check your blood counts for signs of infection. If 
you have any infection, it will be treated before you start ELREXFIO. Your doctor will also check if 
you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>During treatment with ELREXFIO, your doctor will monitor you for side effects. Your doctor will 
monitor you for signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS for 48 hours after each of your first two 
doses of ELREXFIO. Your doctor will also regularly check your blood counts, as the number of blood 
cells and other blood components may decrease. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ELREXFIO is not intended for children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known how the medicine will affect them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ELREXFIO 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
(e.g., cyclosporine, phenytoin, sirolimus, and warfarin). This includes medicines you can get without a 
prescription, and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is not known if ELREXFIO affects an unborn baby or if it passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Pregnancy-information for women </p>
<p>ELREXFIO is not recommended during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse before receiving ELREXFIO if you are pregnant, think you might be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby. </p>
<p>If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. </p>
<p>Contraception </p>
<p>If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months 
after stopping treatment with ELREXFIO. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed during treatment and for 6 months after stopping treatment with 
ELREXFIO. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some people may feel tired, dizzy, or confused while receiving ELREXFIO. Do not drive, use tools, 
or operate machines until at least 48 hours after each of your 2 step-up doses, and until your symptoms 
improve, or as instructed by your healthcare professional. </p>
<p>ELREXFIO contains sodium 
ELREXFIO contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free.  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>How much is given 
You will receive ELREXFIO under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in cancer 
treatment. The recommended dose of ELREXFIO is 76 mg, but the first two doses will be lower. </p>
<p>ELREXFIO is given as follows: 
* You will receive a first step-up dose of 12 mg on Day 1 of Week 1. * You will then receive a second step-up dose of 32 mg on Day 4 of Week 1. * From Week 2 to Week 24 (Day 1), you will receive a full treatment dose of 76 mg once a 
week, as long as you are getting benefit from ELREXFIO. 
* From Week 25 onwards, your doctor may change your treatment from once a week to once 
every two weeks, as long as your cancer has responded to ELREXFIO treatment. </p>
<p>You should stay close to a healthcare facility for 48 hours after each of the first two step-up doses in 
case you have side effects. Your doctor will monitor you for side effects for 48 hours after each of 
your first two doses. </p>
<p>How the medicine is given 
ELREXFIO will always be given to you by your doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin 
(subcutaneous). It is given in the stomach area or thigh. </p>
<p>You may get a reaction at the injection site including, redness of the skin, pain, swelling, bruising, 
rash, itching, or bleeding. These effects are usually mild and clear up by themselves without the need 
for any additional treatment. </p>
<p>Other medicines given during treatment with ELREXFIO 
You will be given medicines one hour before each of your first three doses of ELREXFIO. These help 
to lower the chance of side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (see section 4). These medicines 
may include: 
* Medicines to reduce the risk of fever (such as paracetamol) 
* Medicines to reduce the risk of inflammation (corticosteroids) 
* Medicines to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction (antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine) </p>
<p>You may also be given these medicines for later doses of ELREXFIO based on any symptoms you 
have after taking ELREXFIO. </p>
<p>You may also be given additional medicines based on any symptoms you experience or your medical 
history. </p>
<p>If you are given more ELREXFIO than you should 
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much 
(an overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects. </p>
<p>If you miss your appointment to have ELREXFIO 
It is very important to go to all your appointments to make sure your treatment works. If you miss an 
appointment, make another one as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
