It can be administered by hand or by an automatic injector. </p>
<p>Your doctor or radiologist will determine the dose you will receive and supervise the injection. 
The usual dose of 0.1 mL/kg body weight is the same in adults and children of 2 years and older. </p>
<p>In children, your doctor or radiologist will use Elucirem in vials with a single use syringe to be able to 
have a better precision of the injected volume. </p>
<p>After the injection, you will be kept under supervision for at least 30 minutes. This is the time where most 
undesired reactions (such as allergic reactions) may occur. However, in rare cases, reactions may occur 
after hours or days.  </p>
<p>Use in patients with severe kidney problems 
The use of Elucirem is not recommended in patients with severe kidney problems. However, if it is 
required you should only receive one dose of Elucirem during a scan and you should not receive a second 
injection for at least 7 days. </p>
<p>Use in elderly 
It is not necessary to adjust your dose if you are 65 years of age or older, but you may have a blood test to 
check how well your kidneys are working. </p>
<p>If you receive more Elucirem than you should </p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that you will receive an overdose of Elucirem, as it will be given to you by a trained 
healthcare professional. If it does happen, Elucirem can be removed from the body by haemodialysis 
(blood cleaning). </p>
