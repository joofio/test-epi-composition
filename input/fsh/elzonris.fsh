<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before using ELZONRIS and during treatment if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>suddenly gain weight after starting treatment, have new or worsening swelling of your face, limbs 
or joints (oedema) or dizziness (a symptom of low blood pressure). These may be signs of a 
potentially life-threatening condition known as capillary leak syndrome. For more information see 
 Capillary Leak Syndrome  in section 4. - get a whistling sound during breathing (wheezing) or have difficulty breathing, hives/ rash, 
itching, or swelling (signs of an allergic reaction).  </li>
<li>have been told you have a low level of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia). </li>
<li>
<p>have been told you have a low level of a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil (neutropenia). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have dizziness, decreased urination, confusion, vomiting, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath, or 
changes in heart rhythm (signs of  tumour lysis syndrome). </p>
</li>
<li>have abnormal liver test results (possible sign of serious liver injury). </li>
<li>have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder which means you can t break 
down sugar in foods and drinks.  </li>
<li>have kidney or liver problems. </li>
<li>start getting headaches, or feeling confused or drowsy, or having speech, vision or memory 
problems. </li>
<li>have been told you have cancer in your central nervous system (CNS). You may be given a 
different medicine to treat this. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you and perform regular blood tests to make sure that it is safe for you to use 
this medicine. If you have any problems, your treatment may be temporarily stopped and started again 
when you feel better. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ELZONRIS is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. This is because there is limited 
information on how well it works in this age group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and ELZONRIS<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant unless you and your doctor decide that the 
benefit to you outweighs the potential risk to the unborn baby .  </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed during treatment with ELZONRIS and for at least 1 week after your last 
dose. It is not known if ELZONRIS passes into breast-milk. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who can become pregnant, you will have a pregnancy test about a week before 
starting treatment with ELZONRIS.  </p>
<p>You should continue to take your contraception for at least 1 week after your last dose of ELZONRIS. 
Talk to your doctor about the best contraception for you and before stopping your contraception.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Tagraxofusp is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>ELZONRIS contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic 
disorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which 
may cause serious side effects. </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI or if you can no longer take 
sweet foods or drinks because you feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach 
cramps or diarrhoea. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>About an hour before your treatment begins, you will be given medicines to help prevent an allergic 
reaction, including anti-histamines, a corticosteroid and paracetamol.  </p>

doctor. The daily recommended dose is 12 micrograms per kilogram of your body weight.  It is given 
as a 15-minute drip into a vein (intravenous infusion), once a day, for the first 5 days of a 21-day 
cycle. </p>

treatment and for at least 24 hours after the last dose. </p>

you will receive. </p>
<p>If the first cycle does not cause troublesome side effects, your next cycle of treatment may be given in 
a clinic. You will be monitored during treatment. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of ELZONRIS<br />
It is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive ELZONRIS. If you miss an 
appointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose.  </p>
