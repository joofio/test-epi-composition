"neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists". The brain has a specific area that controls nausea and
vomiting. EMEND works by blocking signals to that area, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting.
EMEND capsules are used in adults and adolescents from the age of 12 years in combination with
other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (cancer treatment) that are
strong and moderate triggers of nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin or epirubicin).</p>         </div>"""

- if you or the child is allergic to aprepitant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed
in section 6).
- with medicines containing pimozide (used to treat psychiatric illnesses), terfenadine and
astemizole (used for hay fever and other allergic conditions), cisapride (used for treating
digestive problems). Tell the doctor if you or the child is taking these medicines since the
treatment must be modified before you or the child start taking EMEND.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to the doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you take EMEND or give this medicine to the child.
Before treatment with EMEND, tell the doctor if you or the child have liver disease because the liver
is important in breaking down the medicine in the body. The doctor may therefore have to monitor the
condition of your or the child s liver.
Children and adolescents
Do not give EMEND 80 mg and 125 mg capsules to children under 12 years of age, because the
80 mg and 125 mg capsules have not been studied in this population.
Other medicines and EMEND
EMEND can affect other medicines both during and after treatment with EMEND. There are some
medicines that should not be taken with EMEND (such as pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, and
cisapride) or that require a dose adjustment (see also  Do not take EMEND ).

together with other medicines including those listed below. Please talk to the doctor or pharmacist if
you or the child is taking any of the following medicines:</p>

pregnant or breast-feeding, may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask the doctor for advice
before taking this medicine.

recommended during treatment with this medicine. It is important to tell the doctor if you or the child
are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
It should be taken into account that some people feel dizzy and sleepy after taking EMEND. If you or
the child feels dizzy or sleepy, avoid driving, riding a bicycle or using machines or tools after taking
this medicine (see  Possible side effects ).
EMEND contains sucrose
EMEND capsules contain sucrose. If you or the child have been told by your doctor that you or the
child have an intolerance to some sugars, contact the doctor before taking this medicine.
