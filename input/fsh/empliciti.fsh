designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body. Elotuzumab attaches to a 
target protein called SLAMF7. SLAMF7 is found in large amounts on the surface of multiple 
myeloma cells and on certain cells of your immune system (natural killer cells). When elotuzumab 
binds to SLAMF7 on the multiple myeloma or natural killer cells, it stimulates your immune system to 
attack and destroy the multiple myeloma cells. </p>
<p>Empliciti is used to treat multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in adults. Empliciti will be 
given to you together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or together with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called plasma cells. These 
cells divide out of control and collect in the bone marrow. This results in damage to the bones and 
kidneys. </p>
<p>Empliciti is used if your cancer has not responded to, or has come back after certain treatments. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Infusion related reaction 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion related reactions listed at the top 
of section 4. These side effects mostly occur during or after the infusion of the first dose. You will be 
monitored for signs of such effects during and after the infusion. </p>
<p>Depending on the seriousness of the infusion related reactions, you may require additional treatment to 
prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, or your infusion of Empliciti may be interrupted. 
When the symptoms go away or improve, the infusion can be continued more slowly and speeded up </p>
<p>gradually if the symptoms do not recur. Your doctor may decide not to continue Empliciti treatment if 
you have a strong infusion related reaction. </p>
<p>Before each infusion of Empliciti, you will be given medicines to reduce infusion related reaction (see 
section 3  How to use Empliciti, Medicines given before each infusion ). </p>
<p>Before starting treatment with Empliciti, you must also read the package leaflet warnings and 
precautions of all medicines to be taken in combination with Empliciti for information related to these 
medicines. When lenalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention 
requirements is needed (see  Pregnancy and breast-feeding  in this section). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Empliciti is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Empliciti 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
For women taking Empliciti 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not use Empliciti if you are pregnant, unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The 
effects of Empliciti in pregnant women or its possible harm to an unborn baby are unknown. 
* You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with Empliciti and for 
120 days after stopping treatment, if there is any chance you could become pregnant. 
* If you become pregnant while using Empliciti, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>When Empliciti is given in combination with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, you must follow the 
pregnancy prevention programme for lenalidomide or pomalidomide respectively (see package leaflet 
for lenalidomide or pomalidomide). Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are expected to be harmful 
for an unborn baby. </p>
<p>It is not known, whether elotuzumab passes into breast milk or if there is any risk to the breast-fed 
infant. Elotuzumab will be given in combination with lenalidomide or pomalidomide and 
breast-feeding should be stopped because of the use of lenalidomide or pomalidomide. </p>
<p>For men taking Empliciti 
You should use a condom while taking Empliciti and for 180 days after stopping treatment to ensure 
your partner does not become pregnant. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Empliciti is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you get an 
infusion related reaction (fever, chills, high blood pressure see section 4  Possible side effects ), do 
not drive, cycle or use machines until the reaction stops. </p>
<p>Empliciti contains sodium 
Tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given Empliciti. This 
medicine contains 3.92 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per 300 mg vial or 5.23 mg 
sodium per 400 mg vial. This is equivalent to 0.2% or 0.3% respectively, of the recommended 
maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

You will receive Empliciti under the supervision of an experienced healthcare professional. It will be 
given into a vein (intravenously) as a drip (infusion) over several hours. </p>

* In cycles 1 and 2, once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. * In cycles 3 and beyond, once every 4 weeks on day 1. Your doctor will continue to treat you with Empliciti for as long as the disease improves or remains 
stable and side effects are tolerable. </p>
<p>Medicines given before each infusion

infusion related reactions: 
* medicine to reduce an allergic reaction (an anti-histamine) 
* medicine to reduce inflammation (dexamethasone) 
* medicine to reduce pain and fever (paracetamol) </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Empliciti 
Empliciti is used in combination with other medicines for multiple myeloma. If any medicine in the 
treatment is delayed, interrupted, or discontinued, your doctor will decide how your treatment should 
be continued. </p>
<p>If you are given too much Empliciti 
As Empliciti will be given to you by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely you will be given too 
much. In the unlikely case of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects. </p>

Stopping your treatment with Empliciti may stop the effect of the medicine. Do not stop treatment 
unless you have discussed this with your doctor. </p>
