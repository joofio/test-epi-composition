Emselex reduces the activity of an overactive bladder. This enables you to wait longer before you go 
to the toilet and it increases the amount of urine that your bladder can hold. </p>
<p>What Emselex can be used for 
Emselex belongs to a class of medicines which relax the muscles of the bladder. It is used in adults for 
the treatment of the symptoms of overactive bladder conditions - such as a sudden urge to rush to the 
toilet, needing to go to the toilet frequently and/or not getting to the toilet in time and wetting yourself 
(urge incontinence). </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to darifenacin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* if you suffer from urinary retention (inability to empty your bladder). 
* if you have gastric retention (problems emptying the contents of the stomach). 
* if you suffer from uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma (high pressure in the eyes that is not 
being adequately treated).

muscles). 
* if you have severe ulcerative colitis or toxic megacolon (acute dilation of the colon due to 
complication of infection or inflammation). 
* if you have severe liver problems. 
* if you are taking medicines that strongly decrease the activity of some liver enzymes such as 
ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other 
conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), verapamil (a medicine used to lower 
blood pressure, to correct heart rhythm or to treat angina pectoris), antifungal medicines (e.g. 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) and some antiviral medicines (e.g. ritonavir)  see paragraph 
 Other medicines and Emselex ). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor  before taking Emselex 
* if you have autonomic neuropathy (damage to the nerves that communicate between the brain 
and internal organs, muscles, skin, and blood vessels to regulate vital functions, including the 
heart rate, blood pressure and bowel function)   your doctor will have told you if you have this. 
* if you have a condition where one or more organs in your abdomen has moved up into your 
chest through a hole in your diaphragm, causing you to get heartburn and belch a lot. 
* if you have difficulties in passing urine and a weak stream of urine. 
* if you have severe constipation (less than or equal to 2 bowel movements per week). 
* if you have a digestive motility disorder. 
* if you have an obstructive gastrointestinal disorder (any obstruction of the passage of intestinal 
or gastric contents, such as narrowing of the pylorus, the lower part of the stomach)   your 
doctor will have told you if you have this. 
* if you are taking medicinal products that can cause or worsen inflammation of the oesophagus 
such as oral bisphosphonates (a class of medicinal products that prevent the loss of bone mass 
and are used to treat osteoporosis). 
* if you are receiving treatment for narrow-angle glaucoma. 
* if you have liver problems. 
* if you have urinary tract infection or other kidney problems.<br />
* if you have an overactive muscle that controls the emptying of the bladder which may cause 
accidental passing of urine (a condition called detrusor hyperreflexia)   your doctor will tell you 
if you are suffering from this condition. 
* if you have heart diseases. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Emselex. </p>

<p>Emselex with food and drink 
Eating food has no effect on Emselex. Grapefruit juice may interact with Emselex. Tell your doctor if

<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask

Emselex should be taken with caution while breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Emselex may cause effects such as dizziness, blurred vision, trouble sleeping or drowsiness. If you 
have any of these symptoms whilst taking Emselex, consult your doctor for advice on changing the 
dose or considering an alternative treatment. You should not drive or use machines if you are affected 
by these symptoms. For Emselex, these side effects have been reported to be uncommon (see

too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>How much Emselex to take 
The recommended starting dose, including for patients aged over 65 years, is 7.5 mg daily. Depending 
on your response to Emselex, your doctor may increase your dose to 15 mg daily, two weeks after 
starting therapy. </p>
<p>These doses are suitable for people with mild liver problems or people with kidney problems. </p>
<p>Take Emselex tablets once a day with liquid, at about the same time each day. </p>
<p>The tablet may be taken with or without food. Swallow the tablet whole. Do not chew, split or crush it. </p>
<p>If you take more Emselex than you should 
If you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes 
your tablets, go to your doctor or hospital for advice immediately. When seeking medical advice, 
make sure that you take this leaflet and your remaining tablets with you to show them to the doctor. 
People who have taken an overdose may have dry mouth, constipation, headache, indigestion and 
nasal dryness. Overdose with Emselex may lead to severe symptoms requiring emergency treatment in 
hospital. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Emselex 
If you forget to take Emselex at the usual time, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is the time 
for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Emselex 
Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment with Emselex will last. Do not stop treatment early 
because you do not see an immediate effect. Your bladder will need some time to adapt. Finish the 
course of treatment prescribed by your doctor. If you have not noticed any effect by then, discuss it 
with your doctor. </p>
