tenofovir disoproxil. Both of these active substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to 
treat HIV infection. Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a 
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. However, both are generally known as NRTIs and they 
work by interfering with the normal working of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for 
the virus to reproduce itself.
-
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults.
-
It is also used to treat HIV in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 
35 kg, and who have already been treated with other HIV medicines that are no longer effective 
or have caused side effects.
-
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should always be used combined with other 
medicines to treat HIV infection.
-
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. can be administered in place of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil used separately at the same doses.

Warnings and precautions
While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. to treat HIV
-
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. may affect your kidneys. Before and during 
treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to measure kidney function. Tell your doctor if you 
have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d. should not be given to adolescents with existing kidney problems. If you 
have kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d. or, if you already have HIV, to take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. less frequently. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is not recommended if 
you have severe kidney disease or are on dialysis.
-
Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures.
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone loss was 
seen in clinical studies when patients were treated for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with a boosted protease inhibitor.
Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk in 
adult and paediatric patients are uncertain.
Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis are at a 
higher risk of fractures.
-
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients 
infected with HIV who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are 
treated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. 
If you have hepatitis B or C, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for 
you.
-
Know your hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status before starting Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d.. If you have HBV, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop 
taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., whether or not you also have HIV. It is 
important not to stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. without talking to 
your doctor: see section 3, Do not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d..
-
Talk to your doctor if you are over 65. Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. has not 
been studied in patients over 65 years of age.
-
Talk to your doctor if you are intolerant to lactose (see Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. contains lactose later in this section).
Children and adolescents
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is not for use in children under 12 years of age.
Other medicines and Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. if you are already taking other medicines 
that contain the components of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. (emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil) or any other antiviral medicines that contain tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine 
or adefovir dipivoxil.
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with other medicines that can damage 
your kidneys: it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, 
including
-
aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection)
-
amphotericin B (for fungal infection)
-
foscarnet (for viral infection)
-
ganciclovir (for viral infection)
-
pentamidine (for infections)
-
vancomycin (for bacterial infection)
-
interleukin-2 (to treat cancer)
-
cidofovir (for viral infection)
-
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains)
If you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat HIV, your doctor may 
order blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function.
It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection.
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with other medicines containing 
didanosine (for treatment of HIV infection): Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood 
and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess 
lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes causes death, have been reported when medicines 
containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your doctor will carefully 
consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine.
  Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with food and drink
-
Whenever possible, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. should be taken with food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
If you have taken Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. during your pregnancy, your doctor 
may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In 
children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV 
outweighed the risk of side effects.
-
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.. 
This is because the active substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk.
-
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk.
-
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your 
doctor as soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy while taking 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. contains sodium

is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment. Do not change 
the dose unless your doctor tells you to.
-
Your doctor will prescribe Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with other 
antiretroviral medicines. Please refer to the patient information leaflets of the other 
antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those medicines.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how to prevent getting HIV or prevent spreading
HIV to other people.
If you take more Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. than you should
If you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka 
d.d., contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the tablet bottle with you 
so that you can easily describe what you have taken.
If you forget to take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
It is important not to miss a dose of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d..
-
If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d., take the tablet preferably with food as soon as possible. Then take the next dose at 
your usual time.
-
If you notice 12 hours or more after the time you usually take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d., forget about the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose, preferably with 
food, at your usual time.
If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d., take 
another tablet. You do not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d..
If you stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.
-
Stopping tablets may reduce the effectiveness of the anti-HIV therapy recommended by your 
doctor.
  Do not stop taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. without contacting your 
doctor.
If you have hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Krka d.d. treatment without talking to your doctor first. You may require blood tests for several 
months after stopping treatment. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping 
treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-
threatening.
  Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Possible serious side effects:
-
Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side 
effect. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in 
people with liver disease. The following may be signs of lactic acidosis:
-
deep rapid breathing
-
drowsiness
-
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)
-
stomach pain
  If you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately.
-
Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) 
and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune 
system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after 
anti-HIV treatment is started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in 
the body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present 
with no obvious symptoms.
-
Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines to treat HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as:
-
muscle weakness
-
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body
-
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity
  If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, get medical help 
immediately.
Possible side effects:
Very common side effects
(may affect more than 1 in 10 people)
-
diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea)

Tests may also show:
-
low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to 
infection)
-
increased triglycerides (fatty acids), bile or sugar in the blood
-
liver and pancreas problems
Uncommon side effects
(may affect up to 1 in 100 people)
-
pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas

changes to your urine
Rare side effects
(may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people)
-
Lactic acidosis (see Possible serious side effects)
-
fatty liver
-
yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the 
liver

kidney tubule cells
-
softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures)
-
back pain caused by kidney problems
Damage to kidney tubule cells may be associated with breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones 
(with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in 
potassium or phosphate in the blood.
  If you notice any of the side effects listed above or if any of the side effects get serious, talk to 
your doctor or pharmacist.
The frequency of the following side effects is not known.
-
Bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). Taking this type of medicine for a long 
time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being 
overweight, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of 
osteonecrosis are:
-
joint stiffness
-
joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder)
-
difficulty with movement
  If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.
During treatment for HIV there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. 
This is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the 
HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Other effects in children
-
Children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including
-
darkening of the skin in patches
-
Children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia).
-
This may cause the child to be tired or breathless
  If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
