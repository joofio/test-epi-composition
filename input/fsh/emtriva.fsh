infants aged 4 months and over.  Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules are only suitable for patients who 
weigh at least 33 kg.  Emtriva oral solution is available for people who have difficulty in swallowing 
Emtriva hard capsules. </p>
<p>Emtriva contains the active substance emtricitabine.  This active substance is an antiretroviral 
medicine which is used to treat HIV infection.  Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NRTI) which works by interfering with the normal working of an enzyme (reverse 
transcriptase) that is essential for the HIV virus to reproduce itself.  Emtriva may lower the amount of 
HIV in the blood (viral load).  It may also help to increase the number of T cells called CD4 cells.<br />
Emtriva should always be combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. </p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Emtriva you may still develop 
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to emtricitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p> If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your 
kidneys.  Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess kidney function 
and may advise you to take the capsules less often or prescribe Emtriva oral solution.  Your 
doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor your kidneys. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are over 65.  Emtriva has not been studied in patients over 65 years 
of age.  If you are older than this and are prescribed Emtriva, your doctor will monitor you 
carefully. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a 
higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, 
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you.  If you have a history of 
liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to 
carefully monitor liver function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look out for infections.  If you have advanced HIV disease (AIDS) and another infection, you 
may develop inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of infection when you start treatment 
with Emtriva.  These may be signs that your body’s improved immune system is fighting 
infection.  If you notice signs of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Emtriva, 
tell your doctor at once. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone 
disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).<br />
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many 
risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and 
pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you notice any 
of these symptoms please inform your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give Emtriva to infants under 4 months of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Emtriva </p>
<p>You should not take Emtriva if you are already taking other medicines that contain emtricitabine or 
lamivudine, which are also used to treat HIV infection, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not stop your treatment without contacting your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you have taken Emtriva during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and 
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took 
NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side 
effects. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed if you are taking Emtriva.  This is because the active substance in this medicine 
passes into human breast milk.   </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Emtriva may cause dizziness.  If you experience dizziness while taking Emtriva, do not drive and do 
not use any tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose is: </p>
<ul>
<li>Adults: one 200 mg hard capsule, each day with or without food.  Swallow the hard capsule 
with a glass of water. </li>
<li>Children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who weigh at least 33 kg and who are able to

patients with kidney problems, Emtriva is available as a liquid (an oral solution).  If you have 
difficulty in swallowing the capsules, tell your doctor. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine 
is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not 
change the dose unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have problems with your kidneys, your doctor may advise you to take Emtriva less 
frequently. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your doctor will prescribe Emtriva with other antiretroviral medicines.  Please refer to the 
package leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those medicines. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take more Emtriva than you should </p>
<p>If you accidentally take too many Emtriva hard capsules, contact your doctor or nearest emergency 
department for advice.  Keep the carton with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Emtriva </p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of Emtriva. </p>
<p>If you do miss a dose of Emtriva within 12 hours of when it is usually taken, take it as soon as you 
can, and then take your next dose at its regular time. </p>
<p>If it is almost time (less than 12 hours) for your next dose anyway, forget about the missed dose.<br />
Wait and take the next dose at the regular time.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
hard capsule. </p>
<p>If you are sick (vomit) </p>
<p>If it’s less than an hour since you took Emtriva, take another capsule.  You do not need to take 
another capsule if you were sick more than an hour after taking Emtriva. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Emtriva </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t stop taking Emtriva without talking to your doctor.  Stopping treatment with Emtriva 
may reduce the effectiveness of the anti-HIV therapy recommended by your doctor.  Speak with 
your doctor before you stop, particularly if you are experiencing any side effects or you have 
another illness.  Contact your doctor again before you restart taking Emtriva capsules. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your 
Emtriva treatment without talking to your doctor first.  Some patients have had blood tests or 
symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Emtriva.  You may require 
blood tests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver 
disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of 
hepatitis. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly 
symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. </p>
