combination with other medicines (carrier medicines). </p>
<p>EndolucinBeta is a type of product called a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It contains the active 
substance Lutetium (177Lu) chloride which gives off beta-radiation, allowing a localised radiation 
effect. This radiation is used to treat certain diseases. </p>
<p>EndolucinBeta has to be combined with a carrier medicine in a process called radiolabelling before 
administration. The carrier medicine then takes the EndolucinBeta to the disease site in the body. </p>
<p>These carrier medicines have been specially developed for use with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride and may 
be substances that have been designed to recognise a particular type of cell in the body. </p>
<p>The use of a medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta does involve exposure to radioactivity. Your 
doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain 
from the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. </p>

- if you are allergic to Lutetium (177Lu) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
- if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. </p>
<p>Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta for 
additional information. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
EndolucinBeta is not to be administered directly to patients. 
Take special care with the medicine that is radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta: 
- if you have renal impairment or bone marrow disease. </p>
<p>Treatment with Lutetium (177Lu) may lead to the following side effects: 
- a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia); 
- a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) which are important to stop 
bleeding; 
- a reduced number of white blood cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are 
important for protecting the body against infection. </p>
<p>Most of these events are mild and only temporary. A reduced number of all 3 types of blood cells (red 
blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells - pancytopenia), requiring treatment discontinuation has 
been described in some patients. </p>
<p>Because Lutetium (177Lu) can sometimes affect your blood cells, your doctor will do blood tests before 
you start and at regular intervals during treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience shortness of 
breath, bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding from your gums, or if you develop a fever. </p>
<p>During peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours, radiolabelled somatostatin 
analogues are excreted by the kidneys. Your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your 
kidney function before you start and during treatment. </p>
<p>Treatment with Lutetium (177Lu) may cause disturbances of liver function. Your doctor will take a 
blood test to monitor your liver function during treatment.  </p>
<p>Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicines may be administered directly into your vein through a tube known 
as a cannula. There have been reports of leakage of the fluid into the surrounding tissue 
(extravasation). Tell your doctor if you experience any swelling or pain in your arm. </p>
<p>After neuroendocrine tumours are treated with Lutetium (177Lu), patients may experience symptoms 
associated with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as a carcinoid crisis. Tell your 
doctor if you feel faint or dizzy or experience flushing or diarrhoea following your treatment. </p>
<p>Treatment with Lutetium (177Lu) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, due to the rapid breakdown of 
tumour cells. This may result in abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, kidney failure or 
seizures within a week of treatment. Your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor you for this 
syndrome. Tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or shortness of 
breath. </p>
<p>Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta for 
additional warnings and precautions. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
EndolucinBeta is not to be used directly in childrens and adolescent patients under 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and medicines radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines since they may interfere with the procedure. 
It is not known whether Lutetium (177Lu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific 
studies have not been carried out. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of medicines radiolabelled 
with EndolucinBeta if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or 
if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the 
procedure. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant 
Medicines radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta must not be administered if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding 
You will be asked to stop breast-feeding. 
Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the medicine used in 
combination with EndolucinBeta. Please read the package leaflet of that medicine carefully. </p>         </div>"""

radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta will only be used in special controlled areas. This medicine will 
only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These 
persons will take special care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their 
actions. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of a medicine 
radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to 
achieve the appropriate outcome, depending on the medicine you take with EndolucinBeta and what it 
is used for. </p>
<p>Administration of the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta and conduct of the procedure 
EndolucinBeta must be used only in combination with another medicine (carrier medicine) which has 
been specifically developed and authorised for being combined with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride. The 
administration will depend on the type of the carrier medicine. Please read the Package Leaflet of that 
medicine. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. </p>
<p>After administration of the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta 
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after 
receiving the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you 
have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta than you should 
Since the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta is handled by a nuclear medicine doctor under 
strictly controlled conditions, there is only a very small chance of possible overdose. However, in the 
case of an overdose or an inadvertent intravenous injection of the unlabelled product, you will receive 
appropriate treatment that will remove the radionuclide from the body. </p>
<p>Should you have any further questions on the use of the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta, 
ask your nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""

<p>After the medicine radiolablelled with EndolucinBeta is administered, it will deliver certain amounts 
of ionising radiation (radioactivity) which can induce a certain risk of cancer and development of 
hereditary defects. In all cases, the risk of the radiation is outweighed by the potential benefit of 
receiving the radiolabelled medicine. </p>

radiolabelled. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side

<p>What EndolucinBeta looks like and contents of the pack 
EndolucinBeta is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. It is presented as a clear and colourless 
solution in a colourless type I glass 2 mL or 10 mL vial with a V-shaped and flat bottom, respectively, 
with a bromobutyl stopper, closed with an aluminium seal. 
Each pack contains 1 vial placed into a lead container for protective shielding and packed in a metallic 
can and an outer carton. </p>
<p>The volume of one vial ranges from 0.075 – 3.75 mL solution (corresponding to 3 – 150 GBq at 
activity reference time). The volume depends on the quantity of medicine combined with 
EndolucinBeta required for administration by the nuclear medicine doctor. </p>
