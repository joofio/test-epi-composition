<p>Enhertu is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance trastuzumab deruxtecan. One part of 
the medicine is a monoclonal antibody that attaches specifically to cells that have the protein HER2 on 
their surface (HER2-positive), as some cancer cells do. The other active part of Enhertu is DXd, a 
substance that can kill cancer cells. Once the medicine has attached to HER2-positive cancer cells, the 
DXd enters the cells and kills them. </p>
<p>What Enhertu is used for </p>
<p>Enhertu is used to treat adults who have: 
* HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease) or 
cannot be removed by surgery, and tried one or more other treatments specifically for HER2-
positive breast cancer. 
* HER2-low breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease) or 
cannot be removed by surgery and received prior therapy for metastatic disease, or your disease 
has returned during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy (after surgery). A 
test will be performed to make sure Enhertu is right for you. 
* HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot 
be removed by surgery and who have tried a prior treatment. A test will be performed to make 
sure Enhertu is right for you. 
* HER2-positive stomach cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or to areas near the 
stomach that cannot be removed by surgery and who have also tried another treatment 
specifically for HER2-positive stomach cancer. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to trastuzumab deruxtecan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure if you are allergic, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Enhertu. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Enhertu, or during treatment, if you have: 
* cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other new or worsening breathing problems. These may be 
symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal lung disease called interstitial lung disease. A 
history of lung disease or kidney problems may increase the risk of developing interstitial lung 
disease. Your doctor may have to monitor your lungs while you are taking this medicine. 
* chills, fever, sores in your mouth, stomach pain or pain when urinating. These may be 
symptoms of an infection caused by a reduced number of white blood cells called neutrophils. 
* new or worsening shortness of breath, cough, tiredness, swelling of ankles or legs, irregular 
heartbeat, sudden weight gain, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. These may be symptoms of a 
condition in which your heart cannot pump blood well enough (decreased left ventricular 
ejection fraction). 
* liver problems. Your doctor may have to monitor your liver while you are taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out tests before and during treatment with Enhertu. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Enhertu is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. This is because there is no 
information on how well it works in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Enhertu </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding, contraception and fertility </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pregnancy 
Enhertu is not recommended during pregnancy because this medicine may harm the unborn 
baby. 
Speak with your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to become pregnant before or during treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Enhertu and for at least 7 months after your 
last dose. This is because it is not known whether Enhertu passes into breast milk. Talk to your 
doctor about this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contraception 
Use effective contraception (birth control) to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with 
Enhertu. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Women taking Enhertu should continue contraception for at least 7 months after the last dose of 
Enhertu. </p>
<p>Men taking Enhertu whose partner may become pregnant should use effective contraception:</p>
<ul>
<li>during treatment and </li>
<li>for at least 4 months after the last dose of Enhertu. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the best contraception for you. Also talk to your doctor before you 
stop your contraception. </p>
<ul>
<li>Fertility 
If you are a man being treated with Enhertu, you should not father a child for 4 months after 
treatment and take advice on conserving sperm before treatment because the medicine may 
reduce your fertility. Therefore, discuss this with your doctor before starting treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Enhertu is not likely to reduce your ability to drive or use machines. Be careful if you feel tired, dizzy, 
or have a headache. </p>         </div>"""
