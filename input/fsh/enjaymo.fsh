monoclonal antibodies.<br />
In the rare blood disorder cold agglutinin disease (CAD), certain antibodies of the immune defence 
system bind to red blood cells. This causes breakdown of the red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) 
through activation of classical complement pathway (part of the immune defense system). Enjaymo 
blocks the activation of this part of the immune defence system. <br />
Enjaymo is used to treat haemolytic anaemia in adults who have CAD. This reduces anaemia and 
lessen fatigue.  </p>         </div>"""
