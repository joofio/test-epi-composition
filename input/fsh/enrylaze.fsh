<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you receive Enrylaze. </p>
<p>The following problems may occur during treatment with Enrylaze: 
* serious allergic reactions that may be life threatening. The hospital will ensure they are prepared 
to address any allergic reactions that may occur during treatment. 
* inflammation of your pancreas. Discomfort or pain in your stomach or back area may be a sign 
of pancreatitis and should be reported to your doctor straight away. 
* changes in your body’s ability to manage blood sugar levels. Your doctor should monitor your 
glucose levels whilst on treatment and provide insulin if necessary. 
* unusual bleeding events or blood clots. If either of these events occur treatment will be paused 
by your doctor until they are resolved. 
* issues with your liver. Your doctor will monitor you to identify if you are experiencing any 
issues with your liver and treat you as necessary.<br />
* central nervous system toxicity, such as seizures and impaired neurological function. Also, 
instances of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (characterised by headache, 
confusion, seizures and loss of vision) may require blood-pressure lowering medicines and in 
case of seizure, treatment with anti-epileptic medicines. </p>
<p>Monitoring during treatment with Enrylaze 
You will be monitored during and after treatment with Enrylaze for: 
* allergic reactions 
* functioning of your pancreas and liver 
* blood sugar levels </p>
<p>Other medicines and Enrylaze 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have or are receiving: 
* methotrexate or cytarabine, used in cancer treatment. Use of these medicines immediately 
before Enrylaze may increase their effect. 
* vincristine, used in cancer treatment. Use of vincristine with Enrylaze may increase the toxicity 
of vincristine. 
* glucocorticoids, used as anti-inflammation medicines. Use of these medicines immediately 
before Enrylaze may increase the formation of blood clots.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Enrylaze should not be used during pregnancy, and women should check they are not pregnant prior to 
starting therapy. If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, ask your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice before receiving this medicine. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed during treatment and for two weeks following treatment with Enrylaze, as 
there may be a risk to the breast-feeding child. </p>
<p>Family planning 
Both men and women should use a form of contraception and avoid conceiving a child during 
treatment with Enrylaze and for 3 months after you last receive Enrylaze. Hormonal contraceptives are 
not recommended for use in women when being treated with Enrylaze. </p>
<p>Women should undergo pregnancy testing before starting treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Enrylaze can cause you to feel sick and have a headache. This may impact your ability to drive and 
operate machines. </p>
<p>Enrylaze contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose unit, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free’. </p>         </div>"""
