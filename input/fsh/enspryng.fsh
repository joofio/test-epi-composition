<p>Enspryng contains the active substance satralizumab. It is a type of protein called a monoclonal 
antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are designed to recognise and attach to a specific substance in the 
body. </p>
<p>What Enspryng is used for </p>
<p>Enspryng is a medicine for treating neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in adults and 
young people from 12 years of age. </p>
<p>What is NMOSD  </p>
<p>NMOSD is a disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. 
It is caused by the immune system (the body’s defences) working incorrectly and attacking nerves in 
the body. 
* The damage to the optic nerves causes swelling, leading to pain and loss of sight. 
* The damage to the spinal cord causes weakness or loss of movement in the legs or arms, loss of 
feeling, and problems with bladder and bowel function. </p>
<p>In an attack of NMOSD, there is swelling in the nervous system. This also happens when the disease 
comes back (relapse). The swelling causes new symptoms or a return of previous symptoms. </p>
<p>How Enspryng works </p>
<p>Enspryng blocks the action of a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is involved in the processes 
that lead to damage and swelling in the nervous system. By blocking its effects, Enspryng reduces the 
risk of a relapse or attack of NMOSD. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to satralizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>If the above applies to you or you are not sure, do not use Enspryng and talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor immediately if you experience any allergic reaction (see section 4. Possible side 
effects). </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Enspryng if any of the below apply to you (or if 
you are not sure). </p>
<p>Infections </p>
<p>You cannot use Enspryng while you have an infection. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if 
you think you have any signs of infection before, during, or after Enspryng treatment such as:<br />
* fever or chills 
* cough that does not go away 
* sore throat 
* cold sore or genital sores (herpes simplex) 
* shingles (herpes zoster) 
* skin redness, swelling, tenderness or pain 
* feeling or being sick, diarrhoea or belly pain. </p>
<p>You will also find this information in the patient alert card you have been given by your doctor. It is 
important that you keep this alert card with you at all times and show it to any doctor, nurse or 
caregiver. </p>
<p>Your doctor will wait until the infection is controlled before giving you Enspryng or allowing you to 
continue to inject Enspryng. </p>
<p>Vaccinations </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have recently been given any vaccine or might be given a vaccine in the 
near future. 
* Your doctor will check if you need any vaccines before you start Enspryng. 
* Do not have live or live attenuated vaccines (for example BCG for tuberculosis or vaccines 
against yellow fever) while you are being treated with Enspryng. </p>
<p>Liver enzymes </p>
<p>Enspryng can have effects on your liver and increase the amount of some liver enzymes in your blood. 
Your doctor will do blood tests before you are given Enspryng, and during your treatment, to check 
how well your liver is working. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any of these 
signs of liver damage during or after Enspryng treatment:<br />
* yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) 
* dark-coloured urine 
* feeling and being sick 
* abdominal pain </p>
<p>White blood cell count </p>
<p>Your doctor will perform blood tests before you are given Enspryng, and during your treatment, to 
check your white blood cell count. </p>
<p>Children and young people </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age. This is because it has not yet been studied 
in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Enspryng </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines such as warfarin, carbamazepine, phenytoin 
and theophylline as doses might need to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Your doctor may advise you to stop breast-feeding if you are to be given Enspryng. It is not known 
whether Enspryng passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Enspryng is not likely to affect you being able to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How much Enspryng to use </p>
<p>Each injection contains 120 mg of satralizumab. The first injection will be given under the supervision 
of your doctor or nurse. 
* The first three injections are given once every 2 weeks. These are called ‘loading doses’.<br />
* After this, the injection is given every 4 weeks. This is called the ‘maintenance dose’. Continue 
with the injections once every 4 weeks for as long as your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>How to use Enspryng </p>
<ul>
<li>Enspryng is given by injection under the skin (sub-cutaneously).  </li>
<li>Inject the entire content of the syringe each time. </li>
</ul>
<p>At the start, your doctor or nurse may inject Enspryng. However, your doctor may decide that you or 
an adult caregiver can inject Enspryng.<br />
<em> You or your caregiver will get training on how to inject Enspryng.<br />
</em> Talk to your doctor or nurse if you or your caregiver have any questions about giving injections.  </p>
<p>Read carefully and follow the “Instructions for use” at the end of this leaflet on how to inject 
Enspryng. </p>
<p>If you use more Enspryng than you should </p>
<p>Because Enspryng is in a pre-filled syringe, it is unlikely that you will receive too much. However, if 
you are worried, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>If you accidentally inject more doses than you should, call your doctor. Always take the outer carton 
with you when you go to see the doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Enspryng </p>
<p>For the treatment to be fully effective, it is very important to keep having the injections.  </p>
<p>If your doctor or nurse is giving your injections and you miss an appointment, make another one 
straight away.  </p>
<p>If you are injecting Enspryng yourself and you miss an injection, inject it as soon as possible. Do not 
wait until the next planned dose. After you have had the injection for the missed dose, your next 
injection should be either: 
* for loading doses – 2 weeks later 
* for maintenance doses – 4 weeks later </p>
<p>Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>If you stop using Enspryng </p>
<p>Do not suddenly stop using Enspryng without asking your doctor first. If you have any further 
questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
