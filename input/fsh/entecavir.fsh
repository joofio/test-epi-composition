<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Entecavir Viatris<br />
* if you have ever had problems with your kidneys, tell your doctor. This is important because 
Entecavir Viatris is eliminated from your body through the kidneys and your dose or dosing 
schedule may need to be adjusted.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>do not stop taking Entecavir Viatris without your doctor s advice since your hepatitis may 
worsen after stopping treatment. When your treatment with Entecavir Viatris is stopped, your 
doctor will continue to monitor you and take blood tests for several months.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discuss with your doctor whether your liver functions properly and, if not, what the possible 
effects on your Entecavir Viatris treatment may be.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are also infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) be sure to tell your doctor. 
You should not take Entecavir Viatris to treat your hepatitis B infection unless you are taking 
medicines for HIV at the same time, as the effectiveness of future HIV treatment may be 
reduced. Entecavir Viatris will not control your HIV infection.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taking Entecavir Viatris will not stop you from infecting other people with hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) through sexual contact or body fluids (including blood contamination). So, it is 
important to take appropriate precautions to prevent others from becoming infected with HBV. 
A vaccine is available to protect those at risk from becoming infected with HBV.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entecavir Viatris belongs to a class of medicines that can cause lactic acidosis (excess of 
lactic acid in your blood) and enlargement of the liver. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and 
stomach pain might indicate the development of lactic acidosis. This rare but serious side effect 
has occasionally been fatal. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are 
very overweight. Your doctor will monitor you regularly while you are receiving Entecavir 
Viatris.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have previously received treatment for chronic hepatitis B, please inform your doctor.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Entecavir Viatris should not be used for children below 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Entecavir Viatris<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Entecavir Viatris with food and drink<br />
In most cases you may take Entecavir Viatris with or without food. However, if you have had a 
previous treatment with a medicine containing the active substance lamivudine you should consider 
the following. If you were switched over to Entecavir Viatris because the treatment with lamivudine 
was not successful, you should take Entecavir Viatris on an empty stomach once daily. If your liver 
disease is very advanced, your doctor will also instruct you to take Entecavir Viatris on an empty 
stomach. Empty stomach means at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next 
meal.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age) can take Entecavir Viatris with or 
without food.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It has not been demonstrated that 
entecavir is safe to use during pregnancy. Entecavir Viatris must not be used during pregnancy unless 
specifically directed by your doctor. It is important that women of childbearing age receiving 
treatment with Entecavir Viatris use an effective method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant.  </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed during treatment with Entecavir Viatris. Tell your doctor if you are 
breastfeeding. It is not known whether entecavir, the active substance in Entecavir Viatris, is excreted 
in human breast milk.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Dizziness, tiredness (fatigue) and sleepiness (somnolence) are common side effects which may impair 
your ability to drive and use machines. If you have any concerns consult your doctor.  </p>
<p>Entecavir Viatris contains lactose<br />
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.   </p>
<p>For adults the recommended dose is either 0.5 mg or 1 mg once daily orally (by mouth).  </p>
<p>Your dose will depend on:<br />
<em> whether you have been treated for HBV infection before, and what medicine you received.<br />
</em> whether you have kidney problems. Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose for you or instruct 
you to take it less often than once a day.<br />
* the condition of your liver.  </p>
<p>For children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the 
right dose based on your child's weight. Children weighing at least 32.6 kg may take the 0.5 mg tablet 
or an entecavir oral solution may be available. For patients weighing from 10 kg to 32.5 kg, an 
entecavir oral solution is recommended. All doses should be taken once daily orally (by mouth). There 
are no recommendations for entecavir in children less than 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg.  </p>
<p>For children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age), Entecavir Viatris 0.5 mg Film-
coated Tablets are available or an oral solution may be available. Your child s doctor will decide the 
right dose based on your child s weight. </p>
<p>Your doctor will advise you on the dose that is right for you.<br />
Always take the dose recommended by your doctor to ensure that your medicine is fully effective and 
to reduce the development of resistance to treatment. Take Entecavir Viatris as long as your doctor has 
told you. Your doctor will tell you if and when you should stop the treatment.  </p>
<p>Some patients must take Entecavir Viatris on an empty stomach (see Entecavir Viatris with food and 
drink in Section 2). If your doctor instructs you to take Entecavir Viatris on an empty stomach, empty 
stomach means at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next meal.  </p>
<p>If you take more Entecavir Viatris than you should<br />
Contact your doctor at once.  </p>
<p>If you forget to take Entecavir Viatris<br />
It is important that you do not miss any doses. If you miss a dose of Entecavir Viatris, take it as soon 
as possible, and then take your next scheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next 
dose, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  </p>
<p>Do not stop Entecavir Viatris without your doctor s advice<br />
Some people get very serious hepatitis symptoms when they stop taking entecavir. Tell your doctor 
immediately about any changes in symptoms that you notice after stopping treatment.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
