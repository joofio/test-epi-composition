more insulin and thereby lower your blood sugar (glucose).
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the sugar 
in your blood or where your body does not respond normally to the insulin it produces.
Enyglid is used to control type 2 diabetes in adults as an add-on to diet and exercise: treatment is 
usually started if diet, exercise and weight reduction alone have not been able to control (or lower) 
your blood sugar.
Enyglid can also be given with metformin, another medicine for diabetes.
Enyglid has been shown to lower the blood sugar, which helps to prevent complications from your 
diabetes.</p>         </div>"""

death.
If you have a hypo that makes you pass out, or a lot of hypos, talk to your doctor. The amount of 
Enyglid, food or exercise may need to be adjusted.

<p>if you exercise less than usual.
