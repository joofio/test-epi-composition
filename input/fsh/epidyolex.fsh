- if you are allergic to cannabidiol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if your doctor determines that you have certain abnormal liver blood tests. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Epidyolex or during treatment if: 
- you have or have had liver problems, as your doctor may need to change the dose of Epidyolex 
or may decide that Epidyolex is not appropriate for you. 
Your doctor may do blood tests to check your liver before you start taking this medicine and 
during treatment, as Epidyolex can cause liver problems. If your liver is not working properly, 
your treatment may need to be stopped. 
- you notice unusual changes in your mood or behaviour or have thoughts of harming or killing 
yourself. Contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away (See section 4). 
- Epidyolex can make you feel sleepy. Do not drive, operate machinery, or take part in activities 
that require you to be alert and have fine control, such as cycling, until you know how 
Epidyolex affects you. 
- you stop taking Epidyolex suddenly. 
- your seizures happen more often, or if you experience a severe seizure while taking Epidyolex. 
Contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. 
- you experience weight loss or are unable to gain weight. Your doctor will monitor your weight 
and will evaluate if Epidyolex treatment should be continued. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Epidyolex is not recommended for use in children under the age of 2 years.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Epidyolex 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Taking Epidyolex with certain other medicines may cause side effects, affect how the other 
medicines work, or affect how Epidyolex works. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking 
to your doctor or pharmacist. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines, as your dose may need to be 
adjusted: 
- other epilepsy medicines, such as carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine, lorazepam, phenytoin, 
stiripentol and valproate, that are used to treat seizures 
- other medicines used to treat TSC, including everolimus or tacrolimus 
- medicines used to treat acid reflux (heartburn or acid regurgitation) such as omeprazole 
- mitotane (a medicine used to treat tumours in the adrenal gland) 
- morphine or diflunisal (medicines used to treat pain) 
- efavirenz (a medicine used to treat HIV/AIDS) 
- theophylline (a medicine used to treat asthma) 
- caffeine (a medicine for babies who need help breathing) 
- propofol (an anaesthetic used for people undergoing surgery) 
- simvastatin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, (medicines used to reduce cholesterol/lipids) 
- enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer) 
- bupropion (a medicine to help stop smoking or for treating obesity) 
- St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety) 
- medicines to treat bacterial infections, such as rifampin, clarithromycin and erythromycin </p>
<p>Epidyolex with food 
Always take Epidyolex according to your doctor’s instructions and consistently either with or without 
food, including high-fat meals (such as ketogenic diet). If you take Epidyolex with food, a similar 
meal type (e.g., similar fat content) should be taken if possible. (See also section 3, How to take 
Epidyolex). </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should not take Epidyolex while you are 
pregnant unless the doctor decides the benefits outweigh the potential risks. 
You should not breast-feed whilst taking Epidyolex, as Epidyolex is likely to be present in breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Talk to your doctor about driving, using machines or when children undertake activities such as 
cycling or other sports, because you may feel sleepy after taking this medicine. 
You should not drive, use machines or take part in activities that require you to be alert and have fine 
control, until it is established that your ability to perform such activities is not affected.  </p>
<p>Epidyolex contains sesame oil, alcohol (ethanol), strawberry flavour components (including 
benzyl alcohol). 
Epidyolex contains refined sesame oil which may rarely cause severe allergic reactions. </p>
<p>Each ml of Epidyolex contains 79 mg of ethanol equivalent to 10% v/v anhydrous ethanol, i.e., up to 
691.3 mg ethanol per maximal single Epidyolex dose (12.5 mg/kg) for an adult weighing 70 kg 
(9.9 mg ethanol/kg). For an adult weighing 70 kg, this is equivalent to 17 millilitres (ml) of beer, or 
7 ml of wine per dose.  </p>
<p>This medicine contains 0.0003 mg/ml benzyl alcohol corresponding 0.0026 mg per maximal 
Epidyolex dose (Epidyolex 12.5 mg/kg per dose for an adult weighing 70 kg). 
Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Epidyolex is an oral solution (a liquid to be swallowed). Your doctor and pharmacist will tell you how 
much (number of ml) Epidyolex to take each day, how many times a day you should take it and which 
syringe you should use for your dose (1 ml or 5 ml). </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate the dose according to your body weight. You may start on a low dose that 
your doctor gradually increases over time. Contact your doctor if you are unsure of your dose or if you 
think your dose may need to be changed. </p>
<p>Taking Epidyolex with food can increase the amount of medicine your body takes in. You should try, 
as far as possible, to take Epidyolex consistently either with or without food, and according to your 
daily routine, so you get the same effect each time. If you take Epidyolex with food, a similar meal 
type (e.g., similar fat content) should be taken if possible. </p>
<p>If necessary, Epidyolex may be taken via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube. Your doctor will give you 
directions how to do so. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have liver problems because the doctor may need to adjust the dose. </p>
<p>Do not reduce the dose or stop this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. </p>
