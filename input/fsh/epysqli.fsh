Epysqli contains the active substance eculizumab and it belongs to a class of medicines called 
monoclonal antibodies. Eculizumab binds to and inhibits a specific protein in the body that causes 
inflammation and so prevents your body s systems from attacking and destroying vulnerable blood 
cells, kidneys, muscles or eye nerves and spinal cord. </p>
<p>What is Epysqli used for 
Epysqli is used to treat adults and children patients with a certain type of disease affecting the blood 
system called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH). In patients with PNH, their red blood 
cells can be destroyed which can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in 
functioning, pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. Eculizumab can block the body s 
inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable PNH blood cells. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to eculizumab, proteins derived from mouse products, other monoclonal 
antibodies, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
- If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless you take antibiotics to 
reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated . 
- If you have a meningococcal infection. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections alert 
Epysqli treatment may reduce your natural resistance to infections, especially against certain 
organisms that cause meningococcal infection (severe infection of the linings of the brain and sepsis) 
and other Neisseria infections including disseminated gonorrhea. </p>
<p>Consult your doctor before you take Epysqli to be sure that you receive vaccination against Neisseria 
meningitidis, an organism that causes meningococcal infection, at least 2 weeks before beginning 
therapy, or that you take antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been 
vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should also be 
aware that vaccination may not prevent this type of infection. In accordance with national 
recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to prevent 
infection. </p>
<p>If you are at risk of gonorrhoea, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>Meningococcal infection symptoms </p>
<p>Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating certain types of infection in patients who 
receive Epysqli, you will be provided a card to carry with you, listing specific trigger symptoms. This 
card is named:  Patient Safety Card . </p>
<p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>headache with nausea or vomiting </li>
<li>headache with a stiff neck or back </li>
<li>fever </li>
<li>rash </li>
<li>confusion </li>
<li>severe muscle aches combined with flu-like symptoms </li>
<li>sensitivity to light </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling </p>
<p>If you are travelling in a remote region where you are unable to contact your doctor or in which you 
find yourself temporarily unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor can make arrangements to 
issue, as a preventive measure, a prescription for an antibiotic to counter Neisseria meningitidis that 
you keep with you. If you experience any of the symptoms amongst those cited above, you should take 
the antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should see a doctor as soon as possible, 
even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. </p>
<p>Infections 
Before starting Epysqli, inform your doctor if you have any infections. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
Epysqli contains a protein and proteins can cause allergic reactions in some people. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections </p>
<p>Elderly 
There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Epysqli 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>

considered in women who are able to get pregnant. </p>

your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines

<p>Epysqli contains sodium 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
0.35 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 180 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 17.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You 
should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>
<p>Once diluted with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45 %) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
0.19 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 180 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 9.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You 
should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

meningococcal infection if it was not previously administered or if your vaccination is outdated. If 
your child is below the age of vaccination or if you are not vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start 
treatment with Epysqli, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 
weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
Your doctor will administer a vaccine to your child aged less than 18 years against Haemophilus 
influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination recommendations for 
each age group. </p>
<p>Instructions for proper use 
The treatment will be given by your doctor or other health care provider by infusing a dilution of the 
Epysqli vial from a drip bag through a tube directly into one of your veins. It is recommended that the 
beginning of your treatments, called the initial phase, will extend over 4 weeks, followed by a 
maintenance phase. </p>
<p>For adults </p>
<p>Initial Phase: 
Every week for the first four weeks, your doctor will administer an intravenous infusion of diluted 
Epysqli. Each infusion will consist of a dose of 600 mg (2 vials of 30 ml) and will take 25   minutes (35 minutes   10 minutes). </p>
<p>Maintenance Phase: 
  In the fifth week, your doctor will administer an intravenous infusion of diluted Epysqli at 
a dose of 900 mg (3 vials of 30 ml) over a 25   45 minute (35 minutes   10 minutes) 
period. 
  After the fifth week, your doctor will administer 900 mg of diluted Epysqli every two 
weeks as a long-term treatment. </p>
<p>For children and adolescents </p>
<p>Children and adolescents who are 40 kg weight and over are treated with the adult dosing. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents who are under 40 kg weight require a lower dose based on how much they 
weigh. Your doctor will calculate this. </p>
<p>For children and adolescents aged less than 18 years: 
Body Weight 
Initial Phase 
Maintenance Phase 
30 to &lt; 40 kg 
600 mg weekly for 
the first 2 weeks 
900 mg at week 3; then 900 mg every 2 weeks 
20 to &lt; 30 kg 
600 mg weekly for 
the first 2 weeks

5 to &lt; 10 kg

300 mg at week 2; then 300 mg every 3 weeks </p>
<p>Following each infusion, you will be monitored for about one hour. Your doctor s instructions should 
be carefully observed. </p>

If you forget an appointment, please contact your doctor immediately for advice and see section below 
 If you stop using Epysqli . </p>
<p>If you stop using Epysqli for PNH 
Interrupting or ending treatment with Epysqli may cause your PNH symptoms to come back more 
severely soon. Your doctor will discuss the possible side effects with you and explain the risks. Your 
doctor will want to monitor you closely for at least 8 weeks. </p>
<p>The risks of stopping Epysqli include an increase in the destruction of your red blood cells, which may 
cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>A significant fall in your red blood cell counts (anaemia), </li>
<li>Confusion or change in how alert you are, </li>
<li>Chest pain, or angina, </li>
<li>An increase in your serum creatinine level (problems with your kidneys), or </li>
