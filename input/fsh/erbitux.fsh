<p>Erbitux contains cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that 
specifically recognise and bind to other unique proteins called antigens. Cetuximab binds to the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an antigen on the surface of certain cancer cells. EGFR 
activates proteins called RAS. RAS proteins play an important role in the EGFR pathway   a complex 
signalling cascade which is involved in the development and progression of cancer. As a result of this 
binding, the cancer cell can no longer receive the messages it needs for growth, progression and 
metastasis. </p>
<p>What Erbitux is used for </p>
<p>Erbitux is used to treat two different types of cancer: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>metastatic cancer of the large intestine. In these patients, Erbitux is used alone or in combination 
with other anticancer medicines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a certain type of cancer of the head and neck (squamous cell cancer). In these patients, Erbitux 
is used in combination with radiation therapy or with other anticancer medicines. </p>

<p>Do not use Erbitux if you have ever had a severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to cetuximab. </p>
<p>Before starting treatment for metastatic cancer of the large intestine your doctor will test your cancer 
cells if they contain the normal (wild-type) or mutant form of RAS. You must not receive Erbitux in 
combination with other anticancer treatment containing oxaliplatin if your cancer cells contain the 
mutant form of RAS. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Erbitux, if any of the following information is not clear. </p>
<p>Erbitux may cause infusion-related side effects. Such reactions may be allergic in nature. Please read 
'Infusion-related side effects' in section 4 for details, as they may have serious consequences for you, 
including life-threatening conditions. These side effects normally occur during the infusion, within 
1 hour afterwards, or sometimes also after this period. To recognise early signs of such effects, your 
condition will be checked regularly while you receive each infusion of Erbitux and for at least 1 hour 
afterwards. 
You are more likely to experience severe allergic reactions if you are allergic to red meat, tick bites or 
had positive results for certain antibodies (seen in a test). Your doctor will discuss appropriate 
measures with you. </p>
<p>Erbitux may cause side effects concerning the skin. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you 
may need any preventive measures or early treatment. Please also read 'Side effects concerning the 
skin' in section 4 for details, as some skin reactions may have serious consequences for you, including 
life-threatening conditions. </p>
<p>If you have heart problems, your doctor will discuss with you whether you can receive Erbitux in 
combination with other anticancer medicines, especially if you are 65 years of age or older. 
Erbitux may cause side effects concerning the eyes. Please tell your doctor, if you have acute or 
worsening eye problems such as blurred vision, eye pain, red eyes and/or severe dry eye, if you have 
had such problems in the past or if you use contact lenses. Your doctor will discuss with you whether 
you need to consult a specialist. </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux in combination with anticancer medicines including platinum, it is more likely 
that your white blood cell count may be reduced. Your doctor will therefore monitor your blood and 
general condition for signs of infection (see also 'Side effects in combination with other anticancer 
treatments' in section 4). </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, including fluoropyrimidines, it 
may be more likely that you experience heart problems which may be life-threatening. Your doctor 
will discuss with you whether you may need any particular supervision (see also 'Side effects in 
combination with other anticancer treatments' in section 4). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents  </p>
<p>There is no relevant use of Erbitux in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Erbitux </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you are not using reliable contraception (speak to your doctor 
if you are not sure). Your doctor will then discuss with you the risks and benefits of using Erbitux in 
these situations. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed your baby during the period over which you are being treated with Erbitux and for 
two months after the last dose. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you experience treatment-related symptoms that affect 
your ability to concentrate and react. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>A doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines will supervise your Erbitux therapy. During 
each infusion and for at least 1 hour afterwards, your condition will be checked regularly for early 
signs of a possible infusion-related side effect. </p>
<p>Pre-treatment </p>
<p>Before the first dose, you will receive an antiallergic medicine in order to reduce the risk of an allergic 
reaction. Your doctor will decide whether such pre-treatment is necessary for subsequent doses. </p>
<p>Dosage and administration </p>
<p>Erbitux is usually infused into a vein (given as a drip) once a week. Your doctor will calculate the 
correct dose of Erbitux for you because it depends on your body surface area. The first dose 
(400 mg/m  body surface area) is infused over a period of approximately 2 hours with an infusion rate 
not faster than 5 mg/min. Each subsequent dose (250 mg/m  body surface area) is infused in 
approximately 1 hour with an infusion rate not faster than 10 mg/min. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions for your doctor or your nurse on how to prepare the Erbitux infusion are included 
at the end of this package leaflet (see 'Handling instructions'). </p>
<p>Duration of treatment </p>
<p>Erbitux is usually infused once a week. The duration of treatment may vary depending on your disease 
as well as from person to person and your doctor will therefore discuss with you how long you will 
receive Erbitux. </p>
<p>Combination with other anticancer treatments </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, these medicines must be 
administered at least 1 hour after the end of the Erbitux infusion. </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux in combination with radiation therapy, treatment with Erbitux is usually started 
one week before radiation therapy. </p>

<p>The main side effects of Erbitux are infusion-related side effects and side effects concerning the skin: </p>
<p>Infusion-related side effects </p>
<p>More than 10 out of 100 patients are likely to experience infusion-related side effects; in more than 1 
out of 100 patients these side effects are likely to be severe. Such reactions may be allergic in nature. 
They normally occur during the infusion, within 1 hour afterwards, or sometimes also after this period. </p>
<p>Mild or moderate infusion-related side effects include: 
* fever 
* chills 
* dizziness 
* breathing difficulties<br />
If such symptoms occur, please inform your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor may consider 
reducing the infusion rate of Erbitux to manage these symptoms. </p>
<p>Severe infusion-related side effects include: 
* severe breathing difficulties which develop rapidly 
* hives 
* fainting 
* chest pain (a symptom of side effects on your heart) 
If such symptoms occur, speak to a doctor immediately. These side effects may have serious 
consequences, in rare cases including life-threatening conditions, and require immediate attention. 
Treatment with Erbitux must then be stopped. </p>
<p>Side effects concerning the skin </p>
<p>More than 80 out of 100 patients are likely to experience side effects involving the skin. In about out of 100 patients these skin reactions are likely to be severe. Most of these side effects develop 
within the first three weeks of treatment. They usually disappear over time after the end of Erbitux 
therapy. </p>
<p>Main side effects concerning the skin include: 
* acne-like skin alterations 
* itching 
* dry skin 
* scaling 
* excessive growth of hair 
* nail disorders, for example inflammation of the nail bed  </p>
<p>In very rare cases (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) patients may experience blistering or peeling 
of the skin, which may indicate a severe skin reaction called  Stevens-Johnson syndrome . If you 
experience these symptoms, please speak to a doctor immediately, because these signs may have 
serious consequences including life-threatening conditions. </p>
<p>If you notice other extensive skin alterations, please inform your doctor as soon as possible 
because the Erbitux dose or the time between infusions may need to be changed. Your doctor will 
decide whether treatment has to be stopped if skin reactions reappear after several dose reductions. </p>
<p>If you notice that already affected areas of your skin get worse, speak to a doctor immediately, 
especially if you also experience general signs of infection such as fever and tiredness. These signs 
may indicate a skin infection, which may have serious consequences including life-threatening 
conditions. </p>
<p>Side effects concerning the lungs </p>
<p>In uncommon cases (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) patients may experience an inflammation of the 
lungs (called interstitial lung disease), which may have serious consequences including life-
threatening conditions. </p>
<p>If you notice symptoms such as occurrence or worsening of breathing difficulties, speak to a 
doctor immediately, especially if you also experience cough or fever. Your doctor will decide 
whether treatment has to be stopped. </p>
<p>Other side effects </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
* inflammation of the lining of the intestine, mouth, and nose (in some cases severe), which may

<p>Side effects in combination with other anticancer treatments </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, some of the side effects you 
may experience can also be related to the combination or the other medicines. Therefore, please make 
sure that you also read the package leaflet for the other medicines. </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux in combination with anticancer medicines including platinum, it is more likely 
that your white blood cell count may be reduced. This may lead to infectious complications including 
life-threatening conditions, especially if you experience skin reactions, inflammation of the lining of 
the intestine and mouth or diarrhoea. Therefore, if you experience general signs of infection such as 
fever and tiredness, please speak to a doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux in combination with an anticancer medicine containing fluoropyrimidines, it is 
more likely that you experience the following side effects of this other medicine: 
* chest pain 
* heart attack 
* heart failure 
* redness and swelling of the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet which may cause the skin 
to peel (hand-foot syndrome) </p>
<p>If you receive Erbitux with radiation therapy, some of the side effects you may experience can also be 
related to this combination, such as: 
* inflammation of the lining of the intestine and mouth 
* skin reactions typical for radiation therapy 
* difficulty in swallowing<br />
* reduction in the number of white blood cells </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this
