  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Erelzi is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein in 
the body that causes inflammation. Erelzi works by reducing the inflammation associated with certain 
diseases.
In adults (aged 18 and over), Erelzi can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic 
arthritis, severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate or severe 
psoriasis   in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are 
not suitable for you.
For rheumatoid arthritis, Erelzi is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may 
also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in 
combination with methotrexate, Erelzi can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the 
rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities.
For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, Erelzi can improve your ability to do 
normal daily activities. 
For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), Erelzi 
can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease.
Erelzi is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents:</p>
<p>For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not 
worked well enough or is not suitable for them:</p>
<p>Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients 
from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more.</p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more.</p>
<p>For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more 
when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them.</p>
<p>Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who have had 
an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients 
of Erelzi (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest 
tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Erelzi, and contact your doctor 
immediately.</p>
<p>if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If 
you are not sure, please contact your doctor.</p>
<p>if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using Erelzi.</p>
<p>Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, 
wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Erelzi, and contact your doctor immediately.</p>
<p>Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major 
surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with Erelzi.</p>
<p>Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or 
suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection.</p>
<p>Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you 
or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor 
immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of 
infections after you or the child stop using Erelzi.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Erelzi, your 
doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Erelzi. This may include 
a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests should 
be recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you or the child 
have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. 
If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or 
any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor 
should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with 
Erelzi. Treatment with Erelzi may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have 
previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using Erelzi.</p>
<p>Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to 
monitor the treatment with Erelzi in case the infection worsens.</p>
<p>Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or 
symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms 
may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require 
discontinuation of Erelzi.</p>
<p>Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, 
optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of the 
spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if Erelzi is an appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart 
failure, because Erelzi needs to be used with caution under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any 
other cancer before you are given Erelzi.
Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at 
higher than average risk of developing lymphoma.
Children and adults taking Erelzi may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another 
cancer.
Some children and teenage patients who have received Erelzi or other medicines that work the 
same way as Erelzi have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted 
in death.
Some patients receiving Erelzi have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child 
develop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin.</p>
<p>Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using Erelzi. 
Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate.</p>
<p>Alcohol abuse: Erelzi should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. 
Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Wegener s granulomatosis: Erelzi is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener s 
granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener s 
granulomatosis, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking 
medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic 
medicine while using Erelzi.
Children and adolescents
Erelzi is not indicated for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg.</p>
<p>Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Erelzi. 
Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using Erelzi. Please consult 
your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines.
Erelzi should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below the 
age of 2 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic 
arthritis below the age of 12 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with psoriasis below the 
age of 6 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg.
Other medicines and Erelzi
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor. 
You or the child should not use Erelzi with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or 
abatacept.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Erelzi should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if you 
become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.
If you received Erelzi during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. In 
addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, 
compared with mothers who had not received etanercept or other similar medicines (TNF-antagonists), 
but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no increased risk of birth 
defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will help you to decide 
whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. 
Talk to your doctor if you want to breastfeed while on Erelzi treatment. It is important that you tell
your baby s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Erelzi during pregnancy and
breastfeeding before your baby receives any vaccine..
Driving and using machines
The use of Erelzi is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines.
Erelzi contains sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 25 mg or 50 mg, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

Erelzi is available as 25 mg strength and 50 mg strength. 
Use in adult patients (aged 18 years or over)
Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis

your response. If Erelzi has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop 
using this medicine.
Use in children and adolescents
The appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight 
and disease. Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate 
strength of etanercept. Paediatric patients weighing 62.5 kg or more can be dosed 25 mg given twice a 
week or 50 mg given once a week using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen.

Method and route of administration
Erelzi is administered by an injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection).
Detailed instructions on how to inject Erelzi are provided in section 7,  Instructions for use of the 
Erelzi pre-filled syringe . 
Do not mix the Erelzi solution with any other medicine.
To help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week Erelzi should be 
used.
If you use more Erelzi than you should
If you have used more Erelzi than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or by 
using it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer carton of 
the medicine with you, even if it is empty.
If you forget to inject Erelzi
If you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is the 
next day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on the 
usual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a double 
dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Erelzi
Your symptoms may return upon discontinuation.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

period of up to four weeks; after which, it should not be refrigerated again. Erelzi should be discarded if 
not used within four weeks after removal from the refrigerator. It is recommended that you record the 
date that Erelzi is removed from the refrigerator and the date after which Erelzi should be discarded (no 
more than 4 weeks following the removal from the refrigerator).
Inspect the solution in the syringe. It should be clear or slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly 
yellowish, and may contain small white or almost translucent particles of protein. This appearance is 
normal for Erelzi. Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those
