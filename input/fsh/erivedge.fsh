  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Erivedge is 
Erivedge is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance vismodegib.  </p>
<p>What Erivedge is used for 
Erivedge is used to treat adults with a type of skin cancer called advanced basal cell carcinoma. It is 
used when the cancer: 
* has spread to other parts of the body (called  metastatic  basal cell carcinoma)<br />
* has spread to areas nearby (called  locally advanced  basal cell carcinoma) and your doctor 
decides that treatment with surgery or radiation is inappropriate </p>
<p>How Erivedge works 
Basal cell carcinoma develops when DNA in normal skin cells becomes damaged and the body cannot 
repair the damage. This damage can change how certain proteins in these cells work and the damaged 
cells become cancerous and begin to grow and divide. Erivedge is an anti-cancer medicine that works 
by controlling one of the key proteins involved in basal cell carcinoma. This may slow down or stop 
the growth of the cancer cells, or may kill them. As a result, your skin cancer may shrink. </p>         </div>"""

unborn babies. </p>
<p>Read carefully and follow the instructions of the patient brochure given to you by your doctor. </p>
<p>Do not take Erivedge 
* if you are allergic to vismodegib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant during the 
course of treatment or during the 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. This is 
because Erivedge may harm or cause the death of your unborn baby. 
* if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed during the course of treatment or during 
the 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. This is because it is unknown whether 
Erivedge can pass into your milk and cause harm to your baby. 
* if you are able to become pregnant but are unable or unwilling to follow the necessary 
pregnancy prevention measures that are listed in the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention 
Programme.<br />
* if you are also taking St John s wort (Hypericum perforatum)   a herbal medicine used for 
depression (see  Other medicines and Erivedge ). </p>
<p>More information on the issues above is found in the sections  Pregnancy ,  Breast-feeding  and 
 Fertility  and  Contraception   for men and women . </p>
<p>Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking Erivedge. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Erivedge if you have questions on the information in 
this section: </p>
<ul>
<li>You should not donate blood at any time during treatment and for 24 months after your final 
dose of this medicine. </li>
<li>If you are male, you should not donate semen at any time during treatment and for 2 months 
after the final dose.  </li>
<li>Serious skin reactions have been reported in association with Erivedge treatment. Stop using 
Erivedge and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described 
in section 4. * Never give this medicine to anyone else. You should return unused capsules at the end of your 
treatment. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist regarding where to return the capsules. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of Erivedge in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years is not recommended. This is 
because it is not known if it is safe or effective in this age group. Erivedge can cause bones to stop 
growing and lead to premature onset of puberty (before age 8 years in girls or age 9 years in boys). 
This can happen even after stopping Erivedge. Problems with growing teeth and bones were seen in 
animal studies with this medicine. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Erivedge 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This also includes non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may affect how Erivedge works, or make it more likely that you will have side 
effects. Erivedge can also affect how some other medicines work.<br />
In particular, tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: 
* rifampicin   used for bacterial infections 
* carbamazepine, phenytoin   used for epilepsy 
* ezetimibe and statins , such as atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin <br />
used for high cholesterol 
* bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, valsartan <br />
* topotecan   used for certain types of cancer 
* sulfasalazine   used for certain inflammatory disorders, and especially 
* St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum)   a herbal medicine used for depression, since you 
must not use it at the same time as Erivedge </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not take Erivedge if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become 
pregnant during the course of treatment or during the 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. </p>
<p>You must stop treatment and inform your doctor straight away if: you miss or think you have missed a 
period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect you are pregnant. If you do become 
pregnant during the treatment with Erivedge, you must stop the treatment and inform your doctor 
immediately. 
Erivedge may cause severe birth defects. It may also lead to the death of the unborn baby. Specific 
instructions (the Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention Programme), given to you by your doctor contain 
information particularly on the effects of Erivedge on unborn babies. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during your treatment and for 24 months after your final dose of this medicine. It is 
not known if Erivedge can pass into your breast milk and harm your baby. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Erivedge may affect a woman s ability to have children. Some women taking Erivedge have stopped 
having periods. If this happens to you, it is not known if your periods will come back. Talk to your 
doctor if you wish to have children in the future.  </p>
<p>Contraception   for men and women<br />
For women taking Erivedge 
Before starting the treatment, ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant. Even if your periods 
have stopped, it is essential to ask your doctor if there is any risk that you could become pregnant. 
If you are able to become pregnant: 
* you must take precautions so that you do not become pregnant while taking Erivedge 
* use 2 methods of contraception, one highly effective method and one barrier method (please see 
the examples below) 
* you need to continue contraception for 24 months after your final dose of this medicine <br />
because Erivedge may remain in your body for up to 24 months after your final dose </p>
<p>Method of recommended contraception: Talk to your doctor about the best two contraception methods 
for you.   </p>
<p>Use one highly effective method, such as: 
* a contraceptive depot injection<br />
* an intra-uterine device ( the coil  or IUD) 
* surgical sterilisation </p>
<p>You must also use one barrier method, such as: 
* a condom (with spermicide, if available) 
* a diaphragm (with spermicide, if available) </p>
<p>Your doctor will make sure to test you for pregnancy: 
* within a maximum of 7 days before starting treatment   to make sure that you are not already 
pregnant 
* every month during treatment  </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor immediately during the course of treatment or during the 24 months after 
your final dose of this medicine if: 
* you think your contraception has failed for any reason 
* your periods stop<br />
<em> you stop using contraception<br />
</em> you need to change contraception  </p>
<p>For men taking Erivedge 
Erivedge can pass into semen. Always use a condom (with spermicide, if available) even after a 
vasectomy, when you have sex with a female partner. Do this during treatment and for 2 months after 
your final dose of this medicine.  </p>
<p>You should not donate semen at any time during treatment and for 2 months after your final dose of 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Erivedge is unlikely to affect your ability to drive, use any tools or machines. Talk to your doctor if 
you are not sure. </p>
<p>Erivedge contains lactose and sodium 
Erivedge contains a type of sugar called lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say  essentially 
 sodium free .  </p>         </div>"""
