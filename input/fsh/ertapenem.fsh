- if you are allergic to the active substance (ertapenem) or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) 
- if you are allergic to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins or carbapenems (which are 
used to treat various infections). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before taking Ertapenem SUN. </p>
<p>During treatment, if you experience an allergic reaction (such as swelling of the face, tongue or throat, 
difficulty in breathing or swallowing, skin rash), tell your doctor straight away as you may need urgent 
medical treatment.  </p>
<p>While antibiotics including Ertapenem SUN kill certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may 
continue to grow more than normal. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you for 
overgrowth and treat you if necessary. </p>
<p>It is important that you tell your doctor if you have diarrhoea before, during or after your treatment 
with Ertapenem SUN. This is because you may have a condition known as colitis (an inflammation of 
the bowel). Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium valproate (see Other 
medicines and Ertapenem SUN below). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor about any medical condition you have or have had including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kidney disease. It is particularly important that your doctor knows if you have kidney disease 
and whether you undergo dialysis treatment. </li>
<li>Allergies to any medicines, including antibiotics. </li>
<li>Central nervous system disorders, such as localised tremors, or seizures. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents (3 months to 17 years of age) 
Experience with Ertapenem SUN is limited in children less than two years of age. In this age group 
your doctor will decide on the potential benefit of its use. There is no experience in children under 
3 months of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ertapenem SUN 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium 
valproate (used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraines, or schizophrenia). This is because 
Ertapenem SUN can affect the way some other medicines work. Your doctor will decide whether you 
should use Ertapenem SUN in combination with these other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Ertapenem SUN has not been studied in pregnant women. Ertapenem SUN should not be used during 
pregnancy unless your doctor decides the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. </p>
<p>Women who are receiving Ertapenem SUN should not breast-feed, because it has been found in 
human milk and the breast-fed baby may therefore be affected. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how you react to the medicine. 
Certain side effects, such as dizziness and sleepiness, have been reported with Ertapenem SUN, which 
may affect some patients  ability to drive or operate machinery. </p>
<p>Ertapenem SUN contains sodium 
This medicine contains approximately 158 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in 
each 1 g dose. This is equivalent to 7.9 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of 
sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose of Ertapenem SUN for adults and adolescents 13 years of age and older is 
1 gram (g) given once a day. The recommended dose for children 3 months to 12 years of age is 
15 mg/kg given twice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day). Your doctor will decide how many 
days  treatment you need. </p>
<p>For prevention of surgical site infections following surgery of the colon or rectum, the recommended 
dose of Ertapenem SUN is 1 g administered as a single intravenous dose 1 hour before surgery. </p>
