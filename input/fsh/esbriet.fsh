result makes it difficult to breathe deeply. This makes it hard for your lungs to work properly. Esbriet

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Esbriet </p>
<p>You may become more sensitive to sunlight (photosensitivity reaction) when taking Esbriet. </p>
<p>Avoid the sun (including sunlamps) whilst taking Esbriet. Wear sunblock daily and cover your </p>
<p>arms, legs and head to reduce exposure to sunlight (see section 4: Possible side effects). </p>
<p>You should not take other medicines, such as tetracycline antibiotics (such as doxycycline), </p>
<p>which may make you more sensitive to sunlight.   </p>
<p>You should tell your doctor if you suffer from kidney problems.   </p>
<p>You should tell your doctor if you suffer from mild to moderate liver problems. </p>
<p>You should stop smoking before and during treatment with Esbriet. Cigarette smoking can </p>
<p>reduce the effect of Esbriet. </p>
<p>Esbriet may cause dizziness and tiredness. Be careful if you have to take part in activities </p>
<p>where you have to be alert and co-ordinated.  </p>
<p>Esbriet can cause weight loss. Your doctor will monitor your weight whilst you are taking this </p>
<p>medicine. </p>
<p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in association </p>
<p>with Esbriet treatment. Stop using Esbriet and seek medical attention immediately if you </p>
<p>notice any of the symptoms related to these serious skin reactions described in section 4. Esbriet may cause serious liver problems and some cases have been fatal. You will need a blood test 
before you start taking Esbriet and at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and then every 3 months 
thereafter whilst you are taking this medicine to check whether your liver is working properly. It is 
important that you have these regular blood tests for as long as you are taking Esbriet.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents

<p>disease) </p>
<p>rifampicin (a type of antibiotic).  </p>

working properly.  </p>

become pregnant or think you might be pregnant as the potential risks to the unborn child are 
unknown. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed speak to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Esbriet. As it is unknown whether Esbriet passes into breast milk, your doctor will discuss the risks 
and benefits of taking this medicine while breast-feeding if you decide to do so. </p>
