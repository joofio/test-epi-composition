Do not give this medicine to infants under 6 months or below 5 kg in weight. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Eurartesim 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines can affect the way Eurartesim works and your doctor may decide that 
Eurartesim is not suitable or that extra checks are needed while you or your child is taking the 
medicines which could cause possible interactions. Examples are listed below (but there are several 
others):</p>
<ul>
<li>some medicines used to treat high cholesterol in the blood (such as atorvastatin, lovastatin, 
simvastatin); </li>
<li>medicines used to treat hypertension and heart problems (such as diltiazem, nifedipine,

<li>some medicines used to treat HIV (antiretroviral medicines): HIV-protease inhibitors (such as, 
atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (such as efavirenz, nevirapine); </li>
<li>
<p>some medicines used to treat microbial infections (such as telithromycin, rifampicin, dapsone); </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicines used to help you fall asleep: benzodiazepines (such as midazolam, triazolam,

<li>medicines used to prevent/treat epileptic seizures: barbiturates (such as phenobarbital),

<li>aprepitant (used to treat nausea); </li>
<li>some gases (such as enflurane, halothane and isoflurane) used to give a general anaesthetic. </li>
</ul>
<p>Eurartesim with food and drink 
You should take the Eurartesim tablets with water only. 
You should not take Eurartesim with grapefruit juice due to possible interactions. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, think you may be pregnant or become 
pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. Based on animal data Eurartesim is suspected to harm the 
unborn child when used during the first three months of pregnancy. Therefore Eurartesim must not be 
used in the 1st trimester of pregnancy if your doctor can give you an alternative medicine. If you find 
out that you are pregnant within one month from taking Eurartesim, please inform your doctor. The 
exposure of pregnant women during the 2nd and 3rd trimester was not associated with any harm of the 
unborn child. If Eurartesim is more suitable for a pregnant woman than other artemisinin-based 
combination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine pyrimethamine), Eurartesim 
may be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed your baby while taking this medicine because the medicine may pass 
through breast milk to your baby. </p>
<p>If you are taking folate supplements to prevent possible neural tube birth defects, you can continue 
taking them at the same time as Eurartesim. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine during pregnancy or breast-
feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You can drive or use machines after taking Eurartesim once you have recovered from your illness. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist. </p>
