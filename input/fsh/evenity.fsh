EVENITY contains the active substance romosozumab, a medicine that helps to make the bones 
stronger, and reduce the risk of broken bones.  </p>
<p>What EVENITY is used for 
EVENITY is used to treat severe osteoporosis in women after the menopause who are at high risk of 
broken bone (fracture).<br />
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and fragile. Many patients with 
osteoporosis have no symptoms, but they may be at increased risk of fractures.  </p>
<p>How EVENITY works 
EVENITY is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that has been 
designed to recognize and attach to specific proteins in the body. EVENITY attaches to a protein 
called sclerostin. By attaching to and blocking the activity of sclerostin, EVENITY:<br />
* helps to form new bone, and 
* slows down the loss of existing bone. 
This makes the bones stronger, and lowers the risk of fractures. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Do not use EVENITY if 
* you are allergic to romosozumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
* you have low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia). Your doctor will be able to tell 
you if your levels are too low; 
* you have a history of heart attack or stroke. </p>
<p>Do not use EVENITY if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using EVENITY. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist and discuss your medical history before using EVENITY. </p>
<p>Heart attack and stroke 
Heart attack and stroke have been reported in people receiving EVENITY.<br />
Seek medical attention straight away if you get: 
* chest pain, shortness of breath; 
* headache, numbness, or weakness in your face, arms, or legs, difficulty talking, changes in 
vision, loss of balance. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carefully evaluate the risk of cardiovascular problems before he/she lets you start 
treatment with EVENITY. Tell your doctor if you know that you have an increased risk of 
cardiovascular problems such as established cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, high blood 
fat levels, diabetes, smoking or kidney problems.   </p>
<p>Low levels of calcium in the blood 
EVENITY may cause low levels of calcium in your blood.<br />
Tell your doctor if you notice: 
* spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles; 
* numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to help prevent low calcium levels in your blood 
before you start your treatment and while you take EVENITY. Take calcium and vitamin D as your 
doctor tells you to.<br />
Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed 
dialysis as this may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium if you do not take calcium 
supplements. </p>
<p>Serious allergic reactions 
Serious allergic reactions can happen to people who use EVENITY.<br />
Seek medical attention straight away if you get: 
* swelling of the face, mouth, throat, hands, feet, ankles, lower legs (angioedema), or hives; 
* acute skin eruption showing multiple round, red/pink spots with a blistering or crusting centre 
(erythema multiforme); 
* difficulty in swallowing or breathing. </p>
<p>Problems with your mouth, teeth or jaw 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported rarely 
(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) in patients receiving EVENITY. ONJ can also occur after 
stopping treatment. It is important to try to prevent ONJ developing, as it may be a painful condition 
that can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing ONJ, there are some precautions 
you should take. </p>
<p>Draft </p>
<p>Before receiving EVENITY, tell your doctor or nurse if you: 
* have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction; 
* do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; 
* are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); 
* have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders, 
such as osteoporosis); 
* are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone); 
* have cancer. </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with EVENITY. </p>
<p>While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. If 
you wear dentures, you should make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or will 
undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell 
your dentist that you are being treated with EVENITY. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you get any problems with your mouth or teeth such 
as: 
* loose teeth; 
* pain or swelling; 
* mouth sores that do not heal; 
* discharge. </p>
<p>Unusual thigh bone fractures 
People who have used EVENITY rarely developed unusual fractures of the thigh bone caused by little 
or no trauma. These fracture types are often preceded by warning signs of thigh or groin pain for 
several weeks before the fracture occurs. It is not known whether EVENITY caused these unusual 
fractures. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you get any new or unusual pains in your hip, groin or 
thigh.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of romosozumab in children and adolescents has not been studied and it is not approved for 
use in paediatric patients (age &lt;18 years). </p>
<p>Other medicines and EVENITY 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
EVENITY is only intended to treat women after menopause.<br />
EVENITY should not be used by women of child-bearing potential, or when pregnant or breast-
feeding. It is not known whether EVENITY may harm an unborn or breast-fed child.<br />
Contact your doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
EVENITY is expected to have no effect or very little effect on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>EVENITY contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>

<p>How much to use 
* The recommended dose of EVENITY is 210 mg. 
* Since one pre-filled pen contains 105 mg of the active substance romosozumab in 1.17 ml of

given immediately after the first one but at a different injection site. <br />
* Do this once every month for 12 months. </p>
<p>How to use 
* EVENITY has to be injected under the skin (sub-cutaneous injection). 
* EVENITY should be injected in either the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh. The outer area of 
your upper arm can also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the 
injection. <br />
<em> If the same injection area is planned to be used for the second injection, a different injection 
spot should be used.<br />
