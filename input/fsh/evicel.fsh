<p>An application device and appropriate accessory tips are supplied separately. </p>
<p>Fibrinogen is a concentrate of clottable protein and thrombin is an enzyme that causes clottable protein to 
coalesce. Thus, when the two components are mixed together they clot instantly. </p>
<p>EVICEL is applied in adults during surgical operations to reduce bleeding and oozing during and after the 
operation.  </p>
<p>EVICEL can be used in blood vessel surgery and in surgery taking place on the posterior abdominal wall. 
EVICEL can also be used to support the watertight closure of the cerebral envelopes (dura mater) during 
neurosurgery when other surgical techniques are insufficient.  </p>

<p>If you are hypersensitive (allergic) to products made from human blood or to any of the other ingredients 
of EVICEL (listed in section 6). Signs of allergic reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, drop in blood pressure, and breathing difficulties. If these symptoms occur, the administration 
has to be discontinued immediately. </p>
<p>EVICEL must not be applied intravascularly. </p>
<p>EVICEL should not be used in endoscopic surgery. For laparoscopy, see recommendations below. </p>
<p>EVICEL must not be used for sealing the suture line in dura mater if there are gaps of greater than 2 mm 
after suturing. </p>
<p>EVICEL must not be used as a glue for the fixation of dural patches. </p>
<p>EVICEL must not be used as a sealant when the dura mater cannot be sutured. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>To avoid the risk of potentially fatal air or gas embolism EVICEL should be sprayed using 
pressurised CO2 gas only. </p>
<p>Prior to applying EVICEL, the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. 
intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). </p>
<p>When EVICEL is applied during surgery, the surgeon must ensure that it is only applied onto the surface 
of tissue. EVICEL must not be injected into tissue or blood vessels because it would cause clots which 
could be fatal.  </p>
<p>The use of EVICEL has not been studied in the following procedures, and there is therefore no 
information to show that it would be effective in these procedures: </p>
<p>gluing tissues together </p>
<p>surgery to the brain or spinal cord except for support of watertight closure of cerebral envelopes 
(dura mater) </p>
<p>controlling bleeding in the stomach or intestines by applying the product through an endoscope 
(tube) </p>
<p>sealing surgical repairs to the intestines </p>
<p>sealing in transphenoidal and otoneurosurgical procedures </p>
<p>It is not known whether radiation therapy could affect the effectiveness of fibrin sealant when used for 
suture line sealing during neurosurgery. </p>
<p>Use of EVICEL during neurosurgery in patients who are also being treated with implants or with dural 
patches has not been evaluated in clinical studies. </p>
<p>The bleeding should be controlled before EVICEL is used to seal the dural suture line. </p>
<p>EVICEL will be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the 
product s efficacy and the wound healing process. </p>
<p>Life-threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing a pressure 
regulator to administer EVICEL. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than 
recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. EVICEL spray application should 
only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance, especially during laparoscopy. Spray 
distance from tissue and pressure should be within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer (see table 
in section Instructions for Use). When spraying EVICEL, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen 
saturation, and end tidal CO2 should be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas 
embolism. Spray devices and accessory tips provide instructions for use with recommendations for pressure 
ranges and proximity to tissue surface, which should be carefully followed.  </p>
<p>Nearby areas should be protected to make sure that EVICEL is only applied onto the surface which is to 
be treated. </p>
<p>As with any product containing proteins, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of 
such reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, drop in blood pressure and 
anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration has to be discontinued immediately. </p>
<p>When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to prevent </p>
<p>infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to 
make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of 
plasma for signs of viruses/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the 
processing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when 
medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses, or other 
types of infections. </p>
<p>The measures taken in the manufacture of fibrinogen and thrombin are considered effective for lipid coated 
viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus, and the 
non-enveloped virus, hepatitis A. The measures taken may be of limited value against parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals whose 
immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g., sickle cell disease or haemolytic 
anaemia). </p>
<p>The healthcare professionals will record the name and batch number of the medicinal product in order to 
trace any possible infection source. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Paediatric data are available to support efficacy and safety of EVICEL in this population.   </p>
<p>Other medicines and EVICEL 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, 
even those not prescribed. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
There is not enough information available to know whether any particular risks are associated with the use of 
EVICEL during pregnancy or whilst breast-feeding. However, since EVICEL is used during a surgical 
operation, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you should discuss the overall risks of the operation with 
your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

two components of EVICEL to be administered at the same time, and ensures that they mix evenly, which is 
important for the sealant to have its optimal effect. </p>
<p>The amount of EVICEL that will be applied depends on the surface area of tissue to be treated during the 
operation. It will be dripped onto the tissue in very small amounts or sprayed in short bursts (0.1-0.2 ml), to 
produce a thin, even layer. If application of a single layer of EVICEL does not completely stop the bleeding, 
a second layer may be applied. </p>         </div>"""

side effects which occurred during clinical studies were considered to be related to the use of EVICEL:  </p>
<p>Most serious side effects 
  Watery fluid coming out of your wound or nose (CSF leakage/CSF rhinorrhea). The frequency of the 
effects was common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
  Headache, nausea, and vomiting (due to Subdural Hygroma, which is accumulation of CSF in the subdural 
space). The frequency of the effect was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). </p>
<p>Fever, or prolonged constipation, flatulence (due to abdominal abscess). The frequency of the effect was 
common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).<br />
  Collection of cerebrospinal fluid between the tissues surrounding dural layer due to leakage of the fluid 
that normally surrounds the brain (pseudomeningocele). The frequency of the effect was uncommon (may 
affect up to 1 in 100 people).<br />
- Numbness or pain in your extremities, change in skin colour (due to Graft Occlusion or Thrombosis) 
The frequency of this effect was uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). </p>
<p>If you experience any of the above mentioned symptoms, or any other symptoms related to your surgery, 
please contact your doctor or surgeon immediately. If you feel unwell tell your doctor immediately, even if 
your symptoms are different from those just described. </p>
<p>Other side effects 
Other side effects which were reported to be common during clinical trials with EVICEL (i.e., may affect up 
to 1 in 10 people) included fever and difficulties with blood clotting. . The frequency of all of these effects was 
common. </p>
<p>Side effects which were uncommon during clinical trials with EVICEL (i.e., may affect up to 1 in 
100 people) included meningitis, accumulation of CSF fluid in the brain cavities (hydrocephalus), infection, 
blood accumulation (haematoma), swelling, decreased haemoglobin, and post-operative wound 
complications (including bleeding or infection). </p>
<p>EVICEL is a fibrin sealant.  Fibrin sealants in general may, in rare cases (up to 1 patient in 1,000 people), 
cause an allergic reaction.  If you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or more of the 
following symptoms: skin rash, hives or wheals (nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, 
headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, increased heart rate, tingling, vomiting, or 
wheezing. No allergic reactions have so far been reported in patients treated with EVICEL. </p>
<p>There is also a theoretical possibility that you could develop antibodies to the proteins in EVICEL, which 
could potentially interfere with blood clotting. The frequency of the type of event is not known (cannot be 
estimated from available data). </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
