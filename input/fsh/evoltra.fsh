anticancer medicines. It works by hindering the growth of abnormal white blood cells, and eventually 
kills them. It works best against cells which are multiplying quickly – such as cancer cells. </p>
<p>Evoltra is used to treat children (≥ 1 year old), teenagers and young adults up to 21 years old with 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when previous treatments have not worked or have stopped 
working. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by abnormal growth of some types of white blood

- if you are allergic to clofarabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
- if you are breast-feeding (please read the section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding” below); 
- if you have severe kidney or liver problems. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you.  If you are the parent of a child who is 
being treated with Evoltra, tell the doctor if any of them apply to your child. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  Evoltra may not be suitable for you: 
- if you have suffered a severe reaction after previously using this medicine; 
- if you have kidney disease, or used to have it; 
- if you have liver disease, or used to have it; 
- if you have heart disease, or used to have it. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or carer immediately if you experience any of the following as you may need to 
stop treatment: 
- if you get a fever or high temperature – because clofarabine reduces the number of blood cells 
made in the bone marrow, you may be more likely to catch infections; 
- if you have breathing difficulties, rapid breathing, or breathlessness; 
- if you feel a change in your heart rate; 
- if you suffer from dizziness (light-headedness) or fainting – it may be a symptom of low blood 
pressure; 
- if you feel sick or have diarrhoea (loose bowels); 
- if your urine is darker than usual – it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration; 
- if you get a rash with blisters or mouth ulcers;<br />
- if you lose your appetite, have nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhea, dark-colored urine and 
light-coloured stools, stomach pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), or if you feel 
generally unwell, these could be symptoms of an inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), or liver 
damage (hepatic failure); 
- if you pass little or no urine, or experience drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, loss of 
appetite and / or weakness (these may be signs of acute kidney failure / kidney failure).  </p>
<p>If you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Evoltra, tell the doctor if any of the above 
conditions apply to your child. </p>
<p>During treatment with Evoltra, your doctor will carry out regular blood tests and other tests to 
monitor your health.  Because of the way this medicine works, it will affect your blood and other 
organs. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about contraception.  Young men and women must use effective contraception 
during and after treatment.  See the section ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding’ below.  Evoltra may harm 
both male and female reproductive organs.  Ask your doctor to explain what can be done to protect 
you or allow you to have a family. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Evoltra 
Tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used: 
- medicines for heart disease; 
- any medicine that changes your blood pressure; 
- medicines that affect your liver or kidneys; 
- any other medicines including those obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Clofarabine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Women who are able to get pregnant: you must use effective contraception during treatment with 
clofarabine and for 6 months following completion of treatment. Clofarabine may cause harm to 
unborn babies when used by pregnant women.  If you are pregnant or you become pregnant during 
treatment with clofarabine, get medical advice immediately. </p>
<p>Men must also use effective contraception and be advised to not father a child while receiving 
clofarabine, and for 3 months following completion of treatment. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, you must stop breast-feeding before starting the treatment, and must not 
breast-feed during your treatment and within 2 weeks after completion of your treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy, light-headed or faint. </p>
<p>Evoltra contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains 72 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 3.6 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Talk to 
your pharmacist or doctor if you need 5 or more vials daily during your treatment cycle for a 
prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Special precautions for administration 
Evoltra 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion must be diluted prior to administration. It should 
be filtered through a sterile 0.2 micrometre syringe filter and then diluted with sodium chloride 9 
mg/ml (0.9%) intravenous infusion to produce a total volume according to the examples given in the 
table below. However, the final dilution volume may vary depending on the patient’s clinical status 
and physician discretion. (If the use of a 0.2 micrometre syringe filter is not feasible, the concentrate 
should be pre-filtered with a 5 micrometre filter, diluted and then administered through a 0.micrometre inline filter.) </p>
