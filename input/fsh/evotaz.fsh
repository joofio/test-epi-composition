  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>EVOTAZ contains two active substances: 
* atazanavir, an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease 
inhibitors. These medicines control human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by stopping 
production of a protein that HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount 
of HIV in your body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way atazanavir 
reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
* cobicistat, a booster (pharmacokinetic enhancer) to help improve the effects of atazanavir. 
Cobicistat, does not directly treat your HIV, but boosts the levels of atazanavir in the blood. It 
does this by slowing down the breakdown of atazanavir which will make it stay in the body for 
longer. </p>
<p>EVOTAZ may be used by adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg), 
who are infected with HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is 
used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to help control your HIV infection. Your doctor 
will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with EVOTAZ is best for you. </p>         </div>"""

hypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you 
are using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Some people will need special care before or while taking EVOTAZ. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking EVOTAZ. </p>
<p>EVOTAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other illnesses 
linked to HIV infection. </p>
<p>Make sure your doctor knows: 
* if you have liver problems 
* if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain in your right side). Gall stones have been 
reported in patients taking atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ. 
* if you have type A or B haemophilia. You may notice increased bleeding. 
* if you have problems with your kidneys or require haemodialysis. Kidney stones have been 
reported in patients taking atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ. If you develop signs or 
symptoms of kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), 
please inform your doctor immediately 
* if you are taking oral contraceptives ("the Pill") to prevent pregnancy. If you are currently 
using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, you should use 
an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) </p>
<p>In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the 
opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system 
attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your 
HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in 
hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, 
please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Hyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients 
receiving EVOTAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these 
symptoms please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Serious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, may develop in patients taking EVOTAZ. If 
you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>EVOTAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. </p>
<p>If you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age or who weigh less than 35 kg, as the 
use of EVOTAZ was not studied in this population. </p>

used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, 
joints and muscles and other inflammatory conditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should 
only take place after medical evaluation and under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid 
side effects. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>EVOTAZ should not be used during pregnancy, because the drug levels in your blood may be lower 
during pregnancy and may no longer be high enough to control HIV. Your doctor may prescribe 
different medicines if you become pregnant while taking EVOTAZ. </p>
<p>Atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ is excreted in human milk. It is unknown if cobicistat, the other 
component of EVOTAZ, is excreted in human milk but it has been shown in animals that it is excreted 
in milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking EVOTAZ. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>

EVOTAZ. If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive, use any tools or use machines and contact
