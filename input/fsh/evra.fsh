Before you start using EVRA you should read the information on blood clots in section 2. It is 
particularly important to read the symptoms of a blood clot - see section 2  Blood clots . </p>
<p>When you should not use EVRA 
You should not use EVRA if you have any of the conditions listed below. If you do have any of the 
conditions listed below, you must tell your doctor. Your doctor will discuss with you what other form 
of birth control would be more appropriate. 
* if you have (or have ever had) a blood clot in a blood vessel of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, 
DVT), your lungs (pulmonary embolus, PE) or other organs; 
* if you know you have a disorder affecting your blood clotting - for instance, protein C 
deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin-III deficiency, Factor V Leiden or 
antiphospholipid antibodies; 
* if you need an operation or if you are off your feet for a long time (see section  Blood clots ); 
* if you have ever had a heart attack or a stroke; 
* if you have (or have ever had) angina pectoris (a condition that causes severe chest pain and 
may be a first sign of a heart attack) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA   temporary stroke 
symptoms); 
* if you have a disease that may increase your risk of a clot in the arteries:</p>
<ul>
<li>severe diabetes with blood vessel damage </li>
<li>very high blood pressure </li>
<li>a very high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol or triglycerides) </li>
<li>a condition known as hyperhomocysteinaemia </li>
<li>if you have (or have ever had) a type of migraine called  migraine with aura ; </li>
<li>if you are allergic to norelgestromin, ethinyl estradiol or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6); </li>
<li>if you have ever been told you might have breast cancer or cancer of the womb, cervix or 
vagina; </li>
<li>if you have ever had liver tumours or a liver disease because of which your liver does not 
function properly; </li>
<li>if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding; </li>
<li>if you have hepatitis C and are taking the medicinal products containing 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (see also in section  Other medicines and EVRA ). </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. </p>
<p>When to take special care with EVRA 
When should you contact your doctor? </p>
<p>Seek urgent medical attention 
* if you notice possible signs of a blood clot that may mean you are suffering from a blood clot 
in the leg (i.e. deep vein thrombosis), a blood clot in the lung (i.e. pulmonary embolism), a 
heart attack or a stroke (see  Blood clot [thrombosis] section below). </p>
<p>For a description of the symptoms of these serious side effects please go to  How to recognise a 
blood clot . </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before using this medicine, you will need to see your doctor for a medical check-up. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of the following conditions apply to you. </p>
<p>If the condition develops, or gets worse while you are using EVRA, you must tell your doctor. 
* if you have Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis (chronic inflammatory bowel disease); 
* if you have SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus; a disease affecting your natural defence 
system); 
* if you have haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS - a disorder of blood clotting causing failure of 
the kidneys); 
* if you have sickle cell anaemia (an inherited disease of the red blood cells); 
* if you have elevated levels of fat in the blood (hypertriglyceridaemia) or a positive family 
history for this condition. Hypertriglyceridaemia has been associated with an increased risk of 
developing pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas); 
* if you need an operation, or you are off your feet for a long time (see in section 2  Blood clots ); 
* if you have just given birth you are at an increased risk of blood clots. You should ask your 
doctor how soon after delivery you can start taking EVRA; 
* if you have an inflammation in the veins under the skin (superficial thrombophlebitis); 
* if you have varicose veins. 
* if you experience symptoms of angioedema such as swollen face, tongue and/or throat and/or 
difficulty swallowing or hives potentially with difficulty breathing contact a doctor 
immediately. Products containing estrogens may cause or worsen the symptoms of hereditary 
and acquired angioedema. </p>
<p>BLOOD CLOTS </p>
<p>Using a combined hormonal contraceptive such as EVRA increases your risk of developing a blood 
clot compared with not using one. In rare cases a blood clot can block blood vessels and cause serious 
problems. </p>
<p>Blood clots can develop 
* in veins (referred to as a  venous thrombosis ,  venous thromboembolism  or VTE) 
* in the arteries (referred to as an  arterial thrombosis ,  arterial thromboembolism  or ATE). </p>
<p>Recovery from blood clots is not always complete. Rarely, there may be serious lasting effects or, very 
rarely, they may be fatal. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that the overall risk of a harmful blood clot due to EVRA is small. </p>
<p>HOW TO RECOGNISE A BLOOD CLOT </p>
<p>Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any of the following signs or symptoms. </p>
<p>Are you experiencing any of these signs? 
What are you possibly 
suffering from? 
* swelling of one leg or along a vein in the leg or foot 
especially when accompanied by:</p>
<ul>
<li>pain or tenderness in the leg which may be felt only 
when standing or walking; </li>
<li>increased warmth in the affected leg; </li>
<li>change in colour of the skin on the leg e.g. turning 
pale, red or blue. 
Deep vein thrombosis </li>
<li>sudden unexplained breathlessness or rapid breathing; </li>
<li>sudden cough without an obvious cause, which may bring 
up blood; </li>
<li>sharp chest pain which may increase with deep breathing; </li>
<li>severe light headedness or dizziness; </li>
<li>rapid or irregular heartbeat; </li>
<li>severe pain in your stomach. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure, talk to a doctor as some of these symptoms such 
as coughing or being short of breath may be mistaken for a milder 
condition such as a respiratory tract infection (e.g. a  common 
cold ). 
Pulmonary embolism 
Symptoms most commonly occur in one eye: 
* immediate loss of vision or; 
* painless blurring of vision which can progress to loss of 
vision. 
Retinal vein thrombosis (blood 
clot in the eye) 
* chest pain, discomfort, pressure, heaviness; 
* sensation of squeezing or fullness in the chest, arm or 
below the breastbone; 
* fullness, indigestion or choking feeling; 
* upper body discomfort radiating to the back, jaw, throat, 
arm and stomach; 
* sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness; 
* extreme weakness, anxiety, or shortness of breath; 
* rapid or irregular heartbeats. 
Heart attack 
* sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg, 
especially on one side of the body; 
* sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding; 
* sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; 
* sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or 
coordination; 
* sudden, severe or prolonged headache with no known 
cause; 
* loss of consciousness or fainting with or without seizure. </p>
<p>Sometimes the symptoms of stroke can be brief with an almost 
immediate and full recovery, but you should still seek urgent 
medical attention as you may be at risk of another stroke. 
Stroke 
* swelling and slight blue discolouration of an extremity; 
* severe pain in your stomach (acute abdomen). 
Blood clots blocking other 
blood vessels </p>
<p>BLOOD CLOTS IN A VEIN </p>
<p>What can happen if a blood clot forms in a vein? 
* The use of combined hormonal contraceptives has been connected with an increase in the risk of 
blood clots in the vein (venous thrombosis). However, these side effects are rare. Most 
frequently, they occur in the first year of use of a combined hormonal contraceptive. 
* If a blood clot forms in a vein in the leg or foot it can cause a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 
* If a blood clot travels from the leg and lodges in the lung it can cause a pulmonary embolism. 
* Very rarely a clot may form in a vein in another organ such as the eye (retinal vein thrombosis). </p>
<p>When is the risk of developing a blood clot in a vein highest? 
The risk of developing a blood clot in a vein is highest during the first year of taking a combined 
hormonal contraceptive for the first time. The risk may also be higher if you restart taking a combined 
hormonal contraceptive (the same product or a different product) after a break of 4 weeks or more. </p>
<p>After the first year, the risk gets smaller but is always slightly higher than if you were not using a 
combined hormonal contraceptive. </p>
<p>When you stop EVRA your risk of a blood clot returns to normal within a few weeks. </p>
<p>What is the risk of developing a blood clot? 
The risk depends on your natural risk of VTE and the type of combined hormonal contraceptive you 
are taking. </p>
<p>The overall risk of a blood clot in the leg or lung (DVT or PE) with EVRA is small. </p>
<ul>
<li>Out of 10,000 women who are not using any combined hormonal contraceptive and are not 
pregnant, about 2 will develop a blood clot in a year. </li>
<li>Out of 10,000 women who are using a combined hormonal contraceptive that contains 
levonorgestrel, norethisterone, or norgestimate about 5-7 will develop a blood clot in a year. </li>
<li>Out of 10,000 women who are using a combined hormonal contraceptive that contains 
etonorgestrel or norelgestromin such as EVRA between about 6 and 12 women will develop a 
blood clot in a year. </li>
<li>The risk of having a blood clot will vary according to your personal medical history (see 
 Factors that increase your risk of a blood clot  below). </li>
</ul>
<p>Risk of developing a blood clot in a year 
Women who are not using a combined 
hormonal pill/patch/ring and are not pregnant 
About 2 out of 10 000 women 
Women using a combined hormonal 
contraceptive pill containing levonorgestrel, 
norethisterone or norgestimate 
About 5-7 out of 10 000 women 
Women using EVRA 
About 6-12 out of 10 000 women </p>
<p>Factors that increase your risk of a blood clot in a vein 
The risk of a blood clot with EVRA is small but some conditions will increase the risk. Your risk is 
higher: 
* if you are very overweight (body mass index or BMI over 30 kg/m2); 
* if one of your immediate family has had a blood clot in the leg, lung or other organ at a young 
age (e.g. below the age of about 50). In this case you could have a hereditary blood clotting 
disorder; 
* if you need to have an operation, or if you are off your feet for a long time because of an injury 
or illness, or you have your leg in a cast. The use of EVRA may need to be stopped several 
weeks before surgery or while you are less mobile. If you need to stop EVRA ask your doctor 
when you can start using it again; 
* as you get older (particularly above about 35 years); 
* if you gave birth less than a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>The risk of developing a blood clot increases the more conditions you have. </p>
<p>Air travel (&gt; 4 hours) may temporarily increase your risk of a blood clot, particularly if you have some 
of the other factors listed. </p>
<p>It is important to tell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you, even if you are unsure. Your 
doctor may decide that EVRA needs to be stopped. </p>
<p>If any of the above conditions change while you are using EVRA, for example a close family member 
experiences a thrombosis for no known reason; or you gain a lot of weight, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>BLOOD CLOTS IN AN ARTERY </p>
<p>What can happen if a blood clot forms in an artery? 
Like a blood clot in a vein, a clot in an artery can cause serious problems. For example, it can cause a 
heart attack or a stroke. </p>
<p>Factors that increase your risk of a blood clot in an artery 
It is important to note that the risk of a heart attack or stroke from using EVRA is very small but can 
increase: 
* with increasing age (beyond about 35 years); 
* if you smoke. When using a combined hormonal contraceptive like EVRA you are advised to 
stop smoking. If you are unable to stop smoking and are older than 35 your doctor may advise 
you to use a different type of contraceptive; 
* if you are overweight; 
* if you have high blood pressure; 
* if a member of your immediate family has had a heart attack or stroke at a young age (less than 
about 50). In this case you could also have a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke; 
* if you, or someone in your immediate family, have a high level of fat in the blood (cholesterol 
or triglycerides); 
* if you get migraines, especially migraines with aura; 
* if you have a problem with your heart (valve disorder, disturbance of the rhythm called atrial 
fibrillation); 
* if you have diabetes. </p>
<p>If you have more than one of these conditions or if any of them are particularly severe the risk of 
developing a blood clot may be increased even more. 
If any of the above conditions change while you are using EVRA, for example you start smoking, a 
close family member experiences a thrombosis for no known reason; or you gain a lot of weight, tell 
your doctor. </p>
<p>Psychiatric disorders 
Some women using hormonal contraceptives including EVRA have reported depression or depressed 
mood. Depression can be serious and may sometimes lead to suicidal thoughts. If you experience 
mood changes and depressive symptoms contact your doctor for further medical advice as soon as 
possible. </p>
<p>Additionally, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using EVRA if you have any of the 
following or they happen or get worse while using EVRA: 
* You think you might be pregnant; 
* You have headaches that get worse or happen more often; 
* You weigh 90 kg (which is 14 stone 2 lb) or more; 
* You have high blood pressure or your blood pressure gets higher; 
* You have gallbladder disease including gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder; 
* You have a blood problem called porphyria; 
* You have a problem of the nervous system involving sudden movements of the body called 
 Sydenham s chorea ; 
* You had a skin rash with blisters during pregnancy (called  herpes gestationis ); 
* You have a hearing loss; 
* You have diabetes; 
* You have depression; 
* You have epilepsy or any other problem that can cause fits (convulsions); 
* You have liver problems including yellowing of the skin and whites of the eye (jaundice); 
* You have or have had  pregnancy spots . These are yellowish-brown patches or spots, 
especially on your face (called  chloasma ). These spots may not go away completely, even 
after you stop using EVRA. Protect your skin from sunlight or ultraviolet radiation. This may 
help prevent you from getting these spots or help prevent them from getting worse. 
* You have kidney problems. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
EVRA. </p>
<p>Sexually transmitted disease 
This medicine will not protect you against HIV infection (AIDS) or any other sexually transmitted 
disease. These include chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B, syphilis. 
Always use condoms to protect yourself from these diseases. </p>
<p>Medical tests 
* If you need a blood or urine test, tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are taking 
EVRA, because hormonal contraceptives can affect the results of some tests. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
EVRA has not been studied in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. EVRA must not be 
used in children and adolescents who have not yet had their first menstrual period. </p>
<p>Other medicines and EVRA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use EVRA if you have Hepatitis C and are taking the medicinal products containing 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir as these products may cause increases in liver function blood test 
results (increase in ALT liver enzyme). Your doctor will prescribe another type of contraceptive prior 
to start of the treatment with these medicinal products. EVRA can be restarted approximately 2 weeks 
after completion of this treatment. See section  When you should not use EVRA . </p>
<p>Certain medicines and herbal therapies may stop EVRA from working properly. If this happens you 
could get pregnant, or may experience unexpected bleeding. 
These include medicines used for the treatment of: 
* some antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C virus infections (so-
called protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as ritonavir, 
nevirapine, efavirenz) 
* medicines for infection (such as rifampicin and griseofulvin) 
* anti-seizure medicines (such as barbiturates, topiramate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, 
oxcarbazepine, and felbamate) 
* bosentan (a medicine for high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs) 
* St. John s wort (an herbal therapy used for depression) </p>
<p>If you take any of these medicines, you may need to use another method of birth control (such as a 
condom, diaphragm or foam). The interfering effect of some of these medicines can last for up to 
28 days after you have stopped taking them. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about using another 
method of birth control if you use EVRA and any of the above medicines concomitantly. </p>
<p>EVRA may make some other medicines less effective, such as: 
* medicines containing ciclosporin 
* lamotrigine used for epilepsy [This can increase the risk of fits (seizures)]. </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of the other medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
* Do not use this medicine if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. 
* Stop using this medicine right away if you become pregnant. 
* Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed. </p>
<p>If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You can drive or use machines while using this medicine. </p>
<p>Risks of using combined hormonal contraceptives 
The following information is based on information about combined birth control pills. As the EVRA 
transdermal patch contains similar hormones to those used in combined birth control pills, it is likely 
to have the same risks. All combined birth control pills have risks, which may lead to disability or 
death. </p>
<p>It has not been shown that a transdermal patch like EVRA is safer than a combined birth control pill 
taken by mouth. </p>
<p>Combined hormonal contraceptives and cancer </p>
<p>Cervical cancer 
Cervical cancer has been found more often in women taking combined hormonal contraceptives. 
However, this may be due to other causes including sexually-transmitted disease. </p>
<p>Breast cancer 
Breast cancer has been found more often in women who take combined hormonal contraceptives. 
However, it is possible that the combined hormonal contraceptive is not the cause of more women 
having breast cancer. It may be that women taking the combined hormonal contraceptive are examined 
more often. This might mean that there is a better chance of the breast cancer being noticed. The 
increased risk gradually goes down after stopping the combined hormonal contraceptive. After 
10 years, the risk is the same as for people who have never used the combined hormonal 
contraceptive. </p>
<p>Liver cancer 
In rare cases, liver tumours which are not cancer have been found in women taking combined 
hormonal contraceptives. Even more rarely, liver tumours which are cancer have been found. This can 
cause bleeding inside the body with very bad pain in the stomach area. If this happens to you, talk to 
your doctor immediately. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Important information to follow when using the patch 
* Change EVRA on the same day of each week. This is because it is designed to work over 
7 days. 
* Never go without wearing a patch for more than 7 days in a row. 
* Only wear one patch at a time. 
* Do not cut or tamper with the patch in any way. 
* Do not put the patch on skin that is red, irritated or cut. 
* To work properly the patch must stick firmly to your skin. 
* Press the patch down firmly until the edges stick well. 
* Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powder or makeup on the skin where you are placing a patch or 
near a patch you are wearing. This may make the patch come loose. 
* Do not put a new patch on the same area of skin as the old patch. If you do you are more likely 
to cause irritation. 
* Check each day to make sure the patch has not fallen off. 
* Keep using the patches even if you do not have sex very often. </p>
<p>How to use the patch: </p>

Try not to touch the sticky surface. </li>
</ul>
<p>Put the patch on your skin. </p>
<ul>
<li>Then take off the other half of the covering </li>
<li>Press down firmly on the patch with the palm of your hand for 
10 seconds </li>
<li>Make sure that the edges stick well. </li>

Week 4, you may pick a new Change Day and apply the first patch on that day. You should never go 
more than 7 days in a row without wearing a patch. </p>

wearing a patch on Week 4. You may experience light or breakthrough bleeding. Do not wear more

6 consecutive weeks), do not put on a patch in week 7. After 7 days of not wearing a patch, apply a 
new patch and restart the cycle using this as Day 1. Talk with your doctor before deciding to delay 
your period. </p>

<p>If you have absent or irregular bleeding with EVRA 
This medicine may cause unexpected vaginal bleeding or spotting during the weeks when you are 
wearing the patch. 
* This usually stops after the first few cycles. 
* Mistakes in using your patches can also cause spotting and light bleeding. 
* Continue using this medicine and if the bleeding lasts more than the first three cycles, talk to 
your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you do not get your period during the EVRA patch-free week (Week 4), you should still use a new 
patch on your usual  Patch Change Day .

necessarily mean that you are pregnant. 
* However, if you miss two periods in a row, talk to your doctor or pharmacist as you may be 
pregnant. </p>
<p>If you use more EVRA than you should (more than one EVRA patch at any one time)

<p>Using too many patches may cause you to have the following: 
* Feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) 
* Bleeding from the vagina. </p>

You may get irregular, little or no menstruation. This usually happens in the first 3 months and
