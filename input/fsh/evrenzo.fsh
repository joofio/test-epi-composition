Evrenzo is a medicine that increases the number of red blood cells and haemoglobin level in your 
blood. It contains the active substance roxadustat. </p>
<p>What Evrenzo is used for 
Evrenzo is used to treat adults with symptomatic anaemia that occurs in patients with chronic kidney 
disease. Anaemia is when you have too few red blood cells and your haemoglobin level is too low. As 
a result, your body might not receive enough oxygen. Anaemia can cause symptoms such as tiredness, 
weakness, or shortness of breath. </p>
<p>How Evrenzo works 
Roxadustat, the active substance in Evrenzo, works by increasing the level of HIF, a substance in the 
body which increases the production of red blood cells when oxygen levels are low. By raising HIF 
levels, the medicine increases the production of red blood cells and raises the levels of haemoglobin 
(the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells). This improves the oxygen supply to your body and 
may reduce your symptoms of anaemia. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. Evrenzo contains soya lecithin. 
* if you are allergic to roxadustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* if you are more than 6 months pregnant (it is also better to avoid this medicine in early 
pregnancy - see pregnancy section). 
* if you are breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, or pharmacist before taking Evrenzo: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have epilepsy or have ever had convulsions or fits. </li>
<li>if you have signs and symptoms of an infection, which may include fever, sweating or chills, 
sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath, feeling weak, confusion, cough, vomiting, diarrhoea 
or stomach pain, feeling of burning when you pass urine, red or painful skin or sores on your 
body. </li>
<li>if you have a liver disorder. </li>
</ul>
<p>Chronic kidney disease and anaemia may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and death. 
Managing your anaemia is important. Your doctor will monitor your haemoglobin and also consider 
your treatment regimen as anaemia treatment and switching between anaemia treatments may also 
have a negative impact on your cardiovascular health. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, or pharmacist straight away: 
* if you get blood clots: 
1. in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT), signs of which can include pain 
and/or swelling in the legs, cramping or a feeling of warmth in the affected leg; 
2. in the lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE), signs of which can include sudden shortness of 
breath, chest pain (usually worse with breathing), feeling of anxiety, dizziness, light-
headedness, or fainting; heart racing, coughing (sometimes with blood); 
3. in your haemodialysis access (vascular access thrombosis or VAT) that stop the vascular 
access from working; signs of this can include swelling, redness, hardening or thickening 
of the skin around your access, oozing at the access site, not feeling a vibration ( thrill ) 
over the access area; 
* if you have a seizure (convulsion or fit) or possible warning signs that a seizure may occur, such 
as headache, irritability, fear, confusion or unusual feelings; 
* if you have signs and symptoms of an infection, which include fever, sweating or chills, sore 
throat, runny nose, shortness of breath, feeling weak or faint, confusion, cough, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, or stomach pain, burning when you pass urine, red or painful skin or sores on your 
body. </p>
<p>Misuse can lead to an increase in blood cells and consequently thicken the blood. This can cause life-
threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give Evrenzo to children and adolescents aged under 18 years because there is not enough 
information about its use in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Evrenzo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Evrenzo may affect the way these medicines work, or these medicines may affect how 
Evrenzo works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have, or are taking any of the following medicines: 
* medicines to reduce phosphate levels in your blood (called phosphate binders) or other 
medicines or supplements that contain calcium, iron, magnesium or aluminium (called 
multivalent cations), such as sevelamer carbonate or calcium acetate. You must take Evrenzo at 
least 1 hour after these medicines or supplements. Otherwise roxadustat will not be properly 
absorbed by your body. 
* a medicine to treat gout called probenecid. 
* medicines used to lower cholesterol, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin (also 
called  statins ), or gemfibrozil. 
* other medicines used to treat anaemia such as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). </p>
<p>If you normally take any of these medicines, your doctor might change it and prescribe a different 
medicine for you during your treatment with Evrenzo. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, contact your doctor. 
Evrenzo may harm your unborn baby. Evrenzo is not recommended in the first 6 months of pregnancy 
and must not be taken in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Women taking Evrenzo who are able to 
become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Evrenzo and 
for at least one week after the last dose of Evrenzo. If you use a hormonal contraceptive, you must also 
use a barrier method, such as a condom, or a diaphragm. </p>
<p>Do not breastfeed if you are on treatment with Evrenzo. It is not known if Evrenzo passes into your 
breast milk and could harm your baby.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Seizures can occur as a side effect (see 
section 4).   </p>
<p>Evrenzo contains lactose, soya lecithin and Allura Red AC aluminium lake 
Evrenzo contains sugar (lactose), traces of peanut and soya (soya lecithin), and an azo colouring agent 
(Allura Red AC aluminium lake). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars or are allergic to peanut, soya or azo colouring agents, contact your doctor before taking 
this medicine.  </p>         </div>"""
