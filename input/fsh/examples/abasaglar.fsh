If you are allergic to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ABASAGLAR. 
Follow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical 
activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the 
end of this leaflet). </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site. 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Abasaglar). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, </li>
<li>supplies of insulin etc. </li>
<li>correct storage of your insulin while travelling, </li>
<li>timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, </li>
<li>the possible effects of changing to different time zones, </li>
<li>possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, </li>
<li>what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. </li>
</ul>
<p>Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, 
adjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests):</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). </li>
<li>If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. </p>
<p>Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. </p>
<p>Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your 
doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath 
or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). </p>
<p>Insulin mix-ups 
You must always check the pack and the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between 
ABASAGLAR and other insulins. </p>
<p>Children 
There is no experience with the use of ABASAGLAR in children below the age of 2 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ABASAGLAR 
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. </p>
<p>Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>all other medicines to treat diabetes, </li>
<li>angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), </li>
<li>disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), </li>
<li>fluoxetine (used to treat depression), </li>
<li>fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), </li>
<li>monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), </li>
<li>pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),  </li>
<li>somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, used to treat an uncommon condition in which you 
make too much growth hormone), </li>
<li>sulphonamide antibiotics. </li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), </li>
<li>danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), </li>
<li>diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), </li>
<li>diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), </li>
<li>glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), </li>
<li>isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), </li>
<li>oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  </li>
<li>phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), </li>
<li>somatropin (growth hormone), </li>
<li>sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), </li>
<li>thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), </li>
<li>atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), </li>
<li>protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:</p>
<ul>
<li>beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), </li>
<li>clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), </li>
<li>lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. </p>
<p>Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.<br />
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>ABASAGLAR with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), </li>
<li>you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), </li>
<li>
<p>you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, </p>
</li>
<li>the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. </li>
</ul>
<p>ABASAGLAR contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, which means it is essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

you are not sure. 
Although ABASAGLAR contains the same active substance as Toujeo (insulin glargine 
300 units/mL), these medicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to 
another requires medical prescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please 
consult your doctor for further information. </p>
<p>Dose 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will:</p>
<ul>
<li>determine how much ABASAGLAR per day you will need and at what time, </li>
<li>tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, </li>
<li>tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of ABASAGLAR. </li>
</ul>
<p>ABASAGLAR is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-
acting insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. </p>
<p>Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
ABASAGLAR can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine 
exactly as your doctor has told you. </p>
<p>Frequency of administration 
You need one injection of ABASAGLAR every day, at the same time of the day. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
ABASAGLAR is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject ABASAGLAR in a vein, since this will 
change its action and may cause hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject ABASAGLAR. With each 
injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. </p>
<p>How to handle the cartridges 
The ABASAGLAR cartridges are to be used only in Lilly insulin pens to ensure you get the correct 
dose. Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. </p>
<p>The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided. </p>
<p>The instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the 
needle, and administering the insulin injection. </p>
<p>To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. </p>
<p>Look at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and water-like, 
and has no visible particles in it. Do not shake or mix it before use. </p>
<p>Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a 
problem with ABASAGLAR, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Special care before injection 
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). </p>
<p>Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. </p>
<p>Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. Do not mix 
ABASAGLAR with any other insulins or medicines. Do not dilute it. Mixing or diluting may change 
the action of ABASAGLAR. </p>
<p>Problems with the insulin pen? </p>
<p>Refer to the instructions for using the pen. </p>
<p>If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. </p>
<h2>If you use more ABASAGLAR than you should</h2>
<p>If you have injected too much ABASAGLAR or are unsure how much you have injected, your 
blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In 
general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For 
information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<h2>If you forget to use ABASAGLAR</h2>
<p>If you have missed a dose of ABASAGLAR or if you have not injected enough insulin or are 
unsure how much you have injected, your blood sugar level may become too high 
(hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on the treatment of 
hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
-<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>After injecting 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before deciding if 
you need another injection. </p>
<p>If you stop using ABASAGLAR 
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop ABASAGLAR without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>If you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take the action to increase 
your blood sugar levels immediately. Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious and is 
very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Low blood sugar means 
that there is not enough sugar in your blood. If your blood sugar level falls too low, you may pass out 
(become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. 
For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Severe allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)   the signs may include large-scale 
skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes 
(angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. Severe 
allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away if you notice 
signs of severe allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy, may affect up 
to 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy, may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis, how often 
they occur is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change 
the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) </p>
<ul>
<li>Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site </li>
</ul>
<p>The signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or 
inflammation. They can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually 
disappear in a few days to a few weeks. </p>
<p>Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) </p>
<ul>
<li>Eye reactions </li>
</ul>
<p>A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. </p>
<ul>
<li>General disorders </li>
</ul>
<p>In rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling 
in the calves and ankles. </p>
<p>Very rare side-effects (may affect up to1 in 10,000 people) 
In very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
In general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those 
seen in adults. </p>
<p>Complaints of injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions 
(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age 
or less than in adults. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
