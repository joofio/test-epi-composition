Abecma is a type of medicine called a  genetically modified cell therapy . The active substance in the 
medicine is idecabtagene vicleucel, which is made from your own white blood cells, called T cells. </p>
<p>What Abecma is used for 
Abecma is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the bone marrow. 
It is given when previous treatments for your cancer have not worked or the cancer has come back. </p>
<p>How Abecma works 
The white blood cells are taken from your blood and are genetically modified so that they can target 
the myeloma cells in your body. 
When Abecma is infused into your blood, the modified white blood cells will kill the myeloma cells. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you 
think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
* if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the medicines you will be given for 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which is used to prepare your body for Abecma treatment. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before you are given Abecma you should tell your doctor if 
* you have any lung or heart problems. 
* you have low blood pressure. 
* you have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months. 
* you have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease. This happens when transplanted cells 
attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody 
stools. 
* you have an infection. The infection will be treated before you are given Abecma. 
* you notice the symptoms of your cancer getting worse. In myeloma these might include fever, 
feeling weak, bone pain, unexplained weight loss. 
* you have had cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, hepatitis B or C or human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection. 
* you have had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few 
months. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given Abecma. </p>
<p>Tests and checks 
Before you are given Abecma your doctor will: 
* Check your lungs, heart and blood pressure. 
* Look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given Abecma. 
* Check if your cancer is getting worse. 
* Check for CMV infection, hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection. </p>
<p>After you have been given Abecma 
* There are serious side effects which you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight away 
and which may require you to get immediate medical attention. See section 4 under  Serious 
side effects . 
* Your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells may decrease. 
* Stay close to the treatment centre where you had Abecma for at least 4 weeks. See sections 3 
and 4. * Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Abecma should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Abecma 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Medicines that affect your immune system 
Before you are given Abecma, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
your immune system such as corticosteroids. This is because these medicines may interfere with the 
effect of Abecma. </p>
<p>See section 3 for information about the medicines you will be given before having Abecma. </p>
<p>Vaccinations 
You must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
* in the 6 weeks before you are given a short course of chemotherapy (called lympodepleting 
chemotherapy) to prepare your body for Abecma. 
* during Abecma treatment. 
* after treatment while the immune system is recovering. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. This is because the effects of Abecma in 
pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known and it may harm your unborn baby or breast-fed 
child. 
* If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Abecma, talk to your 
doctor immediately. 
* You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Abecma should only be given if the 
results show you are not pregnant. </p>
<p>Discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Abecma. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, use machines or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 8 weeks after 
treatment or until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered. Abecma may make you 
feel sleepy, may cause confusion or fits (seizures). </p>
<p>Abecma contains sodium, potassium and dimethly sulfoxide (DMSO) 
This medicine contains up to 752 mg sodium (main component of cooking/ table salt) per dose. This is 
equivalent to 37.6% of the recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains up to 274 mg potassium per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients 
with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet. </p>
<p>If you have not been previously exposed to DMSO you should be observed closely during the first 
minutes of the infusion period. </p>         </div>"""

* Your doctor will take some of your blood using a tube (catheter) in your vein. Some of your 
white blood cells will be separated from your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to 
your body. This is called  leukapheresis  and can take 3 to 6 hours. This process may need to be 
repeated. 
* Your white blood cells will then be frozen and sent away to make Abecma. </p>
<p>Other medicines you will be given before Abecma 
* A few days before you receive Abecma, you will be given a short course of chemotherapy. This 
is to clear away your existing white blood cells. 
* Shortly before you receive Abecma, you will be given paracetamol and an antihistamine 
medicine. This is to reduce the risk of infusion reactions and fever. </p>
<p>How Abecma is given 
* Your doctor will check that the Abecma was prepared from your own blood by checking the 
patient identity information on the medicine labels matches your details. 
* Abecma is given as an infusion drip through a tube into your vein. </p>
<p>After Abecma is given 
* Stay close to the treatment centre where you received Abecma - for at least 4 weeks. 
* You may be monitored daily in the treatment centre for at least 10 days to check if your 
treatment is working - and help you if you have any side effects. See sections 2 and 4. * Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. </p>

phosphate or albumin, which may cause fatigue, muscle weakness or cramps or an irregular 
heartbeat

damage in the body
