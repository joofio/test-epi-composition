Abraxane contains, as its active substance, paclitaxel attached to the human protein albumin, in the form 
of tiny particles known as nanoparticles. Paclitaxel belongs to a group of medicines called  taxanes  used 
in cancer. 
* Paclitaxel is the part of the medicine that affects the cancer, it works by stopping cancer cells from 
dividing   this means that they die. 
* Albumin is the part of the medicine that helps paclitaxel dissolve in the blood and get across the 
walls of the blood vessels into the tumour. This means that other chemicals that can cause side 
effects that can be life threatening are not needed. Such side effects occur far less with Abraxane. </p>
<p>What Abraxane is used for 
Abraxane is used to treat the following types of cancer: </p>
<p>Breast Cancer 
* Breast cancer which has spread to other parts of the body (this is called  metastatic  breast cancer). 
* Abraxane is used in metastatic breast cancer when at least one other therapy has been tried but has 
not worked and you are unsuitable for treatments containing a group of medicines called 
 anthracyclines . 
* People with metastatic breast cancer who received Abraxane where another therapy had failed, were 
more likely to experience a reduction in tumour size, and lived longer than people who took an 
alternative therapy. </p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer 
* Abraxane is used together with a medicine called gemcitabine if you have metastatic cancer of the 
pancreas. People with metastatic pancreatic cancer (pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts 
of the body) who received Abraxane with gemcitabine in a clinical trial lived longer than people 
who had only received gemcitabine. </p>
<p>Lung Cancer 
* Abraxane is also used together with a medicine called carboplatin if you have the most common 
type of lung cancer, called  non-small cell lung cancer . 
* Abraxane is used in non-small cell lung cancer where surgery or radiotherapy would not be suitable 
to treat the disease. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Pregnancy breast-feeding and fertility

doctor will arrange a pregnancy test before starting treatment with Abraxane. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving 
treatment with Abraxane. </p>

the mother s milk. </p>
<p>Male patients are advised to use effective contraception and to avoid fathering a child during and up to six 
months after treatment and should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the 
possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some people may feel tired or dizzy after being given Abraxane. If this happens to you, do not drive or use 
any tools or machines. </p>

driving and using machines. </p>
