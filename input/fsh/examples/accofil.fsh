<p>Accofil is a white blood cell growth factor (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) and belong to a 
group of medicines called cytokines. Growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally in the 
body but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. Accofil works by 
encouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. </p>
<p>A reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes 
your body less able to fight infection. Accofil stimulates the bone marrow to produce new white cells 
quickly. </p>
<p>Accofil can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent 
infections;  </li>
<li>to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent 
infections; </li>
<li>before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can 
be collected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from 
a donor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells;  </li>
<li>to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to 
help prevent infections;  </li>
<li>in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections.  </li>

<p>Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Accofil, if you: </p>
<p>Get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left 
shoulder (these may be symptoms of enlarge spleen (splenomegaly) or possibly rupture of 
spleen). </p>
<p>Notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets 
(thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot). </p>
<p>Have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives of skin, swelling of the face, lips, 
tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these 
could be a signs of severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity).   </p>
<p>Experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you 
notice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis). </p>
<p>have symptoms of inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from 
the heart to the body), this has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The 
symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory 
markers. Tell your doctor if youexperience these symptoms. </p>
<p>Loss of response to filgrastim 
If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your 
doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise filgrastim s activity. </p>
<p>Your doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. </p>
<p>If you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the 
blood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). You should talk to your doctor about your risks 
of developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to 
develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Accofil, unless instructed by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between 16 and 60 years. </p>
<p>Take special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells 
Accofil is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your 
healthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Accofil </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>

pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How is Accofil given and how much should I take? </p>
<p>Accofil is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a 
subcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an 
intravenous infusion). The usual dose varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will 
tell you how much Accofil you should take. </p>
<p>Patients having a bone marrow transplant after chemotherapy: 
You will normally receive your first dose of Accofil at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy and at 
least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. </p>
<p>You, or people caring for you, can be taught how to give subcutaneous injections so that you can 
continue your treatment at home. However, you should not attempt this unless you have been properly 
trained first by your health care provider. </p>
<p>How long will I have to take Accofil? </p>
<p>You will need to take Accofil until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood tests will be 
taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you how long you 
will need to take Accofil. </p>
<p>Use in children </p>
<p>Accofil is used to treat children who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from severe low white 
blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children receiving chemotherapy is the same as for 
adults. </p>
<p>Information for injecting yourself<br />
This section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Accofil. It is important that 
you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor 
or nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask 
your doctor or nurse for help. </p>
<p>How do I inject Accofil myself?<br />
You will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a 
subcutaneous injection. You will need to have your injections at about the same time every day. </p>
<p>Equipment that you need<br />
To give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  </p>
<p>a pre-filled syringe of Accofil; </p>
<p>alcohol swab or similar. </p>
<p>What should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Accofil?<br />
Ensure the needle cover remains on the syringe until just before you are ready to inject. 
a. 
Take your Accofil pre-filled syringe out of the refrigerator.<br />
b. 
Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed 
the last day of the month shown or if it has been kept outside of the refrigerator for more than days or has otherwise expired.<br />
c. 
Check the appearance of Accofil. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles in 
it, you must not use it.<br />
d. 
For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room 
temperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm 
Accofil in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).<br />
e. 
Wash your hands thoroughly.<br />
f. 
Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach them (the 
Accofil pre-filled syringe and alcohol swab). </p>
<p>How do I prepare my Accofil injection?<br />
Before you inject Accofil you must do the following:<br />
Do not use a pre-filled syringe if it has been dropped on a hard surface. </p>
<p>Step-1: Check the integrity of the system<br />
Ensure the system is intact/ not damaged. Do not use the product if you see any damage (syringe or 
needle safety guard breakage) or lose components and if the needle safety guard is on safety position 
before use as shown on picture 9 because this indicate system already operated. In general the product 
should not be used if it does not conform to the picture 1. If so discard the product in a biohazard 
(sharps) container.  </p>
<p>Picture 1 </p>
<p>Step 2: Remove the Needle Cap 
a. 
Remove the protective cap as shown in picture 2. Hold the body of the needle safety guard in one 
hand with the needle end pointing away from you and without touching the plunge rod. Pull the 
needle cap straight off with your other hand. After removal, throw away the needles cap in a 
biohazard (sharps) container. 
b. 
You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not have to remove the air 
bubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. 
c. 
The syringe may contain more liquid than you need. Use the scale on the syringe barrel as follows 
to set the correct dose of Accofil that your doctor prescribed. Eject unnecessary liquid by pushing 
the plunger up to the number (mL) on the syringe that matches the prescribed dose.<br />
d. 
Check again to make sure the correct dose of Accofil is in the syringe.<br />
e. 
You can now use the pre-filled syringe. </p>
<p>Picture 2 </p>
<p>Where should I give my injection?<br />
The most suitable places to inject yourself are:  </p>
<p>the top of your thighs; and  </p>
<p>the abdomen, except for the area around the navel (see picture 3). </p>
<p>Picture 3 </p>
<p>If someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms (see picture 4) </p>
<p>Picture 4 </p>
<p>It is better to change the injection site every day to avoid the risk of soreness at any one site.  </p>
<p>Step 3: Insert the Needle </p>
<ul>
<li>Lightly pinch the skin at the injection site with one hand;  </li>
<li>With the other hand insert the needle into the injection site without touching the plunger rod 
head (with 45-90 degree angle) (see picture 6 and 7). </li>
</ul>
<p>How do I give my injection?  </p>
<p>Disinfect the injection site by using an alcohol swab and pinch the skin between your thumb and 
forefinger, without squeezing it (see picture 5).  </p>
<p>Picture 5 </p>
<p>Pre-filled syringe without needle safety guard 
 * 
Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor (see picture 6).  * 
Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood 
in the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place.  * 
Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose 
has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. Do not release the pressure on 
the plunger. * 
Inject only the dose your doctor has told you. * 
After injecting the liquid, remove the needle while maintaining pressure on the plunger and then 
let go of your skin. * 
Put the used syringe in the disposal container. Use each syringe only for one injection. </p>
<p>Picture 6 </p>
<p>Pre-filled syringe with needle safety guard </p>
<ol>
<li>Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor.  </li>
<li>Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood 
in the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place.  </li>
<li>Inject only the dose your doctor has told you following the instructions below. </li>
</ol>
<p>Picture 7 </p>
<p>Step-4: Injection  </p>
<p>Place the thumb on the plunger rod head. Depress the plunger rod and push firmly at the end of the 
injection to ensure that syringe emptying is completed (see picture 8). Hold the skin securely until the 
injection is completed.   </p>
<p>Picture 8 </p>
<p>Step-5: Needle Stick Protection 
The safety system will activate once the plunger rod is fully depressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the syringe still and slowly lift your thumb from the plunger rod head; </li>
<li>The plunger rod will move up with your thumb and the spring retracts the needle from the site, into 
the Needle safety guard (see picture 9). </li>
</ul>
<p>Picture 9 </p>
<p>Remember<br />
If you have any problems, please do not be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.  </p>
<p>Disposing of used syringes<br />
The needle safety guard prevents needle stick injuries after use, so no special precautions for disposal 
are required. Dispose of the syringe as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you use more Accofil than you should </p>
<p>Do not increase the dose your doctor has given you. If you think you have injectedmore than you 
should, contact your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Accofil </p>
<p>If you have missed an injection, or injected too little, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for any missed doses. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment: 
  if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips, 
mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).<br />
  if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of Acute 
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).<br />
  if you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients who 
received filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or ankles, 
blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual 
  if you get left upper belly (abdonimal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your 
shoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) or 
rupture of the spleen).<br />
  if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine 
(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if protein 
is found in your urine (proteinuria). 
  If you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: swelling or puffiness, 
which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling 
and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a 
rapid fashion.  </p>
<p>These could be symptoms of a condition called  Capillary Leak Syndrome  which causes blood to 
leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention.  </p>

donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms 
of your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, 
lungs, vagina and joints.  </p>
<p>In normal stem cell donors an increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) and a decrease of platelets
