tablet. Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure. </p>
<ul>
<li>Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow 
thus increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the 
blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. </li>
<li>Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics, which cause your 
urine output to increase, leading to a lowering of your blood pressure. </li>
</ul>
<p>High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead 
sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms 
of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure 
to verify if it is within the normal range. </p>
<p>Actelsar HCT is used to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adults whose blood 
pressure is not controlled enough when telmisartan is used alone. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or to any other sulfonamide-derived medicines. 
- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Actelsar HCT in early 
pregnancy   see pregnancy section). 
- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease. 
- if you have severe kidney disease. 
- if your doctor determines that you have low potassium levels or high calcium levels in your 
blood that do not get better with treatment. 
- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren. </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Actelsar HCT. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of 
the following conditions or illnesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body 
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (water tablets), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, or haemodialysis. </li>
<li>Kidney disease or kidney transplant. </li>
<li>Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). </li>
<li>Liver disease. </li>
<li>Heart trouble. </li>
<li>Diabetes. </li>
<li>Gout. </li>
<li>Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various 
blood minerals). </li>
<li>Systemic lupus erythematosus (also called  lupus  or  SLE ) a disease where the body s 
immune system attacks the body. </li>
<li>The active substance hydrochlorothiazide can cause an unusual reaction, resulting in a decrease 
in vision and eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of 
the eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye and can happen within hours 
to weeks of taking Actelsar HCT. This can lead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. </li>
<li>if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase 
the risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin 
from sun exposure and UV rays while taking Actelsar HCT  </li>
<li>if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath 
or difficulty breathing after taking Actelsar HCT, seek medical attention immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT, if you are taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. </p>
</li>
<li>aliskiren. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes 
(e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading  Do 
not take Actelsar HCT . </li>
<li>digoxin. </li>
</ul>
<p>You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Actelsar HCT is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). </p>
<p>Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance in your body. Typical symptoms 
of fluid or electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, 
muscle pain or cramps, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tired muscles, and an abnormally fast heart 
rate (faster than 100 beats per minute). If you experience any of these you should tell your doctor. </p>
<p>You should also tell your doctor if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with 
symptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than 
normal. </p>
<p>In case of surgery or anaesthetics, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Actelsar HCT. </p>
<p>Actelsar HCT may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of Actelsar HCT in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Actelsar HCT </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other 
precautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially 
to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Actelsar HCT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. </li>
<li>Medicines associated with low blood potassium (hypokalaemia) such as other diuretics, ( water 
tablets ), laxatives (e.g. castor oil), corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), ACTH (a hormone), 
amphotericin (an antifungal medicine), carbenoxolone (used to treat mouth ulcers), penicillin G 
sodium (an antibiotic), and salicylic acid and derivatives. </li>
<li>Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, ACE inhibitors, cyclosporin (an 
immunosuppressant drug) and other medicinal products such as heparin sodium (an 
anticoagulant). </li>
<li>Medicines that are affected by changes of the blood potassium level such as heart medicines 
(e.g. digoxin) or medicines to control the rhythm of your heart (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, 
amiodarone, sotalol), medicines used for mental disorders (e.g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, 
levomepromazine) and other medicines such as certain antibiotics (e.g. sparfloxacine, 
pentamidine) or certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine). </li>
<li>Medicines for the treatment of diabetes (insulins or oral agents such as metformin). </li>
<li>Cholestyramine and colestipol, medicines for lowering blood fat levels. </li>
<li>Medicines to increase blood pressure, such as noradrenaline. </li>
<li>Muscle relaxing medicines, such as tubocurarine. </li>
<li>Calcium supplements and/or vitamin D supplements. </li>
<li>Anti-cholinergic medicines (medicines used to treat a variety of disorders such as 
gastrointestinal cramps, urinary bladder spasm, asthma, motion sickness, muscular spasms, 
Parkinson's disease and as an aid to anaesthesia) such as atropine and biperiden. </li>
<li>Amantadine (medicine used to treat Parkinson s disease and also used to treat or prevent certain 
illnesses caused by viruses). </li>
<li>Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, corticosteroids, painkillers (such as non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), medicines to treat cancer, gout, or arthritis. </li>
<li>If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not 
take Actelsar HCT  and  Warnings and precautions ). </li>
<li>Digoxin. </li>
</ul>
<p>Actelsar HCT may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high 
blood pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). 
Furthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or 
antidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your 
doctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Actelsar HCT. </p>
<p>The effect of Actelsar HCT may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines, e.g. acetylsalicyl acid or ibuprofen). </p>
<p>Actelsar HCT with food and alcohol </p>
<p>You can take Actelsar HCT with or without food. 
Avoid taking alcohol until you have talked to your doctor. Alcohol may make your blood pressure fall 
more and/or increase the risk of you becoming dizzy or feeling faint. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Actelsar HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Actelsar HCT. Actelsar HCT is not 
recommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Actelsar HCT is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some people feel dizzy or tired when taking Actelsar HCT. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or 
operate machinery. </p>
<p>Actelsar HCT contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
