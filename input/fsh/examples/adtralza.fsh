<p>Adtralza is used to treat adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Adtralza may be used with eczema medicines that you

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to tralokinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Adtralza. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Adtralza. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
Very rarely, medicines can cause allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and severe allergic reactions 
called anaphylaxis. You must look out for signs of these reactions (such as breathing problems, 
swelling of the face, mouth, and tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded (because of low blood 
pressure), hives, itching and skin rash) while you are using Adtralza. 
Stop using Adtralza and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs of an 
allergic reaction. Such signs are listed in the beginning of section 4. Parasitic infection in the intestines 
Adtralza may reduce your resistance to infections caused by parasites. Any parasitic infection should 
be treated before you start treatment with Adtralza. Tell your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset 
stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration which could be signs of a parasitic infection. If you live in a 
region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Eye problems 
Talk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in 
vision. </p>
<p>Children<br />
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 12 years because the safety and benefits of 
Adtralza are not yet known in this population. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Adtralza 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist 
- If you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
- If you have recently had a vaccination or are due to have one. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or you are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. The effects of Adtralza in pregnant women are 
not known; therefore, it is preferable to avoid using it during pregnancy unless your doctor advises 
you to use it. </p>
<p>If applicable, you and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Adtralza. You should 
not do both. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Adtralza is unlikely to reduce your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Adtralza contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 150 mg that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
