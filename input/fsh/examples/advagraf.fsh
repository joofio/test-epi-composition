- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of Advagraf (see 
section 6). 
- if you are allergic to sirolimus or to any macrolide-antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, josamycin). 
Warnings and precautions 
Prograf and Advagraf both contain the active substance, tacrolimus. However, Advagraf is taken once 
daily, whereas Prograf is taken twice daily. This is because Advagraf capsules allow for a prolonged 
release (more slow release over a longer period) of tacrolimus. Advagraf and Prograf are not 
interchangeable. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Advagraf:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are taking any medicines mentioned below under  Other medicines and Advagraf .  </li>
<li>if you have or have had liver problems. </li>
<li>
<p>if you have diarrhoea for more than one day. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you feel strong abdominal pain accompanied or not with other symptoms, such as chills, 
fever, nausea or vomiting. </p>
</li>
<li>if you have an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called  QT prolongation .  </li>
<li>if you have or have had damage to the smallest blood vessels, known as thrombotic 
microangiopathy/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Tell 
your doctor if you develop fever, bruising under the skin (which may appear as red dots), 
unexplained tiredness, confusion, yellowing of the skin or eyes, reduced urine output, vision 
loss and seizures (see section 4). When tacrolimus is taken together with sirolimus or 
everolimus, the risk of developing these symptoms may increase. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please avoid taking any herbal remedies, e.g., St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or any other 
herbal products as this may affect the effectiveness and the dose of Advagraf that you need to receive. 
If in doubt please consult your doctor prior to taking any herbal products or remedies. </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to adjust your dose of Advagraf. </p>
<p>You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do 
blood, urine, heart, eye tests, to set the right dose of Advagraf.  </p>
<p>You should limit your exposure to the sun and UV (ultraviolet) light whilst taking Advagraf. This is 
because immunosuppressants could increase the risk of skin cancer. Wear appropriate protective 
clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor.  </p>
<p>Precaution for handling: 
Direct contact with any part of your body like your skin or eyes, or breathing in of injection solutions, 
powder or granules contained in tacrolimus products should be avoided during preparation. If such 
contact occurs, wash the skin and eyes. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Advagraf is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years. 
Other medicines and Advagraf 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal preparations.  </p>
<p>It is not recommended that Advagraf is taken with ciclosporin (another medicine used for the 
prevention of transplant organ rejection). </p>
<p>If you need to attend a doctor other than your transplant specialist, tell the doctor that you are 
taking tacrolimus. Your doctor may need to consult your transplant specialist if you should use 
another medicine that could increase or decrease your tacrolimus blood level. </p>
<p>Advagraf blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other 
medicines can be affected by taking Advagraf, which may require interruption, an increase or a 
decrease in Advagraf dose.  </p>
<p>Some patients have experienced increases in tacrolimus blood levels while taking other medicines. 
This could lead to serious side effects, such as kidney problems, nervous system problems, and heart 
rhythm disturbances (see section 4).<br />
An effect on the Advagraf blood levels may occur very soon after starting the use of another medicine, 
therefore frequent continued monitoring of your Advagraf blood level may be needed within the first 
few days of starting another medicine and frequently while treatment with the other medicine 
continues. Some other medicines may cause tacrolimus blood levels to decrease, which could increase 
the risk of rejecting the transplanted organ. In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking 
or have recently taken medicines like:</p>
<ul>
<li>antifungal medicines and antibiotics, particularly so-called macrolide antibiotics, used to treat 
infections e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, </li>
</ul>
<p>clotrimazole, isavuconazole, miconazole, caspofungin, telithromycin, erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, josamycin, azithromycin, rifampicin, rifabutin, isoniazid and flucloxacillin 
- letermovir, used to prevent illness caused by CMV (human cytomegalovirus) 
- HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), the booster medicine cobicistat, 
and combination tablets, or HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz, 
etravirine, nevirapine) used to treat HIV infection 
- HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., telaprevir, boceprevir, the combination 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, and 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir), used to treat hepatitis C infection 
- nilotinib and imatinib, idelalisib, ceritinib, crizotinib, apalutamide, enzalutamide, or mitotane 
(used to treat certain cancers) 
- mycophenolic acid, used to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection 
- medicines for stomach ulcer and acid reflux (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole or cimetidine) 
- antiemetics, used to treat nausea and vomiting (e.g., metoclopramide) 
- cisapride or the antacid magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide, used to treat heartburn 
- the contraceptive pill or other hormone treatments with ethinylestradiol, hormone treatments with 
danazol 
- medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g., nifedipine, nicardipine, 
diltiazem and verapamil) 
- anti-arrhythmic drugs (amiodarone) used to control arrhythmia (uneven beating of the heart) 
- medicines known as  statins  used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides 
- carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy 
- metamizole, used to treat pain and fever 
- the corticosteroids prednisolone and methylprednisolone, belonging to the class of corticosteroids 
used to treat inflammations or suppress the immune system (e.g., in transplant rejection) 
- nefazodone, used to treat depression 
- herbal preparations containing St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or extracts of Schisandra 
sphenanthera 
- cannabidiol (uses amongst others include treatment of seizures). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are receiving treatment for hepatitis C. The drug treatment for hepatitis C may 
change your liver function and may affect blood levels of tacrolimus. Tacrolimus blood levels may fall 
or may increase depending on the medicines prescribed for hepatitis C. Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels and make necessary adjustments of Advagraf dose after you 
start treatment for hepatitis C. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking or need to take ibuprofen (used to treat fever, inflammation and 
pain), antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, vancomycin, or aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin), 
amphotericin B (used to treat fungal infections) or antivirals (used to treat viral infections e.g. 
acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet). These may worsen kidney or nervous system problems 
when taken together with Advagraf. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking sirolimus or everolimus. When tacrolimus is taken together with 
sirolimus or everolimus, the risk of developing thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura, and haemolytic uraemic syndrome may increase (see section 4). </p>
<p>Your doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or certain diuretics used for 
heart failure, hypertension and kidney disease, (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), or the 
antibiotics trimethoprim or cotrimoxazole that may increase levels of potassium in your blood, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. ibuprofen) used for fever, inflammation and pain, 
anticoagulants (blood thinners), or oral medicines for diabetes, while you take Advagraf. </p>
<p>If you need to have any vaccinations, please tell your doctor before. 
Advagraf with food and drink<br />
Avoid grapefruit (also as juice) while on treatment with Advagraf, since it can affect its levels in the 
blood. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are, think you might be or are planning to become pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before 
using Advagraf. 
Advagraf passes into breast milk. Therefore, you should not breast-feed whilst using Advagraf. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy or sleepy, or have problems seeing clearly 
after taking Advagraf. These effects are more frequent if you also drink alcohol. 
Advagraf contains lactose, sodium and lecithin (soya) 
Advagraf contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . 
The printing ink used on Advagraf capsules contains soya lecithin. If you are allergic to peanut or 
soya, talk to your doctor to determine whether you should use this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

unless your transplant specialist has agreed to change to a different tacrolimus medicine. This 
medicine should be taken once a day. If the appearance of this medicine is not the same as usual, or if 
dosage instructions have changed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible to make sure 
that you have the right medicine. </p>
<p>The starting dose to prevent the rejection of your transplanted organ will be determined by your doctor 
calculated according to your body weight. Initial daily doses just after transplantation will generally be 
in the range of  </p>
<p>0.10   0.30 mg per kg body weight per day </p>
<p>depending on the transplanted organ. When treating rejection, these same doses may be used. </p>
<p>Your dose depends on your general condition and on which other immunosuppressive medication you 
are taking.  </p>
<p>Following the initiation of your treatment with Advagraf, frequent blood tests will be taken by your 
doctor to define the correct dose. Afterwards regular blood tests by your doctor will be required to 
define the correct dose and to adjust the dose from time to time. Your doctor will usually reduce your 
Advagraf dose once your condition has stabilised. Your doctor will tell you exactly how many 
capsules to take. </p>
<p>You will need to take Advagraf every day as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent rejection 
of your transplanted organ. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. </p>
<p>Advagraf is taken orally once daily in the morning. Take Advagraf on an empty stomach or 
2 to 3 hours after a meal. Wait at least 1 hour until the next meal. Take the capsules immediately 
following removal from the blister. The capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do 
not swallow the desiccant contained in the foil wrapper.
