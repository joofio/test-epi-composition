ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with

If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously 
treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher 
risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy 
of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the 
treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor 
immediately.
There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, 
wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in 
the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early 
symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme 
dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.
Patients developing Factor VIII inhibitors
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child s bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.
Children and adolescents
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).
Other medicines and ADVATE
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
ADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.
ADVATE contains sodium
This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 
0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your 
condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The 
frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the 
replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.
Prevention of bleeding
The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. 
However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may 
be necessary.
Treatment of bleeding
The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor.
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.
Use in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age)
For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the 
prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 
4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does 
not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become 
necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.
How ADVATE is given
ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else 
might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed 
instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.
If you use more ADVATE than you should
Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to use ADVATE
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.
If you stop using ADVATE
Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""

may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous 
treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in people). If this happens your or your child s medicines may stop working properly and you or your 
child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately.

general disorders (tiredness, lack of energy).
Additional side effects in children
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in side effects were noted in the clinical 
studies.
Reporting of side effects
