Aerinaze tablets contain a combination of two active ingredients, desloratadine which is an 
antihistamine and pseudoephedrine sulphate which is a decongestant.  </p>
<p>How Aerinaze works 
Antihistamines help to reduce allergic symptoms by preventing the effects of a substance called 
histamine, which is produced by the body. Decongestants help to clear nasal congestion 
(blocked/stuffy nose). </p>
<p>When Aerinaze should be used 
Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as, 
sneezing, runny or itchy nose, and eyes, when accompanied by nasal congestion in adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine sulphate, adrenergic medicines, or any of 
the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) or to loratadine </li>
<li>if you have high blood pressure, heart or blood vessel disease or a history of stroke </li>
<li>if you have glaucoma, difficulty in urinating, urinary tract blockage, or an overactive thyroid </li>
<li>if you are taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (a class of antidepressant medicines) 
therapy or have stopped taking these types of medicines within the last 14 days. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Certain conditions may make you unusually sensitive to the decongestant pseudoephedrine sulphate 
contained in this medicine. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Aerinaze:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are 60 years of age or older. Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of this 
medicine </li>
<li>if you have diabetes  </li>
<li>if you have intestinal ulcers leading to the narrowing of the stomach, small intestine or 
esophagus (stenosing peptic ulcer) </li>
<li>if you have intestinal blockage (pyloral or duodenal blockage)  </li>
<li>if you have bladder neck blockage (vesical cervix blockage) </li>
<li>if you have a history of difficulty breathing due to tightening of the lung muscles 
(bronchospasm) </li>
<li>if you have problems with your liver, kidney, or bladder. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you experience or are diagnosed with any of the following conditions you should talk to 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as they may advise you to stop taking Aerinaze:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure </li>
<li>a fast or pounding heart beat </li>
<li>abnormal heart rhythm </li>
<li>feeling sick and headache or increase headache while using Aerinaze.  </li>
<li>if you have medical of familial history of seizures </li>
<li>severe skin reactions, including signs and symptoms such as reddening of the skin, many small 
pimples, with or without fever  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are scheduled to have surgery, your doctor may advise you to stop taking Aerinaze 24 hours 
beforehand. </p>
<p>One of the active ingredients in Aerinaze, pseudoephedrine sulphate, has the potential to be abused 
and large doses of pseudoephedrine sulphate can be toxic. Continuous use may lead to taking more 
Aerinaze than the recommended dose to get the desired effect, resulting in an increased risk of 
overdosing. If you suddenly stop treatment, depression may occur. </p>
<p>Laboratory tests 
Stop taking Aerinaze at least 48 hours before you have any skin tests since antihistamines may 
influence the result of the skin test. 
Athletes taking Aerinaze may have positive doping-tests. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children less than 12 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Aerinaze

medicines. This is especially important if you are taking:</p>

<li>medicines for blood pressure (e.g.  -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids
