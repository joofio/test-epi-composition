outbreaks of zoonotic influenza viruses (coming from birds) with pandemic potential to prevent flu 
caused by H5N1 viruses similar to the vaccine strain reported in section 6. Zoonotic influenza viruses occasionally infect humans, and can cause disease ranging from mild upper 
respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, shock and even death. Human infections are primarily caused by contact with 
infected animals, but do not spread easily between people. </p>
<p>AFLUNOV is intended also to be given when there is anticipation of a possible pandemic due to the 
same or a similar strain. </p>
<p>When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine 
can cause flu. </p>
<p>As with all vaccines, AFLUNOV may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. </p>         </div>"""

AFLUNOV (listed in section 6) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts 
as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, kanamycin and neomycin 
sulphate (antibiotics), hydrocortisone or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Signs of an 
allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or 
tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to be vaccinated with 
AFLUNOV provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an 
allergic reaction. </li>

hydrocortisone or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (see section 6. Further 
information); </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a severe infection with fever (over 38 C). If this applies to you then your 
vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a 
cold should not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could still be 
vaccinated with AFLUNOV; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first 
few weeks after vaccination with AFLUNOV the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell 
the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given AFLUNOV. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the presence of immune deficiencies AFLUNOV may be administered but a protective 
immune response may not be elicited. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. </p>
<p>Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if 
you fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>AFLUNOV may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those 
with weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical 
problems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak 
immune system or an underlying long term medical problem.  </p>
<p>In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, 
or may need to be delayed. </p>
<p>Other medicines and AFLUNOV </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Data obtained in adults showed that AFLUNOV can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted 
seasonal influenza vaccines. There is no information on administration of AFLUNOV with non-
influenza vaccines. If administration of AFLUNOV with other vaccines can not be avoided, the 
vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should be aware that the side 
effects may be more intense. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before receiving this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits 
and potential risks of giving you the vaccine.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Some effects mentioned under section 4.  Possible side effects  may affect the ability to drive or use 
machines. </p>
<p>AFLUNOV contains sodium and potassium. </p>
<p>AFLUNOV contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) 
per 0.5 ml dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free. </p>         </div>"""
