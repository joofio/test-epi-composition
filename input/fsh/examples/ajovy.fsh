AJOVY is a medicine containing the active substance fremanezumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type 
of protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target in the body.  </p>
<p>How AJOVY works 
A substance in the body called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in 
migraine. Fremanezumab attaches to CGRP and prevents it from working. This reduction in CGRP's 
activity reduces migraine attacks. </p>
<p>What AJOVY is used for 
AJOVY is used to prevent migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. </p>
<p>What are the benefits of using AJOVY 
AJOVY reduces the frequency of migraine attacks and days with headache. This medicine also 
decreases the disability associated with migraine and it reduces the need for medicines used to treat 
migraine attacks. </p>         </div>"""
