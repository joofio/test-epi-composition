in two different ways.
Akeega is used to treat adult men with prostate cancer who have changes in certain genes and whose 
prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the body and no longer responds to medical or surgical 
treatment that lowers testosterone (also called metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer).
Niraparib is a type of cancer medicine called a PARP inhibitor. PARP inhibitors block an enzyme 
called poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase (PARP). PARP helps cells repair damaged 
DNA. When PARP is blocked, cancer cells cannot repair their DNA, resulting in tumour cell death
and helping to control the cancer.
Abiraterone stops your body from making testosterone; this can slow the growth of prostate cancer.
When you take this medicine, your doctor will also prescribe another medicine called prednisone or 
prednisolone. This is to lower your chances of getting high blood pressure, having too much water in 
your body (fluid retention), or having reduced levels of a chemical known as potassium in your blood.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to niraparib or abiraterone acetate or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine - listed in section 6.<br />
if you are a woman who is or can become pregnant.</p>
<p>if you have severe liver damage.</p>
<p>in combination with Ra-223 treatment (which is used to treat prostate cancer). This is because 
of a possible increase in the risk of bone fracture or death.
Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before or while taking this medicine if you have:</p>
<p>low blood cell counts. Signs and symptoms you need to look out for include fatigue, fever or 
infection, and abnormal bruising or bleeding. Akeega may also lower your blood cell counts. 
Your doctor will test your blood regularly throughout your treatment.</p>
<p>high blood pressure or heart failure or low blood potassium (low blood potassium may increase 
the risk of heart rhythm problems), have had other heart or blood vessel problems, have an 
irregular or rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, gained weight rapidly, or swelling in the feet, 
ankles, or legs. Your doctor will measure your blood pressure regularly throughout your 
treatment.</p>
<p>headaches, vision changes, confusion, or seizure. These may be signs of a rare neurological side 
effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) that has been associated 
with use of niraparib, an active ingredient of Akeega.</p>
<p>high fever, fatigue and other signs and symptoms of severe infection.</p>
<p>blood clots in the lungs, or have had them in the past.</p>
<p>liver problems.</p>
<p>low or high levels of sugar in the blood.</p>
<p>muscle weakness and/or muscle pain.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
this medicine.
If you develop low blood-cell counts for a long period of time while taking Akeega, this may be a sign 
of more serious problems with the bone marrow such as  myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS) or  acute 
myeloid leukaemia  (AML). Your doctor may want to test your bone marrow to check for these 
problems.
Before taking Akeega, also talk to your doctor or pharmacist about:</p>
<p>the effect Akeega may have on your bones.</p>
<p>taking prednisone or prednisolone (another medicine you must take with Akeega)
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this 
medicine.
Blood monitoring
Akeega may affect your liver, but you may not notice any symptoms of liver problems. When you are 
taking this medicine, your doctor will therefore check your blood periodically to look for any effects 
on your liver.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. If Akeega is accidentally swallowed by a 
child or adolescent, take them to the hospital immediately and take this package leaflet with you to 
show to the emergency doctor.
Other medicines and Akeega
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Akeega can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other 
medicines can affect the way Akeega works.
Treatment with medicines that stop the body from producing testosterone, may increase the risk of 
heart rhythm problems. Tell your doctor if you are receiving medicine:</p>
<p>to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol);</p>
<p>known to increase the risk of heart rhythm problems (e.g., methadone), used for pain relief and 
part of drug addiction detoxification; moxifloxacin, an antibiotic; antipsychotics, used for 
serious mental illnesses.
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.
Akeega with food</p>
<p>This medicine must not be taken with food (see section 3,  Taking Akeega ), as this may 
increase your risk of side effects.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Akeega is not for use in women.</p>
<p>This medicine may cause harm to the unborn child if it is taken by women who are pregnant.</p>
<p>Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should wear gloves if they need to 
touch or handle Akeega.
Contraception for men using Akeega</p>
<p>If you are having sex with a woman who can become pregnant, use a condom and another 
effective birth control method. Use contraception during treatment and for 4 months after 
stopping. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about contraception.</p>
<p>If you are having sex with a pregnant woman, use a condom to protect the unborn child.
Driving and using machines
Taking Akeega may make you feel weak, unfocused, tired or dizzy. This may influence your ability to 
drive and use machines. Use caution when driving or using machines.
Akeega contains lactose and sodium</p>
<p>Akeega contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.</p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""
