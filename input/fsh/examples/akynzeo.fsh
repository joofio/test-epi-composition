Akynzeo contains two medicines ( active substances ) called: 
* netupitant 
* palonosetron. </p>
<p>What Akynzeo is used for 
Akynzeo is used to help prevent adults with cancer feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) 
while having cancer treatment called  chemotherapy . </p>
<p>How Akynzeo works 
Chemotherapy medicines can cause the body to release substances called serotonin and substance P. 
This stimulates the vomiting centre in the brain, making you feel or be sick.  The medicines in 
Akynzeo attach to the receptors in the nervous system through which serotonin and substance P work: 
netupitant (an NK1 receptor antagonist) blocks the receptors for substance P, and palonosetron (a 5-
HT3 receptor antagonist) blocks certain receptors for serotonin. By blocking the actions of substance P 
and serotonin in this way, the medicines help prevent the stimulation of the vomiting centre and the 
resulting sickness. </p>         </div>"""
