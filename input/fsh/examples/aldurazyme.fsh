the non-neurological manifestations of the disease. </p>
<p>People with MPS I disease have either a low level or no level of an enzyme called  -L-iduronidase, 
which breaks down specific substances (glycosaminoglycans) in the body. As a result, these 
substances do not get broken down and processed by the body as they should. They accumulate in 
many tissues in the body, which causes the symptoms of MPS I. </p>
<p>Aldurazyme is an artificial enzyme called laronidase. This can replace the natural enzyme which is 
lacking in MPS I disease. </p>         </div>"""

If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to laronidase or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Aldurazyme.<br />
Contact your doctor immediately if treatment with Aldurazyme causes: 
     Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (a severe allergy reaction)   see under section 4. Possible side effects . Some of these reactions may be life-threatening. Symptoms may 
include respiratory failure/distress (inability of lungs to work properly), stridor (high-pitched 
breathing sound) and other disorders due to obstruction of airways, rapid breathing, excessive 
contraction of the airway muscles causing breathing difficulty (bronchospasm), lack of oxygen 
in body tissues (hypoxia), low blood pressure, slow heart rate, or itchy rash (urticaria).  </p>
<pre><code> Infusion-associated reactions, i.e. any side effect occurring during the infusion or until the end
</code></pre>
<p>of the infusion day- see under section 4  Possible Side Effects  below for symptoms.  </p>
<p>If these reactions occur, the Aldurazyme infusion should be stopped immediately and appropriate 
treatment will be started by your doctor.<br />
These reactions may be particularly severe if you have a pre-existing MPS I-related upper airway 
obstruction. 
You may be given additional medications to help prevent allergic-type reactions, such as 
antihistamines, medicine to reduce fever (e.g. paracetamol) and/or corticosteroids. 
Your doctor will also decide if you can continue receiving Aldurazyme. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Aldurazyme 
Inform your doctor if you are using medicines containing chloroquine or procaine, due to a possible 
risk of decreasing the action of Aldurazyme. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
There is not enough experience of the use of Aldurazyme in pregnant women. You should not be 
given Aldurazyme during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
It is not known whether Aldurazyme appears in breast milk. It is recommended to stop breast-feeding 
during treatment with Aldurazyme. 
No information is available on the effects of Aldurazyme on fertility. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
The effects on the ability to drive and to use machines have not been studied. </p>
<p>Aldurazyme contains sodium 
This medicine contains 30 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per vial. This is 
equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

The concentrate for solution for infusion has to be diluted before administration and is for intravenous 
use (see information for health care professionals). 
Administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where 
resuscitation equipment to manage medical emergencies would be readily available. </p>
<p>Home infusion 
Your doctor may consider that you can have home infusion of Aldurazyme if it is safe and convenient 
to do so. If you get a side effect during an infusion of Aldurazyme, your infusion staff member may 
stop the infusion and start appropriate medical treatment. </p>
<p>Dosage 
The recommended dosage regimen of Aldurazyme is 100 U/kg body weight given once every week as 
an intravenous infusion. The initial infusion rate of 2 U/kg/h may be gradually increased every fifteen 
minutes, if tolerated, to a maximum of 43 U/kg/h. The total volume of the administration should be 
delivered in approximately 3-4 hours.  </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>If you miss an infusion of Aldurazyme<br />
If you have missed an Aldurazyme infusion, please contact your doctor.<br />
If you are given more Aldurazyme than needed 
If the dose of Aldurazyme given is too high or the infusion is too fast, adverse drug reactions may 
occur. Receiving an excessively fast infusion of Aldurazyme may cause nausea, abdominal pain, 
headache, dizziness and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea). In such situations, the infusion should be 
stopped or the infusion rate slowed down immediately. Your doctor will decide if further intervention 
is required. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Side effects were mainly seen while patients were being given the medicine or shortly after (infusion-
associated reactions). If you experience any reaction like this, you should contact your doctor 
immediately. The number of these reactions decreased the longer that patients were on Aldurazyme. 
The majority of these reactions were mild or moderate in intensity. However, severe systemic allergic 
reaction (anaphylactic reaction) has been observed in patients during or up to 3 hours after 
Aldurazyme infusions. Some of the symptoms of such a severe allergic reaction were life-threatening 
and included extreme difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat, low blood pressure, and low oxygen 
level in the body. A few patients who had a prior history of severe MPS I related upper airway and 
pulmonary involvement, experienced severe reactions including bronchospasm (airway constriction), 
respiratory arrest, and swelling of the face. The frequency of bronchospasm and respiratory arrest is 
unknown. The frequency of severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) and swelling of the face is 
considered common and may affect up to 1 in 10 people. </p>
