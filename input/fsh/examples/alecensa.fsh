<p>Alecensa is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance alectinib. </p>
<p>What Alecensa is used for </p>
<p>Alecensa is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called  non-small cell lung cancer<br />
( NSCLC ). It is used if your lung cancer: 
  is  ALK-positive  - this means your cancer cells have a fault in a gene that makes an enzyme called 
ALK ( anaplastic lymphoma kinase ), see  How Alecensa works , below 
  and is advanced. </p>
<p>Alecensa can be prescribed to you as first treatment of your lung cancer, or if you have been 
previously treated with a medicine containing  crizotinib . </p>
<p>How Alecensa works </p>
<p>Alecensa blocks the action of an enzyme called  ALK tyrosine kinase . Abnormal forms of this 
enzyme (due to fault in the gene that makes it) help encourage cancer cell growth. Alecensa may slow 
down or stop the growth of your cancer. It may also help to shrink your cancer. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Alecensa works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

  if you have ever had stomach or intestine problems as holes (perforation), or if you have conditions 
causing inflammation inside the abdomen (diverticulitis), or if you have spread of cancer inside the
