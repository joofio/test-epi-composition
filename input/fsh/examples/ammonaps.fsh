have a deficiency of certain liver enzymes and are therefore unable to eliminate nitrogen waste. 
Nitrogen is a building block of proteins, because of this, there is a build up of nitrogen in the body 
after eating protein. Nitrogen waste, in the form of ammonia, is especially toxic for the brain and 
leads, in severe cases, to reduced levels of consciousness and to coma.  </p>
<p>AMMONAPS helps the body to eliminate nitrogen waste, reducing the amount of ammonia in your 
body. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are pregnant. 
- if you are breast-feeding. 
- if you are allergic to sodium phenylbutyrate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking AMMONAPS 
-<br />
if you have difficulty swallowing. AMMONAPS tablets can get stuck in the oesophagus and 
cause ulcers. If you have difficulty swallowing it is recommended to use AMMONAPS 
granules instead. 
- if you suffer from heart failure, a decrease in your kidney function or other diseases, where the 
retention of the sodium salt contained in this medicine, may make your condition worse. 
- if you have decreased kidney or liver function, since AMMONAPS is eliminated from the body 
through the kidney and liver. 
- when given to small children, since they may not be able to swallow the tablets and may choke. 
It is recommended to use AMMONAPS granules instead. </p>
<p>AMMONAPS must be combined with a diet reduced in proteins designed especially for you by the 
doctor and the dietician. You must follow this diet carefully. 
AMMONAPS does not completely prevent the occurrence of an acute excess of ammonia in the blood 
and is not appropriate for treating such a condition, which is a medical emergency. </p>
<p>If you require laboratory tests, it is important to remind your doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, 
since sodium phenylbutyrate may influence certain laboratory test results. </p>
<p>Other medicines and AMMONAPS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>valproic acid (an antiepileptic drug),  </li>
<li>haloperidol (used in certain psychotic disorders),  </li>
<li>corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines that are used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the 
body),  </li>
<li>probenecid (for treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout). </li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines may change the effect of AMMONAPS and you will need more frequent blood 
controls. If you are uncertain if your medicines contain these substances, you should check with your 
doctor or pharmacist.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use AMMONAPS if you are pregnant, because this medicine can harm your unborn baby. If 
you are a woman who could get pregnant, you must use reliable contraception, during treatment with 
AMMONAPS. 
Do not use AMMONAPS if you are breast-feeding, because this medicine can pass into the breast-
milk and harm your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. </p>
<p>AMMONAPS contains sodium 
Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg of sodium.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you need 6 or more tablets daily for a prolonged period, especially 
if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.  </p>         </div>"""

if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Dosage 
The daily dose of AMMONAPS will be calculated from your protein tolerance, diet and body weight 
or body surface. You will need regular blood tests to determine the correct daily dose. Your doctor 
will tell you how many tablets you should take.  </p>
<p>Method of administration 
You should take AMMONAPS by mouth in equally divided doses with each meal (for example three 
times per day). You should take AMMONAPS with a large volume of water. </p>
<p>AMMONAPS must be taken with a special diet reduced in protein. </p>
<p>AMMONAPS tablets should not be given to children who are not able to swallow tablets. It is 
recommended that AMMONAPS granules are used instead. </p>
<p>You will need to have treatment and to follow a diet throughout your life, unless you have a successful 
liver transplantation. </p>
<p>If you take more AMMONAPS than you should 
Patients who have taken very high doses of AMMONAPS experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li>sleepiness, tiredness, light-headedness and less frequently confusion,  </li>
<li>headache,  </li>
<li>changes in taste (taste disturbances),  </li>
<li>decrease in hearing,  </li>
<li>disorientation,  </li>
<li>impaired memory, </li>
<li>worsening of existing neurological conditions. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should immediately contact your doctor or the nearest 
hospital emergency department for supportive treatment. </p>
<p>If you forget to take AMMONAPS 
You should take a dose as soon as possible with your next meal. Make sure that there are at least 
3 hours between two doses. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
