  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Amsparity contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your child s body s 
immune (defence) system. </p>
<p>Amsparity is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
* polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
* paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis 
* paediatric plaque psoriasis 
* paediatric Crohn s disease 
* paediatric uveitis </p>
<p>The active ingredient in Amsparity, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are 
proteins that attach to a specific target in the body. </p>
<p>The target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is involved 
in the immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed 
above. By attaching to TNF , Amsparity blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these 
diseases. </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that usually first 
appears in childhood. </p>
<p>Amsparity is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 
to 17 years. Your child may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If 
these medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Amsparity to treat his/her 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. </p>
<p>Paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis </p>
<p>Paediatric enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where 
tendons join the bone. </p>
<p>Amsparity is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. 
Your child may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these 
medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Amsparity to treat his/her 
enthesitis-related arthritis. </p>
<p>Paediatric plaque psoriasis </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin 
covered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, 
become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be 
caused by a problem with the body s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin 
cells. </p>
<p>Amsparity is used to treat severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 
17 years for whom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked 
very well or are not suitable. </p>
<p>Paediatric Crohn s disease </p>
<p>Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. </p>
<p>Amsparity is used to treat Crohn s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. </p>
<p>If your child has Crohn s disease, your child will first be given other medicines. If your child does not 
respond well enough to these medicines, your child will be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and 
symptoms of his/her Crohn s disease. </p>
<p>Paediatric uveitis </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation 
may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines 
that move across the field of vision). Amsparity works by reducing this inflammation. </p>
<p>Amsparity is used to treat children and adolescents with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of 
age with inflammation affecting the front of the eye. </p>
<p>Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child 
will be given Amsparity to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>
<p>if your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if your child has a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or 
opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is 
important that you tell your child s doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, for example, 
fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your child s doctor if 
your child has had or has a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your child s doctor or pharmacist before using Amsparity.  </p>
<p>It is important that you and your child s doctor record the brand name and batch number of your 
child s medication. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions </p>
<ul>
<li>If your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash, do not inject more Amsparity and contact your child s doctor immediately, 
since in rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infections </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your child has an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the 
body (for example, leg ulcer), consult your child s doctor before starting Amsparity. If you are 
unsure, contact your child s doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving Amsparity treatment. This 
risk may increase if your child has problems with his/her lungs. These infections may be serious 
and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other 
opportunistic infections (unusual infectious organisms), and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare 
cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your child s doctor if your 
child gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your child s doctor 
may recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your child s 
doctor will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Amsparity. 
This will include a thorough medical evaluation including your child s medical history and 
screening tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these 
tests should be recorded on your child s patient reminder card. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is very important that you tell your child s doctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if 
he/she has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If your child has active 
tuberculosis, do not use Amsparity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child had treatment for the prevention of 
tuberculosis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack of 
energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your child s doctor 
immediately. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Travel / recurrent infection </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell your child s doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections 
such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic (found). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your child s doctor if your child has had infections which keep coming back or other 
conditions that increase the risk of infections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You and your child s doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while your child is 
being treated with Amsparity. It is important to tell your child s doctor if your child gets 
symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis B </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your child s doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has 
active HBV infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of getting HBV. Your child s doctor 
should test your child for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry 
the virus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the 
immune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Surgery or dental procedure </p>
<ul>
<li>If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your child s doctor that he/she is 
taking Amsparity. Your child s doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Amsparity. </li>
</ul>
<p>Demyelinating disease </p>
<ul>
<li>If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer 
around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your child s doctor will decide if he/she should 
receive or continue to receive Amsparity. Tell your child s doctor immediately if your child gets 
symptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part 
of the body. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccination </p>
<ul>
<li>Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that 
may cause infections and should not be given during treatment with Amsparity. Check with your 
child s doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, 
children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with 
Amsparity. If your child received Amsparity while she was pregnant, her baby may be at higher 
risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last Amsparity dose she 
received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care 
professionals about your child s Amsparity use during her pregnancy so they can decide when 
her baby should receive any vaccine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Heart failure </p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to tell your child s doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. If 
your child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Amsparity, his/her heart failure status 
must be closely monitored by your child s doctor. If he/she develops new or worsening 
symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of his/her feet), you must contact 
your child s doctor immediately.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale </p>
<ul>
<li>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections 
or help your child to stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, bruises 
or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your child s doctor right away. Your child s doctor 
may decide to stop treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cancer </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking 
adalimumab or other TNF  blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have 
had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and 
leukaemia (cancers that affects blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Amsparity the 
risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, an 
uncommon and severe type of lymphoma has been seen in patients taking adalimumab. Some of 
those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your 
child s doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Amsparity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking 
adalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks 
or areas of damage change appearance, tell your child s doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF<br />
blocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your child s 
doctor whether treatment with a TNF  blocker is appropriate for your child. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Autoimmune disease </p>
<ul>
<li>On rare occasions, treatment with Amsparity could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your 
child s doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness 
occur. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Amsparity </p>
<p>Tell your child s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. </p>
<p>Amsparity can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents 
(for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), 
corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). </p>
<p>Your child should not take Amsparity with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or 
abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other 
TNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk 
for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you 
have questions, please ask your child s doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its 
use for at least 5 months after the last Amsparity treatment. </p>
<p>If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor for 
advice about taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Amsparity should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. </p>
<p>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not 
receive adalimumab. </p>
<p>Amsparity can be used during breast-feeding. </p>
<p>If your child receives Amsparity during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell her baby s doctor and other health care professionals about her 
Amsparity use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on 
vaccines see the  Warnings and precautions  section. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Amsparity may have a small effect on your child s ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room 
spinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Amsparity. </p>
<p>Amsparity contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
