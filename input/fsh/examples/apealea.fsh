<p>This leaflet was last revised in  </p>
<p>Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. </p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Administration precautions 
Paclitaxel is an antineoplastic medicinal product and as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling Apealea. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is 
recommended. If the solution contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed 
thoroughly with water. Apealea should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately 
trained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant and breast-feeding staff should not handle 
Apealea. The reconstituted product should not be diluted. </p>
<p>Reconstitution of the medicinal product 
Apealea is supplied as a sterile powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, the solution 
contains 1 mg/mL of paclitaxel formulated as micellar nanoparticles. The reconstituted solution for 
infusion is a clear, greenish-yellow solution. </p>
<p>Protect from direct and/or bright light throughout the preparation process. The (reconstituted) product 
can only withstand short-term handling in absence of light protection. </p>
<p>Only reconstitute Apealea using one of the following commercially available solutions for 
reconstitution:</p>
<ul>
<li>sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution suitable for infusion; </li>
<li>lactated Ringer s solution suitable for infusion; </li>
<li>acetated Ringer s solution suitable for infusion. </li>
</ul>
<p>The pH of lactated or acetated Ringer s solution must be in the range of 5.0 to 7.5 and acceptable ion 
concentrations of calcium and magnesium are listed below (Table 1). </p>
<p>Table 1. Acceptable ion concentrations for calcium and magnesium in lactated and acetated 
Ringer s solutions suitable for reconstitution 
Ion 
Range (mmol/L) 
Ca2+ 
1.0 3.5<em> 
Mg2+ 
0.0 2.5</em> 
* Solutions containing both Ca2+ and Mg2+ should have a total (combined) concentration of Ca2+ and 
Mg2+ within the range of 1.0 to 3.5 mmol/L. </p>
<p>Apealea should be reconstituted using either one of the three suitable solutions for reconstitution and 
according to the following steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Take the desired number of vials from the refrigerator. The powder should be greenish-yellow 
to yellow. In case of discolouration (orange), discard the vial. To reach room temperature, let 
the vials stand protected from light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes not above 25  C. </li>
<li>Due to negative pressure in the vial, pressure must be equilibrated by a needle before and during 
injection of the solution for reconstitution. Using a sterile syringe, inject 60 mL of solution for 
reconstitution per vial. The solution should be injected during approximately one minute 
towards the inner wall of the vial and not directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. </li>
<li>Swirl the vial in an upright position for approximately for 20 seconds. To keep the generation of 
foam to a minimum, do not shake the vial. </li>
<li>Protect from light and allow the vial to stand for three to five minutes. </li>
<li>Swirl the vial again in upright position for approximately 20 seconds, then gently invert it five 
times. Do not shake. </li>
<li>Continue to swirl the vial until the powder is completely dissolved. Alternatively, the vial may 
be placed on a shaker and rotated for up to 20 minutes, while being protected from light (orbital 
shake pattern; 200 250 rpm). Steps 3 to 6 should not be more than 30 minutes. </li>
<li>The solution should be clear and greenish-yellow without visible particles or precipitates. If 
particles, precipitates, discolouration (orange) or opalescence are observed, the solution should 
be discarded. </li>
<li>Inject the required amount of reconstituted Apealea into an empty, sterile ethylene-vinyl acetate 
(EVA) bag. Ensure that the solution is clear and place a light protective-bag over the EVA 
infusion bag. </li>
</ol>
<p>Shelf life after reconstitution 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2  C to 8  C in lactated 
and acetated Ringer s solution and for 4 hours at 2  C to 8  C in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution when protected from light. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of 
opening and reconstituting precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the 
user. </p>
<p>Intravenous administration<br />
Compatibility with administration sets made of DEHP-free PVC (i.e. polyvinyl chloride without the 
plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) has been demonstrated. However, compatibility with 
DEHP-containing administration sets has not been demonstrated. Administration sets containing a 
15  m polyamide fluid filter should be used. It is important to flush the infusion set and 
catheter/cannula before and after the administration using the solution for reconstitution in order to 
avoid accidental administration into the surrounding tissue and to ensure administration of the 
complete dose. </p>
<p>Disposal<br />
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. </p>         </div>"""
