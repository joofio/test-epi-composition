inhibitors and is used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It blocks 
an enzyme called protease that is involved in the reproduction of HIV. When the enzyme is blocked, 
the virus does not reproduce normally, slowing down the infection. You must take Aptivus together 
with:</p>
<p>low dose ritonavir (this helps Aptivus to reach a high enough level in your blood)</p>
<p>other HIV medicines. Your doctor, together with you, will decide which other medicines you 
should take. This will depend on, for example:</p>
<p>which other medicines you have already taken for HIV</p>
<p>which medicines your HIV is resistant to. If your HIV is resistant to some HIV 
medicines, this means that the medicine will not work so well, or will not work at all.
Aptivus is specifically used for the treatment of HIV which is resistant to most other protease 
inhibitors. Before starting treatment, your doctor will have taken blood samples to test the resistance 
of your HIV. These tests will have confirmed that the HIV in your blood is resistant to most other 
protease inhibitors. Aptivus treatment is therefore appropriate for you. You should not use Aptivus if 
you have never received antiretroviral therapy or have other antiretroviral options available.
Aptivus soft capsules are indicated for:</p>
<p>adolescents 12 years of age or older who have a Body Surface Area (BSA) of  1.3 m2 or weight 
 36 kg</p>

prescribed, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not take Aptivus
-
if you are allergic to tipranavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6)
-
if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will take a blood sample to test how 
well your liver is working (your liver function). Depending on your liver function you may have 
to delay or stop Aptivus treatment
-
if you are currently taking products containing:
-
rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis)
-
cisapride (used to treat stomach problems)
-
pimozide or sertindole (used to treat schizophrenia)
-
quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive 
disorder)
-
lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia)
-
triazolam or oral midazolam (taken by mouth). These medicines are used to treat 
anxiety or sleep disorders
-
ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches)
-
astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergies or hay fever)
-
simvastatin or lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
-
amiodarone, bepridil, flecainide, propafenone or quinidine (used to treat heart 
disorders)
-
metoprolol (used to treat heart failure)
-
alfuzosin and sildenafil (when used to treat a rare blood vessel disorder characterized 
by increased pressure in the pulmonary artery)
-
colchicine (when used to treat gout flares in patients with kidney or liver disease).
Do not take products containing St John s wort (a herbal remedy for depression). This may stop 
Aptivus from working properly.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Aptivus.
Tell your doctor if you have:
-
type A or B haemophilia
-
diabetes
-
liver disease.
If you have:
-
high liver function test results
-
hepatitis B or C infection
you are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver damage while taking Aptivus. Your 
doctor will monitor your liver function by blood tests before and during Aptivus treatment. If you have 
liver disease or hepatitis, your doctor will decide if you need additional testing. You should inform 
your doctor as soon as possible if you notice the signs or symptoms of hepatitis:
-
fever
-
malaise (feeling generally unwell)
-
nausea (upset stomach)
-
vomiting
-
abdominal pain
-
tiredness
-
jaundice (yellowing of the skin or the eyeballs)
Rash:
Mild to moderate rash, including:
-
hives
-
rash with flat or raised small red spots
-
sensitivity to the sun
have been reported in approximately 1 in 10 patients receiving Aptivus. Some patients who developed 
rash also had:
-
joint pain or stiffness
-
throat tightness
-
generalized itching
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection (for example fever, enlarged lymph nodes), please inform your 
doctor immediately.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Tell your doctor if you experience fainting or a sensation of abnormal heart beats. Aptivus in 
combination with low dose ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical 
activity of your heart. These changes may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).
Bone problems: Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease 
called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor.
Children
Aptivus soft capsules should not be used by children under 12 years of age.
Older people
If you are older than 65 years your doctor will exercise caution when prescribing Aptivus soft capsules 
to you and will closely monitor your therapy. Tipranavir has been used in limited number of patients 
65 years or older.
Other medicines and Aptivus
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
This is very important. If you take other medicines at the same time as Aptivus and ritonavir, this can 
strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines. These effects are called interactions, and can lead to 
serious side effects, or prevent proper control of other conditions you may have.
Interactions with other HIV medicines:
-
etravirine belongs to a class of HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTIs). Taking Aptivus with etravirine is not recommended.
-
abacavir and zidovudine. These belong to a class of HIV medicines called nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Your doctor will only prescribe you abacavir and zidovudine if 
you are unable to take other NRTIs. 
-
didanosine: If you are taking didanosine enteric coated tablets, you should take them at least 
two hours before or after Aptivus.
-
emtricitabine: If you are taking emtricitabine your kidney function should be checked before 
initiation of Aptivus.
-
rilpivirine: If you are taking rilpivirine, your doctor will monitor you closely.
-
Protease Inhibitors (PIs): Taking Aptivus may cause large decreases in the blood levels of other 
HIV protease inhibitors. For example the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir 
and saquinavir will be decreased.
Taking Aptivus, with atazanavir, may cause the blood levels of Aptivus and ritonavir to increase 
a lot. 
Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of Aptivus and 
protease inhibitors.
Other medicines with which Aptivus may interact include:
-
oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT): If you are taking the contraceptive pill 
to prevent pregnancy you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. barrier 
contraception like condoms). Generally, it is not recommended to take Aptivus, with ritonavir, 
together with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). You should check 
with your doctor if you do wish to continue taking oral contraceptives or HRT. If you use oral 
contraceptives or HRT you have an increased chance of developing a skin rash while taking 
Aptivus. If a rash occurs, it is usually mild to moderate. You should talk to your doctor as you 
may need to temporarily stop taking either Aptivus or your oral contraceptives or HRT
-
carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). These may decrease the 
effectiveness of Aptivus.
-
sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines used to produce and maintain an erection). The effects 
of sildenafil and vardenafil are likely to be increased if you take them with Aptivus. You should 
not be prescribed tadalafil until you have been taking Aptivus for 7 days or more.
-
omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole (proton pump inhibitors 
used to reduce the gastric acid production)
-
metronidazole (used to treat infections) 
-
disulfiram (used to treat alcohol dependence)
-
buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines used to treat severe pain)
-
cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus (used to prevent organ rejection (to suppress the immune 
system))
-
warfarin (used to treat and prevent thrombosis)
-
digoxin (used to treat heart arrhythmias and heart failure)
-
antifungal medications including fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or voriconazole
The following medicines are not recommended:
-
fluticasone (used to treat asthma)
-
atorvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
-
salmeterol (used to achieve long-term asthma control, bronchospasm prevention with COPD)
-
bosentan (used to treat pulmonary artery hypertension)
-
halofantrine or lumefantrine (used to treat malaria)
-
tolterodine (used to treat overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or 
urge incontinence))
-
cobicistat and products containing cobicistat (used to increase effectiveness of HIV medicines).
Aptivus may lead to a loss of effectiveness of some medicines including:
-
methadone, meperidine (pethidine), used as morphine substitutes
Your doctor may have to increase or decrease the dose of other medicines which you take together 
with Aptivus. Examples include:
-
rifabutin and clarithromycin (antibiotics)
-
theophylline (used to treat asthma) 
-
desipramine, trazodone and bupropion (used to treat depression; bupropion is also used for 
smoking cessation)
-
midazolam (when given by injection); midazolam is a sedative used to treat anxiety and to help 
you sleep
-
rosuvastatin or pravastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
-
colchicine (used to treat gout flares with normal kidney and liver function)
-
raltegravir (used to treat HIV infection)
-
dolutegravir (used to treat HIV infection).
If you take aluminium- and magnesium-based antacid (used to treat dyspepsia/gastrooesophageal 
reflux), the time interval between Aptivus and antacid should be at least two hours.
Tell your doctor if you receive medicines such as blood-thinning agents, or if you are taking vitamin 
E. Your doctor may wish to consider certain precautionary measures in such circumstances.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is not known whether Aptivus may be used safely 
during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. See also Section 2, under  Oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy 
(HRT) .
Aptivus contains very small amounts of alcohol (see Aptivus capsules contain ethanol). 
Driving and using machines
Some of the side effects of Aptivus may affect your ability to drive or operate machinery (e.g. 
dizziness and sleepiness). If affected, you should not drive or operate machinery.
Aptivus capsules contain ethanol, macrogolglycerol ricinoleate and sorbitol (E420)
Aptivus contains 100 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each capsule. The amount in 250 mg of this medicine 
(i.e. one capsule) is equivalent to less than 3 ml of beer, or than 1 ml of wine. The small amount of 
alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. 
Aptivus also contains macrogolglycerol ricinoleate which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.
This medicine contains 12.6 mg of sorbitol in each capsule.</p>         </div>"""

twice per day with food. 
Oral use.
Aptivus capsules should be taken with food, swallowed whole and must not be opened or chewed.
Always take this medicine in combination with other antiretroviral medicines. You should follow the 
instructions for these medicines within the supplied Package Leaflets.
You should continue to take Aptivus for as long as your doctor tells you.
If you take more Aptivus than you should
Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you take more than the prescribed dose of Aptivus.
If you forget to take Aptivus
If you miss a dose of Aptivus or ritonavir by more than 5 hours, wait and then take the next dose of 
Aptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. If you miss a dose of Aptivus and/or ritonavir by 
less than 5 hours, take your missed dose immediately. Then take your next dose of Aptivus and 
ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Aptivus
It has been shown that taking all doses at the appropriate times:
-
greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines
-
reduces the chances of your HIV becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines
Therefore, it is important that you continue taking Aptivus correctly, as described above. Do NOT stop 
taking Aptivus unless your doctor instructs you to do so.

you should see your doctor immediately. 
Muscle disorders 
There have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. These occur particularly when 
Aptivus or other protease inhibitors are taken together with nucleoside analogues. Rarely these muscle 
disorders have been serious, involving breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis).
Additional side effects in children and adolescents
The most common side effects were generally similar to those described in adults. Vomiting, rash and 
fever were observed more frequently in children than in adults.
