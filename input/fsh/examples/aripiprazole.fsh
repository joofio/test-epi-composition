of urine, increase in appetite, and feeling weak) or family history of diabetes 
* fits (seizures) since your doctor may want to monitor you more closely 
* involuntary, irregular muscle movements, especially in the face 
* cardiovascular diseases (diseases of the heart and circulation),, family history of cardiovascular 
disease, stroke or "mini" stroke, abnormal blood pressure 
* blood clots, or family history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been associated with 
formation of blood clots

<p>If you notice you are gaining weight, develop unusual movements, experience somnolence that 
interferes with normal daily activities, any difficulty in swallowing or allergic symptoms, please tell

out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and 
can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high 
sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. 
Your doctor may need to adjust or stop your dose. </p>

are an elderly patient or have some debility. </p>

lower the blood pressure. Be sure to tell your doctor if you take a medicine to keep your blood
