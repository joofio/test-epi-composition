<p>Warnings and precautions 
You must talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Arsenic trioxide medac, if 
* you have impaired kidney function. 
* you have any liver problems. </p>
<p>Your doctor will take the following precautions: 
* Tests will be performed to check the amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium and creatinine 
in your blood before your first dose of Arsenic trioxide medac. 
* You should have an electrical recording of the heart (electrocardiogram, ECG) performed 
before your first dose. 
* Blood tests (potassium, calcium, liver function) should be repeated during your treatment with 
Arsenic trioxide medac. 
* In addition, you will receive electrocardiograms twice weekly. 
* If you are at risk for a certain type of abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. torsade de pointes or QTc 
prolongation), your heart will be monitored continuously. 
* Your doctor may monitor your health during and after treatment, since arsenic trioxide, the 
active substance in Arsenic trioxide medac, may cause other cancers. You should report any 
new and exceptional symptoms and circumstances whenever you see your doctor. 
* Follow-up of your cognitive and mobility functions if you are at risk for vitamin B1 deficiency. </p>

<p>Other medicines and Arsenic trioxide medac 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist 
* if you are taking any of various types of medicines which could cause a change in the rhythm of 
your heartbeat. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>some types of antiarrhythmics (medicines used to correct irregular heart beats, e.g. 
quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) </li>
<li>medicines to treat psychosis (loss of contact with reality, e.g. thioridazine) </li>
<li>medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline) </li>
<li>some types of medicines to treat bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin and 
sparfloxacin) </li>
<li>some medicines to treat allergies such as hayfever, called antihistamines (e.g. 
terfenadine and astemizole) </li>
<li>any medicines that cause a decrease in magnesium or potassium in your blood (e.g. 
amphotericin B) </li>
<li>cisapride (a medicine used to relieve certain stomach problems). 
The effect of these medicines on your heartbeat can be made worse by Arsenic trioxide medac. 
You must be sure to tell your doctor or pharmacist about all medicines you are taking. </li>
<li>if you are taking or have recently taken any medicine which may affect your liver. If you are not 
sure, show the bottle or pack to your doctor or pharmacist. </li>
