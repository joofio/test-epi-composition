ASPAVELI is a medicine that contains the active substance pegcetacoplan. Pegcetacoplan has been 
designed to attach to the C3 complement protein, which is a part of the body s defence system called 
the  complement system . Pegcetacoplan prevents your body s immune system from destroying your 
red blood cells. </p>
<p>What is ASPAVELI used for 
ASPAVELI is used to treat adult patients with a disease called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH) who are still anaemic after treatment with another type of PNH medicine, called a C5 inhibitor, 
for at least 3 months. </p>
<p>In patients with PNH, the  complement system  is overactive and attacks their red blood cells, which 
can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, abdominal pain, dark 
urine, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction, and blood clots. By attaching to 
and blocking the C3 protein, this medicine can stop the complement system from attacking red blood 
cells and so control symptoms of the disease. This medicine has been shown to increase the number of 
red blood cells (reduce anaemia), which may improve these symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to pegcetacoplan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have an infection caused by so-called encapsulated bacteria. 
- if you are not vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 
Haemophilus influenzae. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ASPAVELI. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection 
Before starting ASPAVELI, inform your doctor if you have any infections. </p>
<p>Because the medicine targets the complement system, which is part of the body s defences against 
infection, the use of this medicine increases your risk of infections, including those caused by the 
so-called encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and 
Haemophilus influenzae. These are severe infections affecting your nose, throat and lungs or the 
linings of the brain and can spread throughout the blood and body. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you start ASPAVELI to be sure that you receive vaccination against 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae if you have not had 
these vaccines in the past. If you have had these vaccines in the past, you might still need additional 
vaccinations before starting this medicine. These vaccinations should be given at least 2 weeks before 
beginning therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks beforehand, your doctor will prescribe 
antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection for 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. Following 
vaccination, you may be more closely monitored by your doctor for symptoms of infection. </p>
<p>Infection symptoms 
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>headache and a fever </li>
<li>fever and a rash </li>
<li>fever with or without shivers or chills </li>
<li>shortness of breath </li>
<li>high heart rate </li>
<li>clammy skin </li>
<li>headache with a stiff neck or stiff back </li>
<li>headache with nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting </li>
<li>eyes sensitive to light </li>
<li>muscle aches with flu-like symptoms </li>
<li>confusion </li>
<li>extreme pain or discomfort </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that you keep your vaccinations up to date. You should also be aware that vaccines reduce 
the risk of serious infections, but do not prevent all serious infections. In accordance with national 
recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures such as 
antibacterial medicines to prevent infection. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions may appear in some patients. In case of severe allergic reaction, discontinue 
ASPAVELI infusion and seek medical help immediately. Severe allergic reaction may present as 
difficulty breathing, chest pain or chest tightness, and/or feeling dizzy/faint, severe itching of the skin 
or raised lumps on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue and /or throat, which may cause 
difficulty in swallowing or collapse. </p>
<p>Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions have been observed with the use of ASPAVELI. You should undergo 
appropriate training in proper injection technique before self-administering. </p>
<p>Laboratory monitoring 
During your treatment with ASPAVELI your doctor will perform regular check-ups, including blood 
tests for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and tests of renal function, and may adjust your dose if 
needed. </p>
<p>Effects on laboratory tests 
Use of silica reagents in coagulation tests should be avoided as it can result in artificially prolonged 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 18 years of age as no data are available on its safety and 
effectiveness in this group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ASPAVELI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
Women of childbearing potential 
The effects of the medicine on an unborn child are not known. The use of effective contraception 
methods is recommended during treatment and up to 8 weeks after treatment by women who are able 
to get pregnant. Ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy/breast-feeding 
ASPAVELI is not recommended during pregnancy and breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>ASPAVELI contains sorbitol 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor has told you that you have an intolerance to some sugars 
or if you have been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in 
which a person cannot break down fructose, talk to your doctor before you take or receive this 
medicine. </p>

<p>At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with this medicine, your doctor will review your medical 
records and may give you one or more vaccinations. If you cannot be vaccinated at least 2 weeks 
before you start treatment with ASPAVELI, to reduce the risk of infection, your doctor will prescribe 
antibiotics for 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. </p>
<p>Dose 
The initial recommended dose for adults with PNH is 1 080 mg twice a week in addition to your 
current dose of C5 inhibitor as prescribed for 4 weeks. You should take the twice weekly dose on 
Day 1 and Day 4 of each treatment week. After 4 weeks you should stop taking your C5 inhibitor. </p>
<p>The dose or dosing interval should not be changed without consulting your doctor. Your doctor may 
adjust your dose to 1 080 mg every third day (e.g., Day 1, Day 4, Day 7, Day 10, Day 13, and so forth) 
if appropriate. If you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Method and route of administration 
ASPAVELI is intended to be given as an infusion (drip) under the skin using an infusion pump. Your 
first doses of the medicine will be given to you by healthcare professionals in a clinic or treatment 
centre. If treatment goes well, your doctor may discuss with you the possibility of you giving the 
medicine yourself at home. If this is appropriate, a healthcare professional will train you or a caregiver 
how to give the infusion. </p>
<p>Infusion rate(s) 
The typical infusion time is approximately 30 minutes if you use 2 infusion sites or approximately 
60 minutes if using 1 site. The infusion should be started promptly (and completed within 2 hours after 
preparing the syringe) after drawing this medicinal product into the syringe. </p>
<p>Instructions for use 
Step 1 
Prepare for infusion 
Before you start: 
1. Remove a single vial carton from 
the refrigerator. Keep the vial in the 
carton at room temperature and 
allow it to warm up for 
approximately 30 minutes.

Do not try to speed up the 
warming process using a 
microwave or any other 
heat source. 
2. Find a well-lit, flat work surface 
area, like a table. 
3. Gather your supplies (Figure 1): 
A. 
Syringe system infusion 
pump and 
manufacturer s 
instructions (not shown) 
B. 
Compatible syringe 
C1. Transfer needle OR 
C2. Needleless transfer 
device to draw up 
product from the vial 
D. 
Infusion set (not shown;

<p>Thoroughly clean your work surface using an 
alcohol wipe. 
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and 
water. Dry your hands. 
Step 2 
Check the vial and liquid 
Remove the vial from the carton. Carefully 
look at the liquid in the vial. ASPAVELI is a 
clear, colourless to slightly yellowish liquid. 
Check for particles or colour changes 
(Figure 2). 
Do not use the vial if: 
* The liquid looks cloudy, contains 
particles, or is dark yellow. 
* The protective flip cap is missing or 
damaged. 
* The expiry date (EXP) on the label 
has passed.

with transfer needle attached 
through the centre of the vial 
stopper. 
D. The tip of the transfer needle 
should not be in the solution 
to avoid creating bubbles. 
(Figure 5). 
E. Gently push the air from the 
syringe into the vial. This 
will inject the air from the 
syringe into the vial. 
F. Turn the vial upside down 
(Figure 6). 
G. With the transfer needle tip in 
the solution slowly pull the 
plunger to fill the syringe 
with all the liquid (Figure 7). 
H. Remove the filled syringe 
and the transfer needle from 
the vial.

If you miss a dose, it should be taken as soon as possible; then take the next dose at the regularly 
planned time. </p>
<p>If you stop using ASPAVELI 
PNH is a lifelong condition and so it is expected that you will use this medicine for a long time. If you 
wish to stop using the medicine, please speak to your doctor first. If you stop taking the medicine 
suddenly, you may be at risk of making your symptoms worse. </p>
<p>If your doctor decides to stop your treatment with this medicine, follow their instructions for how to 
stop. Your doctor will monitor you closely for at least 8 weeks after stopping treatment for any signs 
of the destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis) due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen 
due to destruction of red blood cell include:</p>
<ul>
<li>tiredness </li>
<li>shortness of breath </li>
<li>blood in the urine </li>
<li>stomach-area (abdomen) pain </li>
