<p>Atosiban SUN works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) weaker. It also makes the

- If you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. 
- If you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. 
- If your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed 
30 weeks of your pregnancy or more. 
- If your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. 
- If you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered 
straight away. 
- If you have something called  severe pre-eclampsia  and your doctor wants your unborn baby 
to be delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, 
fluid retention and/or protein in your urine. 
- If you have something called  eclampsia  which is similar to  severe pre-eclampsia  but you 
would also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered 
straight away. 
- If your unborn baby has died. 
- If you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). 
- If your placenta is covering the birth canal. 
- If your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. 
- If you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue 
with your pregnancy. </p>
<p>Do not use Atosiban SUN if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN 
- If you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). 
- If you have kidney or liver problems. 
- If you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. 
- If you are pregnant with more than one baby. 
- If your contractions start again, treatment with Atosiban SUN can be repeated up to three more 
times. 
- If your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. 
- Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause 
bleeding. 
- If you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth 
of your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung 
oedema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs). </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist 
before you are given Atosiban SUN. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Atosiban SUN has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Atosiban SUN 
Tell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are 
given Atosiban SUN. </p>         </div>"""
