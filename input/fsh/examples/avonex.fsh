  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What AVONEX is
The active substance in Avonex is a protein called interferon beta-1a. Interferons are natural 
substances made in your body to help protect you from infections and diseases. The protein in Avonex 
is made up of exactly the same ingredients as interferon beta that is found in the human body. 
What AVONEX is used for
Avonex is used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Treatment with Avonex can help to prevent you 
from getting worse, although it will not cure MS.
Everyone has their own set of MS symptoms. These can include:
-
Feeling off-balance or light headed, walking problems, stiffness and muscle spasms, tiredness, 
numbness in the face, arms or legs
-
Acute or chronic pain, bladder and bowel problems, sexual problems and problems seeing 
things
-
Difficulty in thinking and concentrating, depression.
MS also tends to flare up from time to time: this is called a relapse.
(Notes information)
Avonex works best when you use it:
-
at the same time 
-
once a week 
-
on a regular basis
Do not stop your Avonex treatment without speaking to your doctor.
Avonex can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling 
effects of MS. Your doctor will advise you for how long you can use Avonex or when to stop.
How AVONEX works
Multiple sclerosis is linked to nerve (brain or spinal cord) damage. In MS, your body s defence system 
reacts against its own myelin   the  insulation  that surrounds nerve fibres. When myelin is damaged, 
the messages between the brain and other parts of the body are disrupted. This is what causes the 
symptoms of MS. Avonex seems to work by stopping your body s defence system from attacking the 
myelin.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
-
If you have severe depression or think about committing suicide.
Talk to a doctor straight away if any of these apply to you.
(Notes information)
Avonex and allergic reactions. Because Avonex is based on a protein, there is a small chance of an 
allergic reaction.
More about depression. If you have severe depression or thoughts about suicide, you must not use 
Avonex.
If you have depression, your doctor may still prescribe Avonex for you, but it's important to let your 
doctor know if you have had depression or any similar problems affecting your moods.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Avonex if you have or have had in the past:
-
Depression or problems affecting your moods
-
Thoughts about committing suicide.
Changes to your mood, thoughts about suicide, feeling unusually sad, anxious or worthless, should be 
reported to your doctor immediately.
-
Epilepsy or other seizure disorders not controlled by medication
-
Serious kidney or liver problems
-
A low number of white blood cells or platelets, which can cause an increased risk of 
infection, bleeding or anaemia
-
Heart problems, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain (angina), particularly after any 
activity; swollen ankles, shortness of breath (congestive heart failure); or an irregular heartbeat 
(arrhythmias).
-
Irritation at an injection site, which can lead to skin and tissue damage (injection site necrosis). 
When you are ready to inject, carefully follow the instructions in section 7  How to inject 
AVONEX , at the end of this leaflet. This is to reduce the risk of injection site reactions.
Talk to your doctor if you have any of these conditions, or if they worsen whilst taking Avonex.
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could affect 
your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Avonex. 
Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidneys.
Tell your doctor you are using Avonex:
-
If you are having a blood test. Avonex may interfere with the results.
(Notes information)
Sometimes you will need to remind other medical staff that you are being treated with Avonex. 
For example, if you are prescribed other medicines, or if you have a blood test, Avonex may affect the 
other medicines or the test result.
Paediatric population
Avonex is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because there is limited data on the 
use of Avonex in this population. Avonex should not be used in children below 10 years of age 
because it is yet to be established whether it would work for them and whether it would be safe.
Other medicines and AVONEX
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, especially 
those used to treat epilepsy or depression. Avonex may affect other medicines or be affected by them. 
This includes any other medicines including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Avonex can be used during breast-
feeding.
Driving and using machines
If you feel dizzy, do not drive. Avonex makes some people feel dizzy. If this happens to you, or if 
you get any other side effects that could affect your ability, do not drive or use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of AVONEX
This medicine is essentially  sodium-free . It contains less than 23 mg (1 mmol) sodium in each 
weekly dose.</p>         </div>"""

One injection of Avonex, once a week.
Try to use Avonex at the same time on the same day each week.
If you have decided to start treatment with Avonex, your doctor may provide you with an Avostartclip 
titration kit. The Avostartclip attaches to the syringe and enables you to gradually increase your dose 
of Avonex when you first start treatment. This is to limit flu-like symptoms which some people 
experience when they start using Avonex. Your doctor or nurse will help you use the Avostartclip 
titration kit. 
(Notes information)
Starting Avonex
If you are new to Avonex, your doctor may advise you to gradually increase your dose so that you 
can adjust to the effects of Avonex before taking the full dose. You will be provided with an 
Avostartclip titration kit. Avostartclips can be attached onto the syringe enabling a reduced dose of 
Avonex to be injected at the start of treatment. Each Avostartclip should be used once and then 
discarded along with any remaining Avonex. For further details on use, speak with your doctor. <br />
Injecting yourself
You can inject Avonex yourself without the help of your doctor, if they have trained you to do this. 
The instructions on how to inject yourself are at the end of this leaflet (see section 7, How to inject 
AVONEX).
If you have trouble handling the syringe, ask your doctor who may be able to help.
(Notes information)
There are more details on how to inject Avonex at the end of this leaflet.
Alternate needle:
Your pack of Avonex already includes a needle for injection. It may be possible for your doctor to 
prescribe you a shorter and thinner needle, depending on your body type. Talk to your doctor to see if 
this is appropriate for you.
If you have problems handling the syringe, talk to your doctor about using a syringe grip. This is a 
specially designed holder to help you with injecting Avonex.
How long to use AVONEX
Your doctor will tell you how long you need to keep using Avonex. It is important to continue using 
Avonex regularly. Do not make changes unless your doctor tells you.
If you inject more than you should
You should only have one injection of Avonex, once a week. If you have used more than one injection 
of Avonex in a three-day period, contact your doctor or pharmacist straight away for advice.
If you miss an injection
If you miss your usual weekly dose, inject a dose as soon as you can. Then leave a week before using 
Avonex again. Continue injecting on this new day every week. If you have a preferred day for using 
Avonex, talk to your doctor about managing the dose, to get back to your preferred day. Do not use 
two injections to make up for a missed injection.</p>         </div>"""

Effects of the injection
-
Feeling faint: Your first injection of Avonex may be given by your doctor. It may make you 
feel faint. You may even actually faint. This is unlikely to happen again.
-
Just after an injection, your muscles may feel tense or very weak   as though you are having 
a relapse. This is rare. It only happens when you inject and the effects soon pass. They may 
happen any time after starting on Avonex.
-
If you notice any irritation or skin problems after an injection, talk to your doctor.
Flu-like symptoms
(Notes information)
Three simple ways to help reduce the impact of flu-like symptoms:
1. Use your Avonex injection just before bedtime. This may allow you to sleep through the 
effects.
2. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen half an hour before your Avonex injection and continue 
taking it for up to a day. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about a suitable dose.
3. If you have a fever, drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated.
Some people find that after injecting Avonex, they feel like they have flu. Signs are:
-
Headache
-
Muscle aches
-
Chills or a fever.
These symptoms are not really flu
You can t pass it on to anyone else. They are more common when you first start using Avonex. Your 
doctor may provide you with an Avostartclip titration kit which enables you to gradually increase your 
dose at the start of treatment to help limit flu-like symptoms. As you keep using your injections, the 
flu-like symptoms gradually decrease.
Children (10 years of age and above) and adolescents
In clinical trials, some side effects were reported more frequently in children and adolescents than in 
adults, e.g., muscle pain, pain in extremity, fatigue, and joint pain.

not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
