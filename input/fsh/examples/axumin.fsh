<p>Axumin contains the active substance fluciclovine (18F) and is given so that doctors can perform a 
special type of scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. If you have previously had 
treatment for prostate cancer and information from other tests (e.g. prostate specific antigen, PSA) 
indicates that the cancer may have returned, an Axumin PET scan can help your doctor find the 
locations where the cancer has come back.  </p>
<p>You should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. </p>
<p>The use of Axumin does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the benefit of this procedure with the 
radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to radiation.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Axumin if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have kidney problems </li>
<li>are on a low sodium diet (see section "Axumin contains sodium"). </li>
</ul>
<p>Before administration of Axumin you:</p>
<ul>
<li>should avoid exercise for at least a day before the Axumin scan. </li>
<li>should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan (you can take your usual medicines 
with small amounts of water).   </li>
<li>may urinate at the latest 60 minutes before the Axumin injection and you should avoid urination 
until after the scan has been completed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor if you are under 18 years old. Axumin is not intended for use in 
children and adolescents aged under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Axumin<br />
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine is not indicated for use in women. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
It is considered unlikely that Axumin will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>
<p>Axumin contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 39 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This 
is equivalent to 2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  </p>         </div>"""

Axumin will only be used in specially controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given 
to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for 
the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.  </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Axumin to be 
used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. The 
quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult is 370 MBq (megabecquerel, the unit 
used to express radioactivity). </p>
<p>Administration of Axumin and conduct of the procedure<br />
Axumin is administered intravenously as an injection into your vein followed by a flush of sodium 
chloride solution to ensure that you receive the full dose.  </p>
<p>One injection is usually sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure<br />
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. The scan will 
usually start approximately 5 minutes after the Axumin injection is given. </p>
<p>After administration of Axumin you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for the 12 hours following 
the injection </li>
<li>urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.  </p>
<p>If you have been given more Axumin than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose of Axumin precisely controlled by 
the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, you will 
receive the appropriate treatment. In particular, the nuclear medicine doctor in charge of the procedure 
may provide ways to increase the passing of urine and stools in order to facilitate the removal of 
radioactivity from your body. </p>
<p>Should you have any further question on the use of Axumin, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""
