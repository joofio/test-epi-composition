  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Aybintio contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a 
type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection 
and cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF 
protein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with 
nutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking 
the growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. </p>
<p>Aybintio is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, 
i.e., in the colon or rectum. Aybintio will be administered in combination with chemotherapy 
treatment containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine. </p>
<p>Aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for 
patients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called 
paclitaxel or capecitabine. </p>
<p>Aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
Aybintio will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. </p>
<p>Aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
when cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
Aybintio will be administered in combination with erlotinib. </p>
<p>Aybintio is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for 
patients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. </p>
<p>Aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Aybintio will be administered in 
combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. </p>
<p>When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Aybintio will be administered in 
combination with paclitaxel, or topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. </p>
<p>Aybintio is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer. Aybintio will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, 
paclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy. </p>         </div>"""

- you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell products or to other 
recombinant human or humanised antibodies. 
- you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Aybintio: </p>
<p>It is possible that Aybintio may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you 
have conditions causing inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, 
colitis associated with chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor. </p>
<p>Aybintio may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway 
between two organs or vessels. The risk of developing connections between the vagina and 
any parts of the gut can increase if you have persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer. </p>
<p>This medicine can increase the risk of bleeding or increase the risk of problems with wound 
healing after surgery. If you are going to have an operation, if you have had major surgery 
within the last 28 days or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery, you should 
not receive this medicine. </p>
<p>Aybintio may increase the risk of developing serious infections of the skin or deeper layers 
under the skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing. </p>
<p>Aybintio can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. If you have high blood 
pressure which is not well controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your 
doctor as it is important to make sure that your blood pressure is under control before 
starting Aybintio treatment. </p>
<p>If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) 
or a tear in a blood vessel wall. </p>
<p>This medicine increases the risk of having protein in your urine especially if you already 
have high blood pressure. </p>
<p>The risk of developing blood clots in your arteries (a type of blood vessel) can increase if 
you are over 65 years old, if you have diabetes, or if you have had previous blood clots in 
your arteries. Please talk to your doctor since blood clots can lead to heart attack and stroke. </p>
<p>Aybintio can also increase the risk of developing blood clots in your veins (a type of blood 
vessel). </p>
<p>This medicine may cause bleeding, especially tumour-related bleeding. Please consult your 
doctor if you or your family tend to suffer from bleeding problems or you are taking 
medicines to thin the blood for any reason. </p>
<p>It is possible that Aybintio may cause bleeding in and around your brain. Please discuss this 
with your doctor if you have metastatic cancer affecting your brain. </p>
<p>It is possible that Aybintio can increase the risk of bleeding in your lungs, including 
coughing or spitting blood. Please discuss with your doctor if you noticed this previously. </p>
<p>Aybintio can increase the risk of developing a weak heart. It is important that your doctor 
knows if you have ever received anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin, a specific type of 
chemotherapy used to treat some cancers) or had radiotherapy to your chest, or if you have 
heart disease. </p>
<p>This medicine may cause infections and a decreased number of your neutrophils (a type 
of blood cell important for your protection against bacteria). </p>
<p>It is possible that Aybintio can cause hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic shock) and/or 
infusion reactions (reactions related to your injection of the medicine). Please let your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse know if you have previously experienced problems after injections, such 
as dizziness/feeling of fainting, breathlessness, swelling or skin rash. </p>
<p>A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
has been associated with Aybintio treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, 
confusion or seizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Please consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past.  </p>
<p>Before you are given Aybintio or while you are being treated with Aybintio: </p>
<p>if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the 
mouth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your 
doctor and dentist immediately. </p>
<p>if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that 
you are being treated with Aybintio, in particular when you are also receiving or have 
received an injection of bisphosphonate into your blood. </p>
<p>You may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with Aybintio. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Aybintio use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the 
safety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations. </p>
<p>Death of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw have been reported in patients under 
18 years old when treated with Aybintio.
Other medicines and Aybintio 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Combinations of Aybintio with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and 
gastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you 
do not combine these medicine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast 
cancer. These therapies in combination with Aybintio may increase the risk of severe side effects. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. Aybintio may cause damage to your unborn baby 
as it may stop the formation of new blood vessels. Your doctor should advise you about using 
contraception during treatment with Aybintio and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Aybintio. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straightaway if you are pregnant, become pregnant during treatment with this 
medicine, or plan to become pregnant in the near future. </p>
<p>You must not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Aybintio and for at least 6 months after the 
last dose of Aybintio, as this medicine may interfere with the growth and development of your baby. </p>
<p>Aybintio may impair female fertility. Please consult your doctor for more information. Ask your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Aybintio has not been shown to reduce your ability to drive or to use any tools or machines. However, 
sleepiness and fainting have been reported with Aybintio use. If you experience symptoms that affect 
your vision or concentration, or your ability to react, do not drive and use machines until symptoms 
disappear. </p>

prescribed for you, some or all of the contents of the Aybintio vial will be diluted with sodium 
chloride solution before use. A doctor or nurse will give you this diluted Aybintio solution by 
intravenous infusion (a drip into your vein). The first infusion will be given to you over 90 minutes. If 
this is well-tolerated the second infusion may be given over 60 minutes. Later infusions may be given 
to you over 30 minutes. </p>
<p>The administration of Aybintio should be temporarily discontinued </p>
<p>if you develop severe high blood pressure requiring treatment with blood pressure medicines, </p>
<p>if you have problems with wound healing following surgery, </p>
<p>if you undergo surgery. </p>

<p>you may develop a severe migraine. If this happens you should talk to your doctor, pharmacist 
or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>If a dose of Aybintio is missed </p>
<p>your doctor will decide when you should be given your next dose of Aybintio. You should 
discuss this with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop treatment with Aybintio 
Stopping your treatment with Aybintio may stop the effect on tumour growth. Do not stop treatment 
with Aybintio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. </p>
