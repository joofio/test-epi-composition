<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Baraclude 
* if you have ever had problems with your kidneys, tell your doctor. This is important because 
Baraclude is eliminated from your body through the kidneys and your dose or dosing schedule 
may need to be adjusted. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>do not stop taking Baraclude without your doctor s advice since your hepatitis may worsen 
after stopping treatment. When your treatment with Baraclude is stopped, your doctor will 
continue to monitor you and take blood tests for several months. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discuss with your doctor whether your liver functions properly and, if not, what the possible 
effects on your Baraclude treatment may be. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are also infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) be sure to tell your doctor. 
You should not take Baraclude to treat your hepatitis B infection unless you are taking 
medicines for HIV at the same time, as the effectiveness of future HIV treatment may be 
reduced. Baraclude will not control your HIV infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taking Baraclude will not stop you from infecting other people with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) through sexual contact or body fluids (including blood contamination). So, it is 
important to take appropriate precautions to prevent others from becoming infected with HBV. 
A vaccine is available to protect those at risk from becoming infected with HBV. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baraclude belongs to a class of medicines that can cause lactic acidosis (excess of lactic acid 
in your blood) and enlargement of the liver. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and stomach 
pain might indicate the development of lactic acidosis. This rare but serious side effect has 
occasionally been fatal. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are 
very overweight. Your doctor will monitor you regularly while you are receiving Baraclude. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have previously received treatment for chronic hepatitis B, please inform your doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Baraclude should not be used for children below 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Baraclude 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Baraclude with food and drink 
In most cases you may take Baraclude with or without food. However, if you have had a previous 
treatment with a medicine containing the active substance lamivudine you should consider the 
following. If you were switched over to Baraclude because the treatment with lamivudine was not 
successful, you should take Baraclude on an empty stomach once daily. If your liver disease is very 
advanced, your doctor will also instruct you to take Baraclude on an empty stomach. Empty stomach 
means at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next meal. 
Children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age) can take Baraclude with or without 
food. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It has not been demonstrated that 
Baraclude is safe to use during pregnancy. Baraclude must not be used during pregnancy unless 
specifically directed by your doctor. It is important that women of childbearing age receiving 
treatment with Baraclude use an effective method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant. </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed during treatment with Baraclude. Tell your doctor if you are breast-
feeding. It is not known whether entecavir, the active ingredient in Baraclude, is excreted in human 
breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness, tiredness (fatigue) and sleepiness (somnolence) are common side effects which may impair 
your ability to drive and use machines. If you have any concerns consult your doctor. </p>
<p>Baraclude contains lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>For adults the recommended dose is either 0.5 mg or 1 mg once daily orally (by mouth). </p>
<p>Your dose will depend on: 
* whether you have been treated for HBV infection before, and what medicine you received. 
* whether you have kidney problems. Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose for you or instruct 
you to take it less often than once a day. 
* the condition of your liver. </p>
<p>For children and adolescents (from 2 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the 
right dose based on your child's weight. The Baraclude oral solution is recommended for patients 
weighing from 10 kg to 32.5 kg.Children weighing at least 32.6 kg may take the oral solution or the 
0.5 mg tablet. All dosing will be taken once daily orally (by mouth). There are no recommendations 
for Baraclude in children less than 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg. </p>
<p>Your doctor will advise you on the dose that is right for you. Always take the dose recommended by 
your doctor to ensure that your medicine is fully effective and to reduce the development of resistance 
to treatment. Take Baraclude as long as your doctor has told you. Your doctor will tell you if and when 
you should stop the treatment. </p>
<p>Some patients must take Baraclude on an empty stomach (see Baraclude with food and drink in 
Section 2). If your doctor instructs you to take Baraclude on an empty stomach, empty stomach means 
at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 2 hours before your next meal. </p>
<p>If you take more Baraclude than you should 
Contact your doctor at once. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Baraclude 
It is important that you do not miss any doses. If you miss a dose of Baraclude, take it as soon as 
possible, and then take your next scheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next 
dose, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>Do not stop Baraclude without your doctor s advice 
Some people get very serious hepatitis symptoms when they stop taking Baraclude. Tell your doctor 
immediately about any changes in symptoms that you notice after stopping treatment. </p>
