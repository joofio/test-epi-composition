This medicine contains the active substance follitropin alfa, which is almost identical to a natural 
hormone produced by your body called  follicle-stimulating hormone  (FSH). FSH is a gonadotropin, 
a type of hormone that plays an important role in human fertility and reproduction. In women, FSH is 
needed for the growth and development of the sacs (follicles) in the ovaries that contain the egg cells. 
In men, FSH is needed for the production of sperm. </p>
<p>What Bemfola is used for </p>
<p>In adult women, Bemfola is used: 
* to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called  clomiphene citrate . 
* together with another medicine called  lutropin alfa  ( luteinising hormone  or LH) to help 
release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
* to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
 in vitro fertilisation ,  gamete intra-fallopian transfer  or  zygote intra-fallopian transfer . </p>
<p>In adult men, Bemfola is used: 
* together with another medicine called  human chorionic gonadotropin  (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Do not use Bemfola 
* if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
* if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
* if you are a woman:</p>
<ul>
<li>with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. </li>
<li>with unexplained vaginal bleeding. </li>
<li>with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. </li>
<li>with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. </li>
<li>
<p>if you are a man:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use Bemfola if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Bemfola. </p>
<p>Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
* your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
* you have stomach, arm or leg pain. </p>
<p>In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. Bemfola treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy 
When using Bemfola, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time ( multiple pregnancy , mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Bemfola at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. </p>
<p>Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. </p>
<p>Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with Bemfola treatment. </p>
<p>Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. Bemfola 
usually does not work if you have this problem. If your doctor decides to try Bemfola treatment, to 
monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting 
treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Bemfola is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Bemfola 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
* If you use Bemfola with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
* If you use Bemfola at the same time as a  gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (GnRH) agonist or 
antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of Bemfola to produce follicles. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Bemfola if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Bemfola contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

you are not sure. </p>
<p>Using this medicine 
* Bemfola is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). Use each pre-
filled pen only once then they should be disposed of in a safe manner. Do not administered the 
solution if it contains particles or is not clear. 
* The first injection of Bemfola should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
* Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Bemfola pre-filled pen to inject the medicine 
yourself. 
* If you administer Bemfola to yourself, please carefully read and follow the  Instructions for 
Use . These instructions can be found at the end of the package leaflet. </p>
<p>How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU) and millilitres (mL). </p>
<p>Women </p>
<p>If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods 
* Bemfola is usually given every day. 
* If you have irregular periods, start using Bemfola within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
* The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 75 to 150 IU (0.12 to 0.25 mL) each day. 
* Your dose of Bemfola may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get 
the desired response. 
* The maximum daily dose of Bemfola is usually not higher than 225 IU (0.375 mL). 
* When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
 recombinant hCG  (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last Bemfola injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. </p>
<p>If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with Bemfola should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
Bemfola than before. </p>
<p>If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2,  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of Bemfola than before. </p>
<p>If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
* The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 75 to 150 IU (0.12 to 0.25 mL) together with 75 IU 
(0.12 mL) of lutropin alfa. 
* You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
* Your dose of Bemfola may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get 
the desired response. 
* When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
 recombinant hCG  (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of Bemfola and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor s judgment. </p>
<p>If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with Bemfola should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of Bemfola than 
before. </p>
<p>If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with Bemfola will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2,  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of Bemfola than before. </p>
<p>If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
* The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 150 to 225 IU (0.25 to 0.37 mL) each day, from day 2 or 3 
of your treatment cycle. 
* Bemfola dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU (0.75 mL). 
* Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
* When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms  recombinant 
hCG  (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last Bemfola injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. </p>
<p>In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then Bemfola is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The Bemfola and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU Bemfola is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.<br />
Men 
* The usual dose of Bemfola is 150 IU (0.25 mL) together with hCG. 
* You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
* If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. </p>
<p>If you use more Bemfola than you should 
The effects of taking too much Bemfola are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2,  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). </p>
<p>If you forget to use Bemfola 
If you forget to use Bemfola, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to 
your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Serious side effects in women 
* Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also section 2  Ovarian hyper-stimulation 
syndrome (OHSS) ). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
* The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
* Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
* Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also section 2,  Blood clotting 
problems(thromboembolic events) ). </p>
<p>Serious side effects in men and women 
* Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing 
can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). </p>
<p>If you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor, who 
might ask you to stop using Bemfola. </p>
