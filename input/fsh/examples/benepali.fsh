<p>Benepali is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein 
in the body that causes inflammation. Benepali works by reducing the inflammation associated with 
certain diseases. </p>
<p>In adults (aged 18 and over), Benepali can be used for:<br />
<em> moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis;<br />
</em> psoriatic arthritis;<br />
* severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis; 
* moderate or severe plaque psoriasis. 
In each case Benepali is used, usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well 
enough or are not suitable for you. </p>
<p>For rheumatoid arthritis, Benepali is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may 
also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in 
combination with methotrexate, Benepali can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the 
rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. </p>
<p>For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, Benepali can improve your ability to 
do normal daily activities.  </p>
<p>For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), 
Benepali can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease.  </p>
<p>Benepali is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents. 
* For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not 
worked well enough or is not suitable for them: </p>
<p>Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients 
from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more 
when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severe plaque psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who 
have had an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic 
therapies. </p>

* if you or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as 
chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your 
doctor immediately.<br />
* if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If 
you are not sure, please contact your doctor. 
* if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Benepali. </p>
<ul>
<li>Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, 
wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Benepali, and contact your doctor immediately. </li>
<li>Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major 
surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with Benepali. </li>
<li>Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or 
suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. </li>
<li>Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If 
you or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your 
doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the 
presence of infections after you stop using Benepali. </li>
<li>Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Benepali, 
your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Benepali. This 
may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of 
these tests should be recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor 
if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, 
listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor 
immediately. </li>
<li>Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor 
should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with 
Benepali. Treatment with Benepali may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have 
previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using 
Benepali. </li>
<li>Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to 
monitor the treatment with Benepali in case the infection worsens. </li>
<li>Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or 
symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms 
may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require 
discontinuation of Benepali. </li>
<li>Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, 
optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of 
the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if Benepali is an appropriate treatment. </li>
<li>Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart 
failure, because Benepali needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. </li>
<li>Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or 
any other cancer before you are given Benepali. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who 
have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing 
lymphoma. Children and adults taking Benepali may have an increased risk of developing 
lymphoma or another cancer. Some children and teenage patients who have received etanercept 
or other medicines that work the same way as etanercept have developed cancers, including 
unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. Some patients receiving Benepali have 
developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child develop any change in the 
appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. </li>
<li>Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using 
Benepali. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. </li>
<li>Alcohol abuse: Benepali should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol 
abuse. Please tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse.  </li>
<li>Wegener s granulomatosis: Benepali is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener s 
granulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener s 
granulomatosis, talk to your doctor. </li>
<li>Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking 
medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic 
medicine while taking Benepali. </li>
<li>Vaccinations: Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given during Benepali 
therapy. Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Benepali is not indicated for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg. </p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
Benepali. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using Benepali. 
Please consult your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Benepali should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below 
the age of 2 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or 
psoriatic arthritis below the age of 12 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with psoriasis 
below the age of 6 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Benepali 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine).  </p>
<p>You or the child should not use Benepali with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or 
abatacept. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use appropriate contraception to avoid 
becoming pregnant during Benepali therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. </p>
<p>Benepali should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.  </p>
<p>If you received Benepali during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. 
In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, 
compared with mothers who had not received etanercept or other similar medicines (TNF-
antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no 
increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will 
help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. Talk to 
your doctor if you want to breastfeed while on Benepali treatment. It is important that you tell your 
baby s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Benepali during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding before your baby receives any vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
No information is available if the use of Benepali effects the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
