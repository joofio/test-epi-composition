<p>Beromun is used, together with melphalan containing medicine, for the treatment of soft tissue 
sarcoma of the arms and legs. By reducing the size of the tumour, the treatment is intended to facilitate

thus to delay or prevent the need for arm or leg amputation.  </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to tasonermin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have significant heart problems 
- if you have severe lung disease 
- if you have or have recently had a stomach ulcer 
- if you have too low numbers of blood cells or bleeding problems 
- if you have moderate to severe liver or kidney disease

prevent blood clotting) or radioactive tracers 
- if you are also using medicines with heart toxicity<br />
- if you have raised levels of calcium in your blood 
- if you have certain infections which do not respond to antibiotics 
- if you have severe swelling of the affected arm or leg due to local fluid build-up, or severe fluid 
build-up in the abdomen 
- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. 
- if you are breast-feeding, you must stop for at least seven days after receiving Beromun </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Beromun will be administered by a doctor who is experienced and skilled in isolated limb perfusion 
(ILP). This technique ensures that Beromun is kept within the affected arm or leg. It is important that 
it does not reach other parts of your body, because this so-called systemic leakage could cause serious 
side effects on the main organs of the body.  </p>
<p>During the IPL and the seven to ten day period afterwards you will need to stay in hospital, your 
doctor will carefully monitor your blood pressure, circulation and any side effects. You may have to 
stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) directly after the ILP for a short time. </p>
<p>A condition called  compartment syndrome  may develop within the first three days after Beromun 
administration. Symptoms of muscle damage at the perfused limb include pain, swelling, as well as 
neurological symptoms (e. g. paraesthesia, paralysis), all of which should be reported immediately to 
the attending doctor. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Beromun 
Tell your doctor if you are using,  have recently used or might use any other medicines. In particular, 
you should tell your doctor if you are using medicines to lower blood pressure (to treat hypertension). </p>
<p>For ILP, you will also receive other medicines to control pain, fever, blood pressure and blood 
clotting, as well as general anaesthesia. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must not use Beromun if you are pregnant. 
You must not breast-feed for at least seven days after treatment with Beromun. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Not relevant </p>
<p>Beromun contains sodium 
This medicine contains 151.27 mg (6.58mmol) sodium in each recommended dose. This is equivalent 
to 7.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Beromun will be administered by isolated limb perfusion (ILP), together with the anti-tumour agent 
melphalan. This will occur whilst you are unconscious, under the influence of a general anaesthetic. </p>
<p>The blood flow to and from your affected limb will be stopped using a tourniquet. Blood, supplied 
with oxygen by a heart and lung machine, is pumped into your affected limb via a catheter in the main 
artery, while it is drained (pumped out) from the main vein. Beromun and then melphalan are injected 
into this circuit, over a total of 90 minutes the affected limb will be exposed to Beromun. </p>
<p>The recommended dose of Beromun depends on the affected limb, usually 3 mg for the arm and 4 mg 
for the leg. Beromun powder has to be dissolved before use. The resulting solution will be 
administered into an artery in your affected arm or leg by ILP for an initial period of 30 minutes.<br />
After that, melphalan will be added and the ILP continued for another 60 minutes.<br />
Finally, your limb will be washed out to remove the rest of Beromun and melphalan. </p>
<p>ILP allows that tumour cells in your limb can be exposed to a very high dose of Beromun and 
melphalan, enhancing their anti-tumour effect, but without reaching the rest of the body, where they 
could cause serious side effects.  </p>
<p>You will usually not receive a second ILP with Beromun. If you do, this will not be until at least six 
weeks after your first ILP. </p>
<p>If you use more Beromun than you should 
As Beromun is always administered by experienced and qualified hospital doctors, accidental 
overdose is extremely unlikely. However, should this occur, your doctor will immediately wash out 
your affected limb to remove Beromun, and the ILP will be stopped. If there is any risk of serious side 
effects, your doctor will immediately transfer you to an intensive care unit to closely monitor you and 
start adequate treatment. </p>
<p>If there is significant systemic leakage of Beromun 
If more than 10% of your Beromun dose reaches the main part of your body, your doctor will take 
similar measures as in the case of overdose.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

factors. Some of the side effects can be serious, particularly if Beromun reaches other parts of your 
body (systemic leakage). In approximately 2% of cases, Beromun may cause tissue damage in your 
affected arm or leg which is severe enough to require amputation. If there is any risk of serious side 
effects, your doctor will immediately transfer you to an intensive care unit to closely monitor you and 
start adequate treatment. </p>
