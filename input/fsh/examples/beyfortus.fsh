Beyfortus is a medicine given as an injection to protect babies against respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV). RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms comparable to the 
common cold. However, especially in babies and older adults, RSV can cause severe illness, including 
bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) 
that may lead to hospitalisation or even death. The virus is usually more common during the winter.
Beyfortus contains the active ingredient nirsevimab which is an antibody (a protein designed to attach 
to a specific target) that attaches to a protein that RSV needs to infect the body. By attaching to this 
protein, Beyfortus blocks its action, thereby stopping the virus from entering and infecting human 
cells.
What Beyfortus is used for
Beyfortus is a medicine to protect your child from getting RSV disease.</p> </div>"""

Inform your child s doctor, pharmacist or nurse if this applies to your child. If you are not sure, check 
with your child s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before the medicine is given.
If your child shows signs of a severe allergic reaction contact the doctor immediately.
Warnings and precautions 
Tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs of an allergic reaction, 
such as:</p>
<p>difficulty breathing or swallowing</p>
<p>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat</p>
<p>severe itching of the skin, with a red rash or raised bumps
Talk to your healthcare provider before your child is given Beyfortus if they have low numbers of 
blood platelets (which help blood clotting), a bleeding problem or bruise easily or if they are taking an 
anticoagulant (a medicine to prevent blood clots).
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children between the age of 2 and 18 years of age because it has not been 
studied in this group. 
Other medicines and Beyfortus
Beyfortus is not known to interact with other medicines. However, tell your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines.

winter (known as the RSV season). If your child is born during the winter, Beyfortus should be given 
after birth.
If your child is to have a heart operation (cardiac surgery), he or she may be given an extra dose of 
Beyfortus after the operation to ensure they have adequate protection over the remainder of the RSV 
season.
