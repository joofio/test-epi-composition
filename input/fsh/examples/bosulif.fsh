if your doctor has told you that your liver has been damaged and is not working normally.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Bosulif:
-
if you have, or have had in the past, liver problems. Tell your doctor if you have a history of 
liver problems including hepatitis (liver infection or inflammation) of any kind, or a history of 
any of the following signs and symptoms of liver problems: itching, yellow eyes or skin, dark 
urine, and pain or discomfort in the right upper stomach area. Your doctor should do blood tests 
to check your liver function prior to your starting treatment with Bosulif and for the first 
3 months of treatment with Bosulif, and as clinically indicated.
-
if you have diarrhoea and vomiting. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs 
and symptoms: an increase in the number of stools (bowel movements) per day over normal, an 
increase in episodes of vomiting, blood in your vomit, stools (bowel movements) or urine, or 
have black stools (tarry black bowel movements). You should ask your doctor if use of your 
treatment for vomiting may result in a greater risk of heart arrhythmias. In particular, you should 
ask your doctor if you want to use a medicine containing domperidone for the treatment of 
nausea and/or vomiting. Treatment of nausea or vomiting with such medicines together with 
Bosulif may result in a greater risk of dangerous heart arrhythmias.
-
if you suffer from bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following 
signs and symptoms such as abnormal bleeding or bruising without having an injury.
-
if you have an infection. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs and 
symptoms such as fever, problems with urine such as burning on urination, a new cough, or a 
new sore throat.
-
if you have fluid retention. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following signs and 
symptoms of fluid retention during Bosulif treatment such as swelling of the ankles, feet or legs; 
difficulty breathing chest pain or a cough (these may be signs of fluid retention in the lungs or 
chest).
-
if you have heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a heart disorder, such as arrhythmias 
or an abnormal electrical signal called  prolongation of the QT interval . This is always 
important, but especially if you are experiencing frequent or prolonged diarrhoea as described 
above. If you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heartbeat while taking Bosulif,
tell your doctor immediately, as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition.
-
if you have been told that you have problems with your kidneys. Tell your doctor if you are 
urinating more frequently and producing larger amounts of urine with a pale colour or if you are 
urinating less frequently and producing smaller amounts of urine with a dark colour. Also tell 
your doctor if you are losing weight or have experienced swelling of your feet, ankles, legs, 
hands or face. 
-
if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Bosulif
could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will 
be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.
-
if you have or have had pancreas problems. Tell your doctor if you develop abdominal pain 
or discomfort.
-
if you have any of these symptoms: serious skin rashes. Tell your doctor if you develop any 
of the following signs and symptoms of painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters 
and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g., mouth and lips). 
-
if you notice any of these symptoms: pain in your side, blood in your urine or reduced 
amount of urine. When your disease is very severe, your body may not be able to clear all the 
waste products from the dying cancer cells. This is called tumour lysis syndrome and can cause 
kidney failure and heart problems within 48 hours of the first dose of Bosulif. Your doctor will 
be aware of this and may ensure you are adequately hydrated and give you other medicines to 
help prevent it.
Sun/UV protection
You may become more sensitive to the sun or UV rays while taking bosutinib. It is important to cover 
sunlight-exposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF).
Children and adolescents
Bosulif is not recommended for people whose age is under 18 years. This medicine has not been 
studied in children and adolescents.

Bosulif with food and drink
Do not take Bosulif with grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as it may increase the risk of side effects.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

unborn baby. Ask your doctor for advice before taking Bosulif if you are pregnant or might become 
pregnant.
Women taking Bosulif will be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
1 month after the last dose. Vomiting or diarrhoea may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.
There is a risk that treatment with Bosulif will lead to decreased fertility and you may wish to seek 
advice about sperm storage before the treatment starts.
If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. Do not breast-feed during treatment with Bosulif as it could 
harm your baby.
Driving and using machines
If you experience dizziness, have blurred vision or feel unusually tired, do not drive or operate
machines until these side effects have gone away.
