Breyanzi contains the active substance lisocabtagene maraleucel, a type of treatment called 
 genetically modified cell therapy . </p>
<p>Breyanzi is made from your own white blood cells.This involves taking some of your blood and 
separating out the white blood cells and sending the white blood cells to a laboratory so that they can 
be modified to make Breyanzi. </p>
<p>What Breyanzi is used for 
Breyanzi is used to treat adults with a type of blood cancer called lymphoma which affects your lymph 
tissue and causes white blood cells to grow out of control. Breyanzi is used for: 
* diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
* high-grade B-cell lymphoma 
* primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma 
* follicular lymphoma grade 3B. </p>
<p>How Breyanzi works 
* Breyanzi cells have been genetically modified to recognise the lymphoma cells in your body. 
* When these cells are then introduced back into your blood, they can recognise and attack the 
lymphoma cells. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you 
may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. </li>
<li>if you cannot receive treatment, called lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which reduce the 
number of white blood cells in your blood (see also section 3, How Breyanzi is given). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before you are given Breyanzi you should tell your doctor if: 
* you have any lung or heart problems 
* you have low blood pressure 
* you have an infection or other inflammatory conditions. The infection will be treated before you 
are given Breyanzi 
* you have had a stem cell transplant from another person in the last 4 months   the transplanted 
cells can attack your body (graft-versus-host disease), causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody stools 
* you notice the symptoms of your cancer are getting worse. These symptoms include fever, 
feeling weak, night sweats, sudden weight loss 
* you have had hepatitis B or C, or human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection 
* you had a vaccination in the last 6 weeks or you are planning to have one in the next few 
months. See Live vaccines below for more information. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given Breyanzi. </p>
<p>Tests and checks 
Before you are given Breyanzi, your doctor will: 
* check your lungs, heart and blood pressure 
* look for signs of infection   any infection will be treated before you receive Breyanzi 
* look for signs of graft-versus-host disease, which can happen after a stem cell transplant from 
another person 
* check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. This will 
show if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome. You may be given 
medicines to help prevent the condition. 
* check if your cancer is getting worse 
* check for hepatitis B and C, and HIV infection </p>
<p>After you have been given Breyanzi 
* If you get certain serious side effects, you must tell your doctor or nurse straight away because 
you may need treatment for them. See section 4 under  Serious side effects . 
* Your doctor will regularly check your blood counts, as the number of blood cells may decrease. 
* Stay close to the treatment centre where you had Breyanzi for at least 4 weeks. See sections 3 
and 4. * Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. </p>
<p>You will be asked to enrol in a registry for at least 15 years in order to better understand the long-term 
effects of Breyanzi. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Breyanzi should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Breyanzi 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
including medicines taken without a prescription. 
See section 3 for information about the medicines you will be given before having Breyanzi. </p>
<p>Medicines that affect your immune system 
Before you are given Breyanzi tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
your immune system such as: 
* corticosteroids. 
This is because these medicines may reduce the effect of Breyanzi. </p>
<p>Other medicines that treat cancer 
Some anti-cancer medicines could reduce the effect of Breyanzi. Your doctor will consider if you need 
other cancer treatments. </p>
<p>Live vaccines 
You must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
* in the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of chemotherapy (called lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy) to prepare your body for Breyanzi. 
* during Breyanzi treatment 
* after treatment while your immune system is recovering. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine or lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The 
effects of Breyanzi in pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn 
baby or breast-fed child.<br />
* If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Breyanzi, talk to your 
doctor immediately. 
* You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Breyanzi should only be given if the 
result shows you are not pregnant. </p>
<p>Discuss the need for contraception with your doctor.  </p>
<p>Discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Breyanzi. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, use machines, or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 8 weeks after 
treatment. Breyanzi can make you sleepy, decrease awareness, and cause confusion and seizures (fits). </p>
<p>Breyanzi contains sodium, potassium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 
This medicine contains up to 12.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.6% of the recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult. Up to 8  vials 
of this medicine may be given per dose, which in total contains 100 mg sodium or 5% of the 
recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains up to 0.2 mmol (or 6.5 mg) potassium per dose. Your doctor will take this 
potassium content into consideration if your kidneys do not work properly or you are on a controlled 
potassium diet. </p>
<p>This medicine also contains DMSO which may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Giving blood to make Breyanzi from your white blood cells </p>
<p>Breyanzi is made from your own white blood cells </p>
<ul>
<li>Your doctor will take some of your blood by putting a tube (catheter) in your vein. Some of 
your white blood cells will be separated from your blood. The rest of your blood is returned to 
your body. This is called leukapheresis and can take 3 to 6 hours. This process may need to be 
repeated. </li>
<li>Your white blood cells will then be sent away to make Breyanzi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines you will be given before Breyanzi 
* A few days before you receive Breyanzi, you will be given a short course of chemotherapy. This 
is to clear away your existing white blood cells. 
* Shortly before you receive Breyanzi, you will be given paracetamol and an antihistamine 
medicine. This is to reduce the risk of infusion reactions and fever. </p>
<p>How Breyanzi is given 
* Your doctor will check that the Breyanzi was prepared from your own blood by checking that 
the patient identity information on the medicine labels matches your details. 
* Breyanzi is given by infusion (drip) through a tube into a vein. 
* You will receive infusions of the CD8 positive cells, followed immediately by infusions of the 
CD4 positive cells. The time for infusion will vary, but will usually be less than 15 minutes for 
each of the 2 cell types. </p>
<p>After Breyanzi is given 
* Stay close to the treatment centre where you received Breyanzi   for at least 4 weeks. 
* During the first week after treatment, you will need to return to the treatment centre 2 to 3 times 
so that your doctor can check that the treatment is working   and to help you with any side 
effects. See sections 2 and 4. If you miss an appointment 
Call your doctor or the treatment centre as soon as possible to make another appointment. </p>         </div>"""
