<p>Briumvi contains the active substance ublituximab. It is a type of protein called a monoclonal 
antibody. Antibodies work by attaching to specific targets in your body. </p>
<p>What Briumvi is used for </p>
<p>Briumvi is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), where the patient has 
flare-ups (relapses) followed by periods with milder or no symptoms. </p>
<p>What is Multiple Sclerosis </p>
<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects the central nervous system, especially the nerves in the brain and 
spinal cord. In MS, white blood cells called B cells that are part of the immune system (the body s 
defence system) work incorrectly and attack a protective layer (called myelin sheath) around nerve 
cells, causing inflammation and damage. Breakdown of the myelin sheath stops the nerves from 
working properly and causes symptoms of MS. Symptoms of MS depend on which part of the central 
nervous system is affected and can include problems with walking and balance, muscle weakness, 
numbness, double vision and blurring, poor coordination and bladder problems. </p>
<p>In relapsing forms of MS, the patient has repeated attacks of symptoms (relapses) that can appear 
suddenly within a few hours, or slowly over several days. The symptoms disappear or improve 
between relapses but damage may build up and lead to permanent disability. 
How does Briumvi work? </p>
<p>Briumvi works by attaching to a target called CD20 on the surface of B cells. B cells are a type of 
white blood cell which are part of the immune system. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system 
attacks the protective layer around nerve cells. B cells are involved in this process. Briumvi targets and 
removes the B cells and thereby reduces the chance of a relapse, relieves symptoms and slows down 
the progression of the disease. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to ublituximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6), </li>
<li>if you are suffering from a severe infection, </li>
<li>if you have been told that you have severe problems with your immune system, or </li>
<li>if you have cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are given Briumvi. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you are given Briumvi if any of the following apply to you. Your doctor 
may decide to delay your treatment with Briumvi, or may decide you cannot receive Briumvi if: </p>
<ul>
<li>you have an infection. Your doctor will wait until the infection is resolved before giving you 
Briumvi. </li>
<li>you have ever had hepatitis B or are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus. This is because medicines 
like Briumvi can cause the hepatitis B virus to become active again. Before your Briumvi 
treatment, your doctor will check if you are at risk of hepatitis B infection. Patients who have 
had hepatitis B or are carriers of the hepatitis B virus will have a blood test and will be 
monitored by a doctor for signs of hepatitis B infection. </li>
<li>you have recently been given any vaccine or might be given a vaccine in the near future. </li>
<li>you have cancer or if you have had cancer in the past. Your doctor may decide to delay your 
treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infusion-related reactions </p>
<ul>
<li>The most common side effect of Briumvi treatment are infusion-related reactions, types of 
allergic reactions that develop during or shortly after a medicine is given. These can be serious.  </li>
<li>Symptoms of an infusion-related reaction may include: </li>
</ul>
<p>itchy skin </p>
<p>hives </p>
<p>redness of the face or skin </p>
<p>throat irritation </p>
<p>trouble breathing </p>
<p>swelling of tongue or throat </p>
<p>wheezing </p>
<p>chills </p>
<p>fever </p>
<p>headache </p>
<p>dizziness </p>
<p>feeling faint </p>
<p>nausea </p>
<p>abdominal (belly) pain </p>
<p>rapid heartbeat. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have or think you may have any 
infusion-related reaction. Infusion-related reactions can happen during the infusion or up to 
24 hours after the infusion. </li>
<li>To reduce the risk of infusion-related reaction, your doctor will give you other medicines before 
each infusion of Briumvi (see section 3) and you will be closely monitored during the infusion. </li>
<li>If you get an infusion reaction, your doctor may need to stop or slow down the rate of infusion. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infections </p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor before you are given Briumvi if you have or think you have an infection. 
Your doctor will wait until the infection is resolved before giving you Briumvi. </li>
<li>You might get infections more easily with Briumvi. This is because the immune cells that 
Briumvi targets also help to fight infection.  </li>
<li>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have an infection or any of the following 
signs of infection during or after Briumvi treatment: </li>
</ul>
<p>fever or chills </p>
<p>cough that does not go away </p>
<p>herpes (such as cold sore, shingles or genital sores) 
* Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you think your MS is getting worse or if you 
notice any new symptoms. This is because of a very rare and life-threatening brain infection, 
called  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML), which can cause symptoms similar 
to those of MS. PML can occur in patients taking medicines like Briumvi, and other medicines 
used for treating MS. 
* Tell your partner or carer about your Briumvi treatment. They might notice symptoms of 
PML that you do not, such as memory lapses, trouble thinking, difficulty walking, sight loss, 
changes in the way you talk, which your doctor may need to investigate. </p>
<p>Vaccinations </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor if you have recently been given any vaccine or might be given a vaccine in the 
near future. </li>
<li>Your doctor will check if you need any vaccinations before you start your treatment with 
Briumvi. You should receive a type of vaccine called a live or live attenuated vaccines at least 
4 weeks before you start treatment with Briumvi. While you are being treated with Briumvi, you 
should not be given live or live attenuated vaccines until your doctor tells you that your immune 
system is no longer weakened.  </li>
<li>When possible, you should receive other types of vaccine called inactivated vaccines at least 
2 weeks before you start treatment with Briumvi. If you would like to receive any inactivated 
vaccines while you are being treated with Briumvi, talk to your doctor.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Briumvi is not intended to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years old. This is because it 
has not yet been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Briumvi </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular tell your doctor:<br />
<em> if you are taking, have recently taken or might take medicines that affect your immune system, 
such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressants (except corticosteroids) or other medicines used to 
treat MS. This is because these may have an added effect on the immune system.<br />
</em> if you plan to have any vaccinations (see  Warnings and Precautions  above). </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before you are given 
Briumvi. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor before being given Briumvi if you are pregnant, think that you might be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby. This is because Briumvi may cross the placenta and 
affect your baby. </li>
<li>Do not use Briumvi if you are pregnant unless you have discussed this with your doctor. Your 
doctor will consider the benefit of you taking Briumvi against the risk to your baby. </li>
<li>If you have a baby and you received Briumvi during your pregnancy, it is important to tell your 
baby s doctor about receiving Briumvi so they can recommend when your baby should get 
vaccinated. </li>
<li>It is not known whether Briumvi passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best 
way to feed your baby if you take Briumvi.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Contraception for women </p>
<p>If you are able to become pregnant (conceive), you must use contraception: 
* during treatment with Briumvi and 
* for at least 4 months after your last infusion of Briumvi. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Briumvi is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Briumvi contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free.  </p>         </div>"""
