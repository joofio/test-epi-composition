Bronchitol contains a medicine called mannitol which is a mucolytic agent. </p>
<p>What Bronchitol is used for 
Bronchitol is for use in adults 18 years of age and over. As well as using Bronchitol you will normally 
keep using the other medicines you take for cystic fibrosis.  </p>
<p>How Bronchitol works 
Bronchitol is inhaled into the lungs to help with cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease that affects the 
glands in the lungs, gut and pancreas that secrete fluids such as mucus and digestive juices. </p>
<p>Bronchitol helps by increasing the amount of water on the surface of your airways and in your mucus. 
This helps your lungs to clear mucus more easily. It also helps improve the condition of your lungs 
and your breathing. As a result you may get a  productive cough , which also helps to remove mucus 
from your lungs. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to mannitol<br />
- if you are sensitive to mannitol. Before you are started on Bronchitol, your doctor will check 
whether your airways are too sensitive to mannitol. If you are too sensitive to mannitol, your 
airways will become narrower, and you may find it harder to breathe. 
If either of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using this medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have asthma; </li>

<li>if you have severe cystic fibrosis, in particular if your lung function measured by the Forced 
Expiratory Volume in first second of expiration (FEV1) is usually less than 30%. </li>
</ul>
<p>Inhaling medicines can cause chest tightness and wheezing and this can happen immediately after 
taking this medicine. Your doctor will help you take your first dose of Bronchitol and check your lung 
function before, during and after dosing. Your doctor may ask you to use other medicines such as a 
bronchodilator before taking Bronchitol. </p>
<p>Inhaling medicines can also cause cough and this can happen with Bronchitol. Talk to your doctor if 
the cough won t go away or worries you. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Bronchitol should not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18. This is because there is 
limited information in this group of people. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Bronchitol 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>You can carry on using your medicines for cystic fibrosis when you are using Bronchitol, this includes 
inhaled antibiotics such as tobramycin and colistimethate sodium. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist before using Bronchitol. </p>
