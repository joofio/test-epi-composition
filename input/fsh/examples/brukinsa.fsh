  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>BRUKINSA is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance zanubrutinib. It belongs to a 
class of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking Bruton's tyrosine 
kinase, a protein in the body that helps cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking this protein, 
BRUKINSA reduces the number of cancer cells and slows down the worsening of the cancer. </p>
<p>BRUKINSA is used to treat Waldenstr m s macroglobulinaemia (also known as lymphoplasmacytic 
lymphoma), a cancer affecting a type of white blood cells called B lymphocytes or B cells that make 
too much of a protein called IgM. This medicine is used when the disease has come back, or treatment 
has not worked or in patients who cannot have chemotherapy together with an antibody. </p>
<p>BRUKINSA is also used to treat marginal zone lymphoma. This is a type of cancer that also affects B 
lymphocytes or B cells. In marginal zone lymphoma, the abnormal B cells multiply too quickly and 
live for too long. This may cause enlargement of organs that are part of body s natural defences such 
as lymph node and spleen. The abnormal B cells may also affect various organs, such as stomach, 
salivary gland, thyroid, eyes, lungs, bone marrow and blood. Patients may have fever, weight loss, 
tiredness and night sweats, but also symptoms that depend on where the lymphoma develop. This 
medicine is used when the disease has come back, or treatment has not worked.  </p>
<p>BRUKINSA is also used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), another type of cancer 
affecting B cells that involves the lymph nodes. This medicine is used in patients who have not 
previously been treated for CLL or when the disease has come back or has not responded to previous 
treatment. 
BRUKINSA is also used to treat follicular lymphoma (FL). FL is a slow growing cancer that affects 
the B lymphocytes. When you have FL, you have too many of these B lymphocytes in your lymph 
nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. BRUKINSA is taken together with another medicine called 
 obinutuzumab  when the disease has come back or when previously used medicines have not been 
effective. </p>         </div>"""

<li>if you are allergic to zanubrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking BRUKINSA: 
* if you have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements that 
increase your risk of bleeding (see section  Other medicines and BRUKINSA ). If you have 
had recent surgery or plan to have surgery, your doctor may ask you to stop taking 
BRUKINSA for a short time (3 to 7 days) before and after your surgery or dental procedure 
* if you have an irregular heartbeat or have a history of irregular heartbeat or severe heart 
failure, or if you have any of the following: shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, light-
headedness, fainting or near fainting, chest pain or swollen legs 
* if you have ever been advised that you are at higher risk of infections. You may experience 
viral, bacterial, or fungal infections during treatment with BRUKINSA with the following 
possible symptoms: fever, chills, weakness, confusion, body aches, cold or flu symptoms, feel 
tired or feel short of breath, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). 
* if you have ever had or might have hepatitis B. This is because BRUKINSA could cause 
hepatitis B to become active again. Patients will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs 
of this infection before treatment is started 
* if you have liver or kidney problems 
* if you have recently had any surgery, especially if it might affect how you absorb food or 
medicines from your stomach or gut 
* if you recently had low counts of red blood cells, infection-fighting cells or platelets in your 
blood 
* if you had other carcinomas in the past including skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma or 
squamous cell carcinoma). Please use sun protection </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Tests and check-ups before and during treatment<br />
Laboratory tests may show lymphocytosis, an increase in white blood cells (lymphocytes) in your 
blood in the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This does 
not necessarily mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood 
counts before and during the treatment and in rare cases the doctor may give you another medicine. 
Talk to your doctor about what your test results mean. 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast 
breakdown of cancer cells have occurred during treatment of cancer and sometimes even without 
treatment. This may lead to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor 
or another healthcare provider may do blood tests to check for TLS. 
Children and adolescents </p>
<p>BRUKINSA should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is unlikely to work.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and BRUKINSA </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and 
supplements. This is because BRUKINSA may affect the way some medicines work. Also, some 
medicines can affect the way BRUKINSA works. </p>
<p>BRUKINSA may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take 
other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes medicines such as: 
* acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as 
ibuprofen and naproxen, 
* anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin and other medicines for treating or preventing blood 
clots, 
* supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking BRUKINSA. </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines   The effects of BRUKINSA 
or other medicines may be influenced if you take BRUKINSA together with any of the following 
medicines: 
* antibiotics to treat bacterial infections   ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, 
erythromycin, nafcillin or rifampicin 
* medicines for fungal infections   fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
posaconazole, voriconazole 
* medicines for HIV infection   efavirenz, etravirine, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, telaprevir 
* medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy - aprepitant 
* medicines for depression   fluvoxamine, St. John s wort 
* medicine called kinase inhibitors for treatment of other cancers   imatinib 
* medicines for high blood pressure or chest pain   bosentan, diltiazem, verapamil<br />
<em> heart medicines/anti-arrhythmics   digoxin, dronedarone, quinidine<br />
</em> medicines to prevent seizures, to treat epilepsy, or to treat a painful condition of the face 
called trigeminal neuralgia   carbamazepine, mephenytoin, phenytoin<br />

you take BRUKINSA. This is because they can increase the amount of BRUKINSA in your 
blood. </p>

pregnancy. It is not known if BRUKINSA will harm your unborn baby. </p>

BRUKINSA and for least one month after treatment. A barrier method of contraception (e.g., 
condoms) must be used with hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills or devices.  </p>
