<ul>
<li>Budesonide belongs to a group of medicines called  corticosteroids  also known as  steroids .  It 
works by reducing and preventing swelling and inflammation in your lungs and helps you to 
breathe more easily.  </li>
<li>Formoterol fumarate dihydrate belongs to a group of medicines called  long-acting  2 
adrenoceptor agonists  or  bronchodilators .  It works by relaxing the muscles in your airways. 
This will help to open the airways and help you to breathe more easily. </li>
</ul>
<p>Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated for use in adults 18 years of age and 
older only.<br />
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is NOT indicated for use in children 12 years of age

<p>Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD).  </p>
<p>Asthma 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. can be prescribed for asthma in two different ways. </p>
<p>a)  You may be prescribed two asthma inhalers: Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
together with a separate  reliever inhaler  such as salbutamol. 
* Use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day.  This helps to prevent asthma 
symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use the  reliever inhaler  when you get asthma symptoms, to make it easier to breathe again.  </p>
<p>b)  You may be prescribed Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. as your only asthma 
inhaler. 
* Use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day.  This helps to prevent asthma 
symptoms such as breathlessness and wheezing from occurring.<br />
* Use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. when you need to take extra inhalations or puffs 
for relief of asthma symptoms, to make it easier to breathe again and if agreed with the doctor 
also to prevent asthma symptoms from happening (for example, when exercising or on exposure 
to allergens).  You do not need a separate inhaler for this.  </p>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
COPD is a long-term lung disease of the airways in the lungs, which is often caused by cigarette 
smoking.  Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest discomfort and coughing up mucus. 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. can also be used to treat the symptoms of severe COPD in 
adults.  </p> </div>"""

<p>Asthma<br />
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. can be prescribed for asthma in two different ways. The 
amount of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. to use and when to use it depends on how it has 
been prescribed for you.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have been prescribed Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. and a separate reliever

</ul>
<p>(A) Using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. and a separate  reliever inhaler   </p>
<p>Use your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day. This helps to prevent asthma 
symptoms from occurring. </p>
<p>Recommended dose:<br />
Adults (18 years and older) 
1 or 2 inhalations (actuations), twice a day, taken in the morning and in the evening<br />
Your doctor may increase this to 4 inhalations, twice a day. 
If your symptoms are well controlled, your doctor may ask you to take your medicine once a day. </p>
<p>Your doctor will help you to manage your asthma and will adjust the dose of this medicine to the 
lowest dose that controls your asthma.  If your doctor feels that you need a lower dose than is available 
from your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V., your doctor may prescribe an alternative inhaler 
containing the same active substances as your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. but with a 
lower dose of the corticosteroid. However, do not adjust the number of inhalations your doctor has 
prescribed without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Use your separate  reliever inhaler  to treat asthma symptoms when they happen.<br />
Always keep your  reliever inhaler  with you and use it to relieve sudden attacks of breathlessness and 
wheezing.  Do not use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. to treat these asthma symptoms. </p>
<p>(B) Using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. as your only asthma inhaler </p>

or 
2 inhalations in the morning<br />
or 
2 inhalations in the evening. </p>
<p>Your doctor may increase this to 2 inhalations twice a day.  </p>
<p>Also use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. as a  reliever inhaler  to treat asthma symptoms 
when they happen and to prevent asthma symptoms from happening (for example, when exercising or 
on exposure to allergens). <br />
<em> If you get asthma symptoms, take 1 inhalation and wait a few minutes. 
* If you do not feel better, take another inhalation.<br />
</em> Do not take more than 6 inhalations at a single time. </p>
<p>Always keep your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. with you and use it to relieve sudden 
attacks of breathlessness and wheezing. </p>
<p>A total daily dose of more than 8 inhalations is not normally needed.  However, your doctor may allow 
you to take up to 12 inhalations a day for a limited period.  </p>
<p>If you regularly need to use 8 or more inhalations a day, make an appointment to see your doctor.<br />
They may need to change your treatment.  </p>
<p>Do NOT use more than 12 inhalations in total in 24 hours. </p>
<p>If you are doing exercise and you get asthma symptoms, use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma

exercise to stop asthma symptoms from happening. </p>
<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) </p>
<p>Recommended dose: 
Adults (18 years and older): 
2 inhalations twice a day, taken in the morning and in the evening. </p>
<p>Your doctor may also prescribe another bronchodilator medicine, for example an anticholinergic (such 
as tiotropium or ipratropium bromide) for your COPD disease. </p>
<p>Preparing your new Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.  </p>
<p>Before using your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. for the first time, you need to prepare it 
for use as follows: 
* Open the foil pouch by tearing at the notch at the top of the foil pouch and take out the inhaler<br />
* Check the dose indicator to see that there are 120 inhalations in the inhaler. 
* Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label of the inhaler. 
* Do not shake your inhaler before use. </p>
<p>How to take an inhalation 
Every time you need to take an inhalation, follow the instructions below. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hold your inhaler with the semi-transparent wine red mouthpiece cover at the bottom. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the mouthpiece cover by folding it down until one loud click is heard. Your medicine is 
actively metered. Your inhaler is now ready for use. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe out through your inhaler. </p>
</li>
<li>Place the mouthpiece between your teeth. Do not bite the mouthpiece. Close your lips around 
the mouthpiece. Take care not to block the air vents. </li>
</ol>
<p>Breathe in through your mouth as deeply and as hard as you can. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove your inhaler from your mouth.  You may notice a taste when you take your inhalation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then breathe out gently (do not breathe out through the inhaler).  Close the mouthpiece 
cover.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are to take a second inhalation, repeat steps 1 to 7. Rinse your mouth with water after every dose, and spit it out.<br />
Do not try to take your inhaler apart, remove or twist the mouthpiece cover, it is fixed to your inhaler 
and must not be taken off.  Do not use your Spiromax if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has 
come apart from your Spiromax. Do not open and close the mouthpiece cover unless you are about to 
use your inhaler.<br />
Cleaning your Spiromax 
Keep your Spiromax dry and clean. 
If necessary you may wipe the mouthpiece of your Spiromax after use with a dry cloth or tissue. </p>
<p>When to start using a new Spiromax 
* The dose indicator tells you how many doses (inhalations) are left in your inhaler, starting with 
120 inhalations when it is full and ending with 0 (zero) inhalations when it is empty.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The dose indicator, on the rear of the device, shows the number of inhalations remaining as even 
numbers. The spaces between the even numbers represent the odd number of remaining 
inhalations. </li>
<li>For inhalations remaining from 20 downwards to  8 , 6 , 4 , 2  the numbers are displayed in red 
on a white background. When the numbers become red in the window, you should consult your 
doctor and obtain a new inhaler. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note:<br />
<em> The mouthpiece will still  click  even when your Spiromax is empty.<br />
</em> If you open and close the mouthpiece without taking an inhalation the dose indicator will still 
register it as a count.  This dose will be securely held inside the inhaler for when the next 
inhalation is due. It is impossible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one 
inhalation.<br />
* Keep the mouthpiece closed all the time unless you are about to use your inhaler.  </p>
<p>Important information about your asthma or COPD symptoms </p>
<p>If you feel you are getting breathless or wheezy while using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma 
B.V., you should continue to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. but go to see your doctor

* Your breathing is getting worse or you often wake up at night with breathlessness and 
wheezing.

<p>These signs could mean that your asthma or COPD is not being properly controlled and you may need 
different or additional treatment immediately. </p>
<p>Once your asthma is well controlled your doctor may consider it appropriate to gradually reduce the 
dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.. </p>

Pharma B.V. than you should are trembling, headache or a rapid heartbeat.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. If it is nearly time for your next dose just take your next dose at the 
usual time.  </p>
<p>If you become wheezy or breathless, or develop any other symptoms of an asthma attack, use your 
 reliever inhaler , then seek medical advice.  </p>
