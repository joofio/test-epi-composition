<p>Warnings and precautions 
Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is a potent cytotoxic medicine that results in profound decrease of blood cells. 
At the recommended dose, this is the desired effect. Therefore careful monitoring will be performed.  </p>
<p>It is possible that use of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi may increase the risk of suffering another 
malignancy in the future. You should tell your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a liver, kidney, heart or lung problem, </li>
<li>if you have a history of seizures, </li>
<li>if you are currently taking other medicines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cases of formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels may appear after hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT) with high-dose of your treatment in combination with other medicines. 
Other medicines and Busulfan Fresenius Kabi 
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi may interact with other medicines. </p>
<p>Particular caution should be taken if you use itraconazol and metronidazole (used for certain 
types of infections) or ketobemidone (used to treat pain) or deferasirox (a medicine used to 
remove excess iron from your body), because this may increase the side-effects. </p>
<p>The use of paracetamol during the 72 hours prior to or with Busulfan Fresenius Kabi administration 
should be used with caution. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

<p>Adequate contraceptive precautions should be used when either partner is receiving Busulfan Fresenius 
Kabi. </p>
<p>It may no longer be possible for you to achieve a pregnancy (infertility) after treatment with Busulfan 
Fresenius Kabi. If you are concerned about having children, you should discuss this with your doctor 
before treatment. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi can also produce symptoms of menopause and in 
pre-adolescent girls it can prevent the onset of puberty. </p>
<p>Men treated with Busulfan Fresenius Kabi are advised not to father child during and up to 6 months after

<p>PREPARATION GUIDE </p>
<p>Busulfan Fresenius Kabi 6 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion 
Busulfan </p>
<p>Read this guide prior to the preparation and administration of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi. </p>
<ol>
<li>PRESENTATION </li>
</ol>
<p>Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is supplied as a clear colourless viscous solution in 10 ml clear, colourless 
glass vials (type I). Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must be diluted prior to administration. </p>
<ol>
<li>RECOMMENDATION FOR SAFE HANDLING </li>
</ol>
<p>Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be considered. </p>
<p>All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical 
laminar flow safety hood. </p>
<p>As with other cytotoxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparing the busulfan 
solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of gloves and protective clothing is recommended. </li>
<li>If the concentrate or diluted busulfan solution contacts the skin or mucosa, wash them thoroughly 
with water immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Calculation of the quantity of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi to be diluted and of the diluent </p>
<p>Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must be diluted prior to use with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) 
solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%. </p>
<p>The quantity of the diluent must be 10 times the volume of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi ensuring the final 
concentration of busulfan remains at approximately 0.5 mg/ml. </p>
<p>The amount of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi and diluent to be administered would be calculated as follows: 
for a patient with a Y kg body weight: </p>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi: </li>
</ul>
<p>Y (kg) x D (mg/kg)  </p>
<p>= A ml of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi to be diluted </p>
<p>6 (mg/ml) </p>
<p>Y: body weight of the patient in kg 
D: dose of busulfan (see SPC section 4.2) </p>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of diluent: </li>
</ul>
<p>(A ml Busulfan Fresenius Kabi) x (10) = B ml of diluent </p>
<p>To prepare the final solution for infusion, add (A) ml of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi to (B) ml of diluent 
(sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%). </p>
<p>Preparation of the solution for infusion </p>
<p>Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must be prepared by a healthcare professional using sterile transfer techniques.<br />
* Using a non polycarbonate syringe fitted with a needle:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the calculated volume of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must be removed from the vial. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the contents of the syringe must be dispensed into an intravenous bag (or syringe) which 
already contains the calculated amount of the selected diluent. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must 
always be added to the diluent, not the diluent to the Busulfan Fresenius Kabi. Busulfan 
Fresenius Kabi must not be put into an intravenous bag that does not contain sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diluted solution must be mixed thoroughly by inverting several times. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After dilution, 1 ml of solution for infusion contains 0.5 mg of busulfan. </p>
<p>Diluted Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is a clear colourless solution </p>
<p>Instructions for use 
Prior to and following each infusion, flush the indwelling catheter line with approximately 5 ml of 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. </p>
<p>The residual medicinal product must not be flushed in the administration tubing as rapid infusion of 
busulfan has not been tested and is not recommended. </p>
<p>The entire prescribed busulfan dose should be delivered over two or three hours depending on the 
conditioning regimen. </p>
<p>Small volumes may be administered over 2 hours using electric syringes. In that case infusion sets with 
minimal priming space should be used (i.e 0.3-0.6 ml), primed with medicinal product solution prior to 
beginning the actual busulfan infusion and then flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution 
for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. </p>
<p>Busulfan must not be infused concomitantly with another intravenous solution.  </p>
<p>Due to incompatibility, do not use infusion components containing polycarbonate with busulfan. </p>
<p>For single use only. Only a clear solution without particles should be used. </p>
<p>Storage conditions 
Unopened vials: 
Store in a refrigerator (2 C   8 C). </p>
<p>Diluted solution: 
Chemical and physical in-use stability after dilution in glucose 5% or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) 
solution for injection has been demonstrated for 8 hours (including infusion time) after dilution when 
stored at 25 C   2 C or 12 hours after dilution when stored at 2 C-8 C followed by 3 hours stored at 
25 C   2 C (including infusion time). </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after dilution. 
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would 
normally not be longer than the above-mentioned conditions when dilution has taken place in controlled 
and validated aseptic conditions. 
Do not freeze the diluted solution. </p>
<ol>
<li>PROCEDURE FOR PROPER DISPOSAL </li>
</ol>
<p>Any unused medicinal product or waste should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements for 
cytotoxic medicinal products. </p>         </div>"""
