Caelyx pegylated liposomal is also used to treat cancer of the ovary. It is used to kill cancer cells, 
shrink the size of the tumour, delay the growth of the tumour, and extend your survival. </p>
<p>Caelyx pegylated liposomal is also used in combination with another medicine, bortezomib, to treat 
multiple myeloma (a cancer of the blood) in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. </p>
<p>Caelyx pegylated liposomal is also used to produce an improvement in your Kaposi s sarcoma 
including flattening, lightening and even shrinkage of the cancer. Other symptoms of Kaposi s 
sarcoma, such as swelling around the tumour, may also improve or disappear. </p>
<p>Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains a medicine which is able to interact with cells in such a way as to 
selectively kill cancer cells. The doxorubicin hydrochloride in Caelyx pegylated liposomal is enclosed 
in tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes which help to deliver the medicinal product from the blood 
stream to the cancerous tissue rather than healthy normal tissue. </p>         </div>"""

medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
You should tell your doctor about any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are receiving any treatment for heart disease or liver disease; </li>
<li>if you are diabetic, because Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains sugar which may require an 
adjustment to the treatment of your diabetes; </li>
<li>if you have Kaposi s sarcoma and have had your spleen removed; </li>
<li>if you notice sores, discolouration or any discomfort in your mouth. 
The cases of Interstitial lung diseases have been observed in patients receiving pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin including fatal cases. The symptoms of Interstitial lung disease are cough and shortness of 
breath sometimes with fever which are not caused by physical activity. Seek immediate medical 
attention, if you experience symptoms that may be signs of Interstitial lung disease. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is not known 
how the medicine will affect them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Caelyx pegylated liposomal 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist 
- if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained 
without a prescription; 
- about any other cancer treatments you are on or have been taking, as particular care needs to be 
taken with treatments which reduce the number of white blood cells, as this may cause further 
reduction in the number of white blood cells. If you are unsure about what treatments you have 
received or any illnesses you have had, discuss these with your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Because the active ingredient doxorubicin hydrochloride in Caelyx pegylated liposomal may cause 
birth defects, it is important to tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant.<br />
Women must avoid becoming pregnant and use contraception while taking Caelyx pegylated 
liposomal and in the eight months following discontinuation of Caelyx pegylated liposomal treatment.<br />
Men must use contraception while taking Caelyx pegylated liposomal and in the six months following 
discontinuation of Caelyx pegylated liposomal, so that their partner does not become pregnant. 
Because doxorubicin hydrochloride may be harmful to nursing infants, women must discontinue 
breast-feeding before starting treatment with Caelyx pegylated liposomal. Health experts recommend 
that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid 
transmission of HIV. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel tired or sleepy from treatment with Caelyx 
pegylated liposomal. </p>
<p>Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains soya oil and sodium 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains soya oil.  If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this 
medicine. 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say 
 essentially sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much Caelyx pegylated liposomal is given 
If you are being treated for breast cancer or ovarian cancer, Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be 
administered at a dose of 50 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and 
weight). The dose is repeated every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and you are 
able to tolerate the treatment. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your body 
surface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 4 of the 
bortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The dose is repeated as long as 
you respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for Kaposi sarcoma, Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be administered at a 
dose of 20 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight). The dose 
is repeated every 2 to 3 weeks for 2-3 months, then as often as necessary to maintain an improvement 
in your condition. </p>
<p>How Caelyx pegylated liposomal is given 
Caelyx pegylated liposomal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip (infusion) into a vein. 
Depending on the dose and indication, this may take from 30 minutes to more than one hour (i.e., 
90 minutes). </p>
<p>If you use more Caelyx pegylated liposomal than you should 
Acute overdosing worsens side effects like sores in the mouth or decreases the number of white blood 
cells and platelets in the blood. Treatment will include administration of antibiotics, platelet cell 
transfusions, use of factors which stimulate production of white blood cells and symptomatic treatment 
of mouth sores. </p>

<ul>
<li>you develop fever, feel tired, or if you have signs of bruising or bleeding (very common) </li>
<li>redness, swelling, peeling or tenderness, mainly on the hands or feet ( hand-foot  syndrome). 
These effects have been seen very commonly and are sometimes severe. In severe cases, these 
effects may interfere with certain daily activities, and may last for 4 weeks or longer before 
resolving completely. The doctor may wish to delay the start and/or reduce the dose of the next 
treatment (see Strategies to prevent and treat hand foot syndrome, below) </li>

<li>infections (common), including lung infections (pneumonia) or infections that may affect your 
vision </li>
<li>being short of breath (common) </li>
<li>severe stomach pain (common) </li>

<li>severe allergic reaction that may include a swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat; difficulty 
swallowing or breathing; itchy rash (hives) (uncommon) </li>

rare cases, having low white blood cells may lead to severe infection. Anaemia (reduction in red 
blood cells) may cause tiredness, and decreased platelets in the blood may increase the risk of 
bleeding. It is because of the potential changes in your blood cells that you will have regular 
blood tests.
