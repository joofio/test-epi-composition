CAMZYOS contains the active substance mavacamten. Mavacamten is a reversible cardiac myosin 
inhibitor, meaning that it changes the action of the muscle protein myosin in heart muscle cells. </p>
<p>What CAMZYOS is used for 
CAMZYOS is used to treat adults with a type of heart disease called obstructive hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (oHCM). </p>
<p>About obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition where the walls of the left heart chamber 
(ventricle) contract harder and become thicker than normal. As the walls thicken they can block 
(obstruct) the flow of blood out of the heart and can also make the heart stiff. This obstruction makes it 
more difficult for blood to flow into and out of the heart and be pumped to the body with each 
heartbeat, a condition known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Symptoms of 
oHCM are: chest pain and shortness of breath (especially with physical exercise); tiredness, abnormal 
heart rhythms, dizziness, feeling that you are about to faint, fainting (syncope) and swelling of the 
ankles, feet, legs, abdomen and/or veins in the neck. </p>
<p>How CAMZYOS works 
CAMZYOS works by reducing excess contraction of the heart and the obstruction to blood flow to the 
body. As a result, it may improve your symptoms and your ability to be active. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take CAMZYOS if: 
* you are allergic to mavacamten or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* you are pregnant or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. 
* if you are taking medicines which may increase the level of CAMZYOS in your blood such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>oral medicines to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
posaconazole, voriconazole, </li>
<li>certain medicines to treat bacterial infections such as the antibiotics clarithromycin, </li>
<li>certain medicines to treat HIV infection such as cobicistat, ritonavir, </li>
<li>certain medicines to treat cancer such as ceritinib, idelalisib, tucatinib. 
Ask your doctor if the medicine you are taking prevents you from taking mavacamten. See section 
 Other medicines and CAMZYOS  </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Routine tests 
Your doctor will assess how well your heart is working (your heart function) using an echocardiogram 
(an ultrasound test that takes images of your heart) before your first dose and regularly during 
treatment with CAMZYOS. It is very important to keep these echocardiogram appointments, because 
your doctor needs to check the effect of CAMZYOS on your heart. Your treatment dose may need to 
be adjusted to improve your response or to reduce side effects. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant your doctor may perform a pregnancy test before 
starting treatment with CAMZYOS. 
Your doctor may do a test to check how this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in your body as 
this may be used to guide your CAMZYOS treatment (see section 3). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist straight away: 
* if you get any of these symptoms during your treatment with CAMZYOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>new or worsening shortness of breath, </li>
<li>chest pain, </li>
<li>tiredness, </li>
<li>palpitations (a forceful heartbeat that may be rapid or irregular), or </li>
<li>leg swelling. 
These could be signs and symptoms of systolic dysfunction, a condition where the heart cannot 
pump with enough force, which can be life-threatening and lead to heart failure. </li>
<li>if you develop a serious infection or irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) as this could increase your 
risk of developing heart failure. 
Your doctor may need to do additional tests of your heart function, interrupt the treatment or change 
your dose, depending on how you feel. </li>
</ul>
<p>Women of childbearing potential 
If used during pregnancy, CAMZYOS can harm the unborn baby. Before you start treatment with 
CAMZYOS your doctor will explain the risk to you and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to 
ensure that you are not pregnant. Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not 
become pregnant while taking CAMZYOS. It also explains what you should do to avoid becoming 
pregnant while you are taking CAMZYOS. You must use effective contraception during treatment and 
for 6 months after stopping treatment (see section  Pregnancy and breastfeeding ). 
If you do become pregnant while taking CAMZYOS, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
stop treatment (see  If you stop taking CAMZYOS  in section 3). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children (aged below 18 years) because the effectiveness and safety of 
CAMZYOS have not been studied in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CAMZYOS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because some other medicines can affect the way CAMZYOS works. 
Some medicines can increase the amount of CAMZYOS in your body and make it more likely for you 
to get side effects that may be severe. Other medicines can reduce the amount of CAMZYOS in your 
body and may reduce its beneficial effects. 
In particular, before taking CAMZYOS tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently 
taken, or have changed the dose of any of the following medicines: 
* some medicines used to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces (cimetidine, 
omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole) 
* antibiotics for bacterial infections (such as clarithromycin, erythromycin) 
* medicines used to treat fungal infections (such as itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, 
posaconazole and voriconazole) 
* medicines used to treat depression (such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram) 
* medicines for HIV infections (such as ritonavir, cobicistat, efavirenz) 
* rifampicin (an antibiotic for bacterial infections like tuberculosis) 
* apalutamide, enzalutamide, mitotane, ceritinib, idelalisib, ribociclib, tucatinib (medicines used 
to treat certain types of cancer) 
* medicines for fits (seizures) or epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
primidone) 
* St. John s wort (a herbal medicine for depression) 
* medicines that affect your heart (such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers e.g. 
verapamil and diltiazem) 
* medicines that make your heart more resistant to abnormal activity (such as sodium channel 
blockers e.g. disopyramide) 
* ticlopidine (a medicine to prevent heart attack and stroke) 
* letermovir (a medicine to treat cytomegalovirus infections) 
* norethindrone (a medicine to treat various menstrual problems) 
* prednisone (steroid). </p>
<p>If you take or have taken any of these medicines, or have changed the dose, your doctor needs to 
closely monitor you, may need to change your dose of CAMZYOS, or consider alternative treatments. </p>
<p>If you are not sure whether you are taking any of the medicines mentioned above, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking CAMZYOS. Before stopping or changing the dose of a medicine or starting 
a new medicine, tell your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Do not take any of the above medicines occasionally or once in a while (not on a regular schedule) 
since that could change the amount of CAMZYOS in your body. </p>
<p>CAMZYOS with food and drink 
You should use caution when drinking grapefruit juice while on treatment with CAMZYOS as it may 
change the amount of CAMZYOS in your body. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not take CAMZYOS during pregnancy, for 6 months before getting pregnant, or if you are a 
woman who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. CAMZYOS may 
cause harm to your unborn baby. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will 
inform you about this risk and will check if you are pregnant before starting treatment and regularly 
during treatment. Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become 
pregnant while taking CAMZYOS. If you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to 
become pregnant while taking CAMZYOS, tell your doctor right away. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if CAMZYOS passes through breastmilk. You must not breast-feed while taking 
CAMZYOS. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Mavacamten may have a small effect on your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel dizzy 
while taking this medicine, do not drive a vehicle, cycle or use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>CAMZYOS contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much to take 
The recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg or 5 mg taken by mouth once daily. Your doctor may do a 
test to check how this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in your body. The result may guide your 
CAMZYOS treatment. If you have liver problems, your doctor may also prescribe a reduced starting

<p>Your doctor will monitor how well your heart is working while you are taking CAMZYOS using 
echocardiograms and may change your dose (increase, lower, or temporarily stop) based on the 
results. </p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much CAMZYOS to take. 
Your doctor will prescribe you a single daily dose of either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg. The

doctor has prescribed to ensure that you receive the correct amount of CAMZYOS. </p>
<p>Always take CAMZYOS as prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>The first echocardiogram will be done before you start treatment, and then again during follow-up 
visits at week 4, 8 and 12 to assess your response to CAMZYOS. Routine echocardiograms will then 
be done every 12 weeks. If your doctor changes your dose of CAMZYOS at any point, an 
echocardiogram will be done 4 weeks afterwards to make sure you are receiving a beneficial dose. </p>
