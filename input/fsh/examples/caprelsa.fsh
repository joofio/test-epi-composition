tear in a blood vessel wall.

may be restarted once adequate wound healing is established.

<p>Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) / toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in association with vandetanib treatment. Stop using 
Caprelsa and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to these 
serious skin reactions described in section 4. Determination of RET status of your cancer will be needed, before initiating Caprelsa treatment. </p>
<p>Monitoring of your blood and your heart: 
Your doctor or nurse should perform tests to check the levels of your blood potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as the electrical activity of your heart 
with a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG). You should have these tests:<br />
<em> Before starting Caprelsa<br />

<em> 1, 3 and 6 weeks after starting Caprelsa<br />
</em> 12 weeks after starting Caprelsa<br />

medicines, including medicines that you buy without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Caprelsa can affect the way some medicines work and some medicines can have an effect on 
Caprelsa. </p>

<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
