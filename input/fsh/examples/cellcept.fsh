Mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you 
must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice 
given to you by your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of 
mycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before you 
take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under  Warnings and precautions  and 
 Pregnancy and breast-feeding . </p>
<p>Do not take CellCept: 
* If you are allergic to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* If you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test 
before your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. 
* If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant 
* If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). 
* If you are breast-feeding. 
Do not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking CellCept. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with CellCept: 
* If you are older than 65 years as you may have an increased risk of developing adverse events 
such as certain viral infections, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary oedema when compared 
to younger patients 
* If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat<br />
* If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
* If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer 
* If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are taking 
CellCept 
* If you have a hereditary enzyme deficiency such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller 
syndrome </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting 
treatment with CellCept. </p>
<p>The effect of sunlight 
CellCept reduces your body s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the 
amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
* wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
* using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years because based on the limited safety and 
efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. </p>
<p>Other medicines and CellCept 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes 
medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because CellCept can affect 
the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect the way CellCept works. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before you 
start CellCept: 
* azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system   given after a transplant 
operation 
* cholestyramine   used to treat high cholesterol 
* rifampicin   an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) 
* antacids or proton pump inhibitors   used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion 
* phosphate binders   used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate gets 
absorbed into their blood 
* antibiotics   used to treat bacterial infections<br />
* isavuconazole   used to treat fungal infections 
* telmisartan   used to treat high blood pressure </p>
<p>Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while taking CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
first. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. </p>
<p>You must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment. </p>
<p>CellCept with food and drink 
Taking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with CellCept. </p>
<p>Contraception in women taking CellCept 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception with 
CellCept. This includes: 
* Before you start taking CellCept 
* During your entire treatment with CellCept<br />
* For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. 
Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not have been effective 
or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. </p>
<p>You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
* You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago (if 
your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance 
you could become pregnant) 
* Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy) 
* Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
* Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist 
gynaecologist) 
* You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY 
genotype, Turner s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
* You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. </p>
<p>Contraception in men taking CellCept 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father 
takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or your female 
partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days after you stop 
taking CellCept.  </p>
<p>If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative therapies. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks in 
case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant organ if: 
* You plan to become pregnant. 
* You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
* You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - 27%) 
in the unborn baby. Birth defects that have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, of face (cleft 
lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat with the 
stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the spine are not 
properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor may 
request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can pass 
into the mother s milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
CellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines until 
you feel better. </p>
<p>CellCept contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Talk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects   you may need 
urgent medical treatment: 
* you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
* you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
* you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may 
be having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). </p>
<p>Usual problems 
Some of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection and 
vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: 
* the number of your blood cells or signs of infections </p>
<p>Children may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, 
fewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. </p>
<p>Fighting infections 
CellCept reduces your body s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your 
body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections than 
usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary system.  </p>
<p>Lymph and skin cancer 
As can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of 
patients on CellCept have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  </p>
<p>General unwanted effects 
You may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic reactions 
(such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such as stomach, 
chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  </p>
<p>Other unwanted effects may include: 
Skin problems such as:<br />
* acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth, hair loss, rash, itching. </p>
<p>Urinary problems such as:<br />
* blood in the urine. </p>
<p>Digestive system and mouth problems such as:<br />
<em> swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, 
* inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach,<br />
</em> gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, 
* liver disorder,<br />
* diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. </p>
<p>Nervous system problems such as:<br />
<em> feeling dizzy, drowsy or numb,<br />
</em> tremor, muscle spasms, convulsions,<br />
* feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. </p>
<p>Heart and blood vessel problems such as: 
* change in blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat widening of blood vessels. </p>
<p>Lung problems such as:<br />
<em> pneumonia, bronchitis,<br />
</em> shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung 
airways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor if 
you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness.<br />
* fluid on the lungs or inside the chest, 
* sinus problems. </p>
<p>Other problems such as:<br />
* weight loss, gout, high blood sugar, bleeding, bruising.  </p>
