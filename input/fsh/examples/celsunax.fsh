illness. 
Celsunax contains the active substance ioflupane (123I) which is used to help identify (diagnose) 
conditions in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called  radiopharmaceuticals , which contain 
a small amount of radioactivity. </p>
<ul>
<li>When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a 
short time. </li>
<li>Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body using 
special cameras. </li>
<li>A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is 
inside the organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information about how that organ 
is working. </li>
</ul>
<p>When Celsunax is injected into an adult, it is carried around the body in the blood. It collects in a small 
area of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in:</p>
<ul>
<li>parkinsonism (including Parkinson s disease) and </li>
<li>dementia with Lewy bodies. </li>
</ul>
<p>A scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may 
feel that the scan would help in finding out more about your condition and deciding on possible 
treatment. </p>
<p>When Celsunax is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than in 
some types of X-ray investigation. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the 
clinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to 
these small amounts of radiation. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). 
- if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using this medicine if you have a moderate or severe 
problem with your kidneys or liver. </p>
<p>Before you are given Celsunax you should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination 
in order to urinate as often as possible during the first hours after the study. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Celsunax is not recommended for children and adolescents below 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Celsunax 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.<br />
Some medicines or substances can affect the way that this medicine works. 
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>buproprion (used to treat depression (sadness)), </li>
<li>benzatropine (used to treat Parkinson s disease), </li>
<li>mazindol (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity), </li>
<li>sertraline (used to treat depression (sadness)), </li>
<li>methylphenidate (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness)), </li>
<li>phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity), </li>
<li>amfetamine (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness); also a 
substance of abuse), </li>
<li>cocaine (sometimes used as an anaesthetic for nose surgery; also a substance of abuse). </li>
</ul>
<p>Some medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may ask you to stop taking 
them for a short time before you receive Celsunax. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Do not use Celsunax if you are pregnant or think you may possibly be pregnant. This is because the 
child may receive some of the radioactivity. Alternative techniques which do not involve radioactivity 
should be considered. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of Celsunax, or ask you to 
stop breast-feeding. It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is passed into breast milk. </p>
<ul>
<li>You should not breast-feed your child for 3 days after Celsunax is given. </li>
<li>Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away any 
breast milk you have expressed. </li>
<li>You will need to continue to do this for 3 days, until the radioactivity is no longer in your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Celsunax has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Celsunax contains alcohol (ethanol): up to 197 mg of alcohol in each dose which is equivalent to 
39.5 mg/mL (5% by volume). The amount in 5 mL of this medicine is equivalent to 5 mL beer or 2 mL 
wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical medicines. Celsunax will 
always be used in a hospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who 
are trained and qualified to use it safely. They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Your nuclear medicine doctor will decide which dose of Celsunax is best for you. It will be the smallest 
quantity necessary to get the desired information. </p>
<p>Before you receive Celsunax, your nuclear medicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liquid 
that contain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building-up in your thyroid gland. It is important that 
you take the tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you. </p>
<p>Administration of Celsunax and conduct of the procedure<br />
Celsunax is given to you as an injection, usually into a vein in your arm. The recommended 
radioactivity given by injection is between 110 to 185 MBq (megabequerel or MBq is a unit used to 
measure radioactivity). A single injection is enough. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
The camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours after the injection of this medicine. Your nuclear 
medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. </p>
<p>After administration of Celsunax, you should urinate frequently in order to eliminate the medicine 
from your body. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving 
this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor, if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you are given more Celsunax than you should 
Since Celsunax is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an 
overdose. Your nuclear medicine doctor will suggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get 
rid of the medicine. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass - your doctor will tell 
you what to do. This is normal practice with medicines like Celsunax. Any ioflupane (123I) which 
remains in your body will naturally lose its radioactivity. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who 
supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""

radiation is associated with the least risk of cancer and hereditary abnormalities. It will be passed out of 
the body in a few days without need for you to take special precautions. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this
