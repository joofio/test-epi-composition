<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Before treatment with CEVENFACTA, tell your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a history of atherosclerosis (when your arteries are narrowed by disease), coronary 
artery disease (heart disease due to narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the heart), 
cerebrovascular disease (disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain), a crush injury, 
septicaemia (serious blood infection) or blood clots; </li>
<li>If you have heart disease, heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms;  </li>
<li>If you had prior pulmonary (lungs) clots or heart surgery; </li>
<li>If you have or have had any other medical condition. </li>
</ul>
<p>Patients with known allergy to casein may be at a higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Should 
signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, treatment should be discontinued and you should seek 
immediate medical attention. Symptoms may include hives (itchy swellings under the skin), itching, 
rash, difficulty breathing, swelling around the mouth and throat, tightness of the chest, wheezing, 
dizziness or fainting, and low blood pressure. </p>
<p>Although the following conditions have not been observed, they may occur with CEVENFACTA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood clots in arteries in the heart (which could lead to a heart attack or angina), in the brain 
(which could lead to a stroke), or in the lungs or deep veins. Symptoms may include swelling and 
pain in the arms, legs or abdomen, chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of feeling or movement, 
and altered consciousness or speech. </li>
<li>Hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions. Symptoms may include hives (itchy swellings under 
the skin), itching, rash, difficulty breathing, swelling around the mouth and throat, tightness of the 
chest, wheezing, dizziness or fainting, and low blood pressure. </li>
<li>Inhibitors (antibodies) which may cause bleeding problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these conditions apply to you, talk to your doctor before using CEVENFACTA. </p>
<p>It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your CEVENFACTA. So, every time you get a 
new package of CEVENFACTA, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after Lot) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Adolescents<br />
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older). </p>
<p>Other medicines and CEVENFACTA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>You should talk to your doctor before using CEVENFACTA if 
- you are taking or have recently taken another activated Factor VII, or activated or non-activated 
prothrombin complex concentrates, 
- you are taking or have recently taken Factor XIII,<br />
since the combination of these medicines with CEVENFACTA may increase the risk of 
thromboembolic events (formation of blood clots in the veins).  </p>
<p>You should talk to your doctor before using CEVENFACTA with these medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially 
 sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

treatment of haemophilia and/or bleeding disorders. 
CEVENFACTA comes as a powder that must be made up (reconstituted) with its solvent and injected 
into a vein (intravenous injection). See instructions for use guide at the end of this leaflet (section 7). </p>
<p>When to treat yourself 
Injecting medicines requires special training. Do not attempt to self-inject unless you have been taught 
how to by your healthcare provider or haemophilia treatment centre.  </p>
<p>Many people with inhibitors learn to self-inject or inject with the help of a family member: once 
trained, you will need additional injection equipment along with your CEVENFACTA kit so that you 
can successfully treat your bleeding episodes at home. Be sure to collect all necessary injection 
equipment before preparing the medicine for injection. This additional injection equipment will be 
provided by your healthcare professional (e.g., your pharmacist or haemophilia treatment centre). </p>
<p>CEVENFACTA may be injected at a haemophilia treatment centre, at your healthcare provider s 
office, or at home. Treating at the first sign of a bleed is important for bleed management.  </p>
<p>Start treatment of a bleed as early as possible, ideally within 2 hours.<br />
  In cases of a mild or moderate bleed (e.g., joint, superficial muscle, soft tissue, and mucous 
membranes), you should treat yourself as early as possible, ideally at home.<br />
  In case of a severe bleed (e.g., life or limb [arm or leg] threatening haemorrhage, intracranial [within 
the skull] or gastrointestinal [in the stomach or gut] haemorrhage) you should contact your doctor.  </p>
<p>Usually, severe bleeds are treated at the hospital and a dose of CEVENFACTA can be given on the 
way there.  </p>
<p>Do not treat yourself for longer than 24 hours without consulting your doctor.<br />
  Each time you use this medicine tell your healthcare provider as soon as possible.<br />
  If bleeding is not controlled within 24 hours, contact your healthcare provider or emergency services 
immediately. You will usually need hospital care. </p>
<p>For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, follow the 
Instructions For Use guide at the end of this leaflet (section 7). <br />
Inject the solution into your vein over 2 minutes or less. </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are 
not sure. </p>
<p>Dose 
Your healthcare provider will tell you how much CEVENFACTA to use, and when to use this 
medicine based on your weight, condition and type of bleed. </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding episodes 
Treatment with this medicine should be started as soon as a bleeding event occurs. </p>
<p>Mild and moderate bleeding </p>
<p>For mild to moderate bleeding episodes, treatment at home should not last longer than 24 hours. 
Continuing home treatment after 24 hours can only be considered after consultation with the 
haemophilia treatment centre. </p>
<p>Severe bleeding  </p>
<p>You should seek immediate medical care if signs or symptoms of severe bleeding occur at home.<br />
An initial dose can be administered on your way to the haemophilia treatment centre or your 
healthcare provider s office to avoid any treatment delay. </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor has told you. Check 
with your doctor if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Method of administration 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration and instructions on 
administration, follow the Instructions For Use guide at the end of this leaflet (section 7).   </p>
<p>If you use more CEVENFACTA than you should 
If you use too much CEVENFACTA, get medical advice at once. </p>
<p>If you forget to use CEVENFACTA,<br />
If you forget to use CEVENFACTA, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
