lower the level of cholesterol in your blood. Your doctor should only give you Cholestagel if a diet 
low in fat and cholesterol did not work well enough on its own. </p>
<p>Cholestagel works in your intestinal system by binding bile acids produced by your liver and carrying 
the bile acids out of your body with your faeces. This prevents your body from recycling the bile acids 
from your intestines in the usual way. Without the recycling process, your liver has to make additional 
bile acids. Your liver uses cholesterol from your blood to do this, which lowers the level of cholesterol 
in your blood. </p>
<p>Cholestagel is prescribed to treat a condition known as primary hypercholesterolaemia (when 
cholesterol in the blood is elevated) in adults. 
- Cholestagel may be prescribed on its own in addition to a diet low in fat and cholesterol when 
treatment with a statin (a class of cholesterol-lowering medicines that work in the liver) is 
inappropriate or not well tolerated.<br />
- Cholestagel may be used together with a statin and the diet low in fat and cholesterol when 
patients are not appropriately controlled by the statin on its own.<br />
- Cholestagel may also be used together with ezetimibe (a cholesterol-lowering medicine that works 
by reducing cholesterol absorption from the gut), with or without a statin. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to colesevelam or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) </li>
<li>if you have a blockage in your intestines or bile ducts (tubes that carry bile) </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are prescribed Cholestagel and any other medicine together you must also read the patient 
information leaflet that comes with that particular medicine before you start to take your medicine.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cholestagel 
- if your triglyceride levels (a blood fat) are greater than 3.4 mmol/L 
- if you have difficulty in swallowing, or have a major stomach or intestinal disorder 
- if you suffer from constipation, as Cholestagel may induce or worsen this condition. This is 
especially important for patients with coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. </p>
<p>If you think any of these apply to you, you should inform your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Cholestagel. </p>
<p>Before starting therapy with Cholestagel, your physician should make sure that certain conditions do 
not contribute to your elevated cholesterol levels. These could include poorly controlled diabetes, 
untreated hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone for which no treatment is being given 
currently), proteins in urine (nephrotic syndrome), altered protein levels in the blood 
(dysproteinaemias), and blockage of the bile transport to your gall bladder (obstructive liver disease). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) has not been studied. Therefore, 
Cholestagel is not recommended for use in this population. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cholestagel 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
If your doctor suspects that Cholestagel may have an effect on the absorption of the other medication, 
you may be advised to take Cholestagel at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after taking the other 
medication. If you need to take other medicines more than once a day, remember that your Cholestagel 
tablets can be taken once a day. </p>
<p>Cholestagel may affect the way in which the following medicines work: 
* Anticoagulant therapy (medicines, such as warfarin, used to thin blood).  If you are taking 
anticoagulant therapy you should consult with your physician to closely monitor 
anticoagulation levels, as Cholestagel may affect the absorption of vitamin K and therefore 
interfere with the activity of warfarin. 
* Thyroid replacement therapy (medicines, such as thyroxine or levothyroxine, used to treat low 
thyroid hormone levels) 
* Oral contraceptives (medicines to prevent pregnancy) 
It is important you take Cholestagel at least 4 hours after you take the oral contraceptive to 
ensure that the effectiveness of the contraceptive is not affected. 
* Verapamil or olmesartan (medicines used to treat high blood pressure). It is important that you 
take olmesartan at least 4 hours before you take Cholestagel. 
* Antidiabetic medications (medicines used to treat diabetes, such as metformin 
extended-release (ER) tablets, glimepiride, glipizide, pioglitazone, repaglinide or glyburide). 
If you are taking medicines for diabetes, you should consult with your physician so that you 
can be closely monitored. It is important that you take glimepiride and glipizide at least 4 
hours before you take Cholestagel. 
* Anti-epileptic medicines (medicines, such as phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy).<br />
<em> Ciclosporin (a medicine used to suppress the immune system).<br />
</em> Ursodeoxycholic acid (a medicine used to dissolve gallstones or treat specific chronic liver 
diseases). 
If you are going to take Cholestagel and one of these medicines, your doctor may want to do tests to 
make sure that Cholestagel does not interfere with these medicines.  </p>
<p>Additionally, if you have any condition that could cause you to have a deficiency of vitamins A, D, E 
or K, your doctor may want to check your vitamin levels periodically while you are taking 
Cholestagel. If necessary, your doctor may advise you to take vitamin supplements. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are prescribed Cholestagel and a statin together it is important that you tell your doctor if you 
are pregnant or if you are planning to become pregnant because statins must not be used during 
pregnancy; the patient information leaflet that comes with that particular statin should be consulted. 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Your doctor may stop your medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your ability to drive or operate machines is not affected by taking Cholestagel tablets. </p>         </div>"""

and you should continue this diet during treatment. </p>
<p>Always take Cholestagel exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are unsure. As described in Section 2, if you will be taking Cholestagel along with 
another medicine it is possible that your doctor will advise you to take Cholestagel at least 4 hours 
before or at least 4 hours after taking the other medicine. 
If you take a medicine called either Neoral  or ciclosporin, please ensure to take it with Cholestagel in 
a consistent pattern over the day; either always together or always separate for a set number of hours. </p>
<p>You should take your Cholestagel tablets with food and liquid. The tablets should be swallowed 
whole. Do not break, crush or chew the tablets. </p>
<p>Combination therapy: 
The recommended dose for Cholestagel, when used with a statin or ezetimibe or both together, is 4 to 
6 tablets a day by mouth. Your doctor may tell you to take the Cholestagel dose either once a day or 
twice a day; in either case Cholestagel should be taken with a meal. The dosing of the statin and the 
ezetimibe should follow the instructions for that particular medicine. The medicines may be taken at 
the same time or at separate times according to what your doctor has prescribed. </p>
<p>Monotherapy: 
The recommended dose for Cholestagel is 3 tablets taken twice a day with meals or 6 tablets a day 
with a meal. Your doctor may increase your dose to 7 tablets per day. </p>
<p>If you take more Cholestagel than you should 
Please contact your doctor. Constipation or bloating could occur. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Cholestagel 
You may take your dose with a later meal, but never take in one day more than the total number of 
tablets that your doctor has prescribed to you in a single day. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Cholestagel 
Your cholesterol may increase to the level it was before treatment was started. </p>
