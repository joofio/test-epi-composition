  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Cholib contains two different active substances: fenofibrate (belongs to the group called  fibrates ) 
and simvastatin (belongs to the group called  statins ). They are both used to lower levels of total 
cholesterol,  bad  cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), and fatty substances called triglycerides in the blood. 
In addition, they both raise levels of  good  cholesterol (HDL cholesterol).
What should I know about cholesterol and triglycerides?
Cholesterol is one of several fats found in your blood. Your total cholesterol is made up mainly of
LDL and HDL cholesterol.
LDL cholesterol is often called  bad  cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of your arteries
and form plaque. Over time, this plaque build-up can lead to a clogging of your arteries.
HDL cholesterol is often called  good  cholesterol because it helps keep the  bad  cholesterol from
building up in the arteries and because it protects against heart disease.
Triglycerides are another fat in your blood. They may raise your risk of having heart problems.
In most people, there are no signs of cholesterol or triglycerides problems at first. Your doctor can 
measure your lipids with a simple blood test. Visit your doctor regularly to keep track of your lipids 
level.
Cholib is used in adults at high risk of problems like heart attack and stroke who have high blood 
levels of 2 types of fats (triglycerides and LDL cholesterol). It is given to lower triglycerides and 
increase the good cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) in patients whose bad cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) 
is already controlled with simvastatin alone in a dose of 20 mg.
You must continue a low fat diet or other measures (e.g. exercise, weight reduction) during treatment 
with Cholib.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are under 18 years of age</p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding
Do not take Cholib if any of the above applies to you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
not sure.
Warnings and precautions:
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cholib if:</p>
<p>you have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)</p>
<p>you are due to have an operation. You may need to stop taking Cholib for a short time.</p>
<p>you drink large amounts of alcohol (more than 21 units (210 mL) a week of pure alcohol)</p>
<p>you have chest pain and are feeling breathless. These may be signs of a blood clot in the lung 
(pulmonary embolism)</p>
<p>you have severe lung disease</p>
<p>you have kidney disease</p>
<p>you or a close family member have a muscle problem which runs in the family</p>
<p>you are taking or, in the last 7 days, have taken or been given a medicine called fusidic acid 
(a medicine for bacterial infection) </p>
<p>you are taking hepatitis C antiviral agents such as elbasvir or grazoprevir (used to treat hepatitis 
C virus infection)</p>
<p>you have or have had myasthenia (a disease with general muscle weakness including in some 
cases muscles used when breathing), or ocular myasthenia (a disease causing eye muscle 
weakness) as statins may sometimes aggravate the condition or lead to the occurrence of 
myasthenia (see section 4).
If any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cholib. Check with 
your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have a muscle weakness that is constant. Additional tests 
and medicines may be needed to diagnose and treat this.
Your doctor should do a blood test before you start taking Cholib. This is to check how well your liver 
is working.
Your doctor may also want you to have blood tests to check how well your liver is working after you 
start taking Cholib.
While you are on this medicine your doctor will monitor you closely if you have diabetes or are at risk 
of developing diabetes. You are likely to be at risk of developing diabetes if you have high levels of 
sugars and fats in your blood, are overweight and have high blood pressure.
Your doctor may do a blood test to check your muscles before and after starting treatment.
Children and adolescents
Cholib must not be given to children and adolescents (age below 18 years).

Do not take Cholib if any of the above applies to you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
not sure.
In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines 
(taking Cholib with any of these medicines can increase the risk of muscle problems):</p>
<p>high doses of at least 1 gram per day of niacin (nicotinic acid) or a treatment containing niacin 
(medicine for lowering fat levels in the blood)</p>
<p>colchicine (a medicine used to treat gout)
Do not take fusidic acid (a medicine for bacterial infections) while using this medicine.
As well as the medicines listed previously, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have 
recently taken or might take any of the following medicines:</p>
<p>anticoagulants such as warfarin, fluindione, phenprocoumone or acenocoumarol 
(medicines to prevent blood clots)</p>

your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Cholib with food and drink
Grapefruit juice contains one or more components that alter how the body uses Cholib. Do not 
consume grapefruit juice with Cholib as it may increase your risk of muscle problems.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>Do not take Cholib if you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or think you may be pregnant. 
If you get pregnant while taking Cholib, stop taking it immediately and contact your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not take Cholib if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed your baby, because it is not 
known if the medicine passes into breast milk.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Cholib is not expected to affect you being able to drive or use tools or machines. However, it should 
be taken into account that some people get dizzy after taking Cholib.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Cholib
Cholib contains types of sugars called lactose and sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that 
you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.
Cholib contains soya lecithin. If you are allergic to peanut, soya or arachis oil do not use Cholib.

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, Cholib can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p>
<p>Unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness may be sign of muscle break down. 
Therefore please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. This is 
because on rare occasions, there have been cases of serious muscle problems including muscle 
breakdown resulting in kidney damage; and very rare deaths have occurred. Compared to a 
fibrate or a statin alone, the risk of muscle breakdown is increased when you take 
these 2 medicines together, as in Cholib. It is higher in female patients or in patients 65 years or 
older.
Some patients have experienced the following serious side effects whilst taking fenofibrate or 
simvastatin (both active substances in Cholib):</p>
<p>hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions including swelling of the face, tongue and throat which may 
cause difficulty in breathing (angioedema) (rare)</p>
<p>a serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty in breathing or dizziness (anaphylaxis) (very 
rare)</p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reaction to Cholib with symptoms like: pain or inflammation of the joints, 
inflammation of blood vessels, unusual bruising, skin eruptions and swelling, hives, skin 
sensitivity to the sun, fever, flushing, shortness of breath and feeling unwell, lupus-like disease 
picture (including rash, joint disorders, and effects on white blood cells)</p>
<p>cramps or painful, tender or weak muscles, muscle rupture - these may be signs of muscle 
inflammation or breakdown, which can cause kidney damage or even death</p>
<p>stomach pain - this may be a sign that your pancreas is inflamed (pancreatitis)</p>
<p>chest pain and feeling breathless - these may be signs of a blood clot in the lung 
(pulmonary embolism)</p>
<p>pain, redness or swelling in the legs - these may be signs of a blood clot in the leg 
(deep vein thrombosis)</p>
<p>yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), or an increase in liver enzymes - these 
may be signs of an inflamed liver (hepatitis and hepatic failure)</p>
<p>increased sensitivity of your skin to sunlight, sun lamps and sunbeds</p>
<p>rash that may occur on the skin or sores in the mouth (lichenoid drug eruptions)
If any of the previously listed serious side effects happen, stop taking Cholib and tell your doctor 
immediately or go to the emergency room at your nearest hospital - you may need urgent medical 
treatment.
Some patients have experienced the following side effects whilst taking Cholib, fenofibrate 
or simvastatin:
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):</p>
<p>Increase in the blood level of  creatinine  (substance excreted by the kidneys)</p>
<p>Increase in blood levels of  homocysteine  (too much of this amino acid in the blood is related 
to a higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, although a 
causal link has not been established)
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):</p>
<p>increase in blood platelets count</p>
<p>elevations in blood tests of liver function (transaminases)</p>
<p>digestive disturbances (stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and flatulence)</p>
<p>infection of the upper respiratory tract
Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):</p>
<p>muscle problems</p>
<p>gallstones</p>
<p>rashes, itching, red patches on the skin</p>
<p>headache</p>
<p>sexual difficulties
Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):</p>
<p>low red blood cell count (anaemia)</p>
<p>numbness or weakness of the arms and legs</p>
<p>confusion</p>
<p>feeling dizzy</p>
<p>feeling exhausted (astenia)</p>
<p>increase in  urea  - produced by the kidneys - shown in tests</p>
<p>increase in  gamma-glutamyltransferase  - produced by the liver - shown in tests</p>
<p>increase in  alkaline phosphatase  - produced by the bile system - shown in tests</p>

The following side effects have also been reported but the frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available information (frequency not known):</p>
<p>severe allergic skin rash with blisters</p>
<p>complications of gall stones such as colic because of stones in bile duct, infection of the bile
