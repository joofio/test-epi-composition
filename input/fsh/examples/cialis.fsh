ability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity. </p>
<p>CIALIS contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation CIALIS works by helping the blood 
vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. CIALIS will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction.  </p>
<p>It is important to note that CIALIS does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your 
partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for

<li>
<p>are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group 
of medicines ( nitrates ) used in the treatment of angina pectoris ( chest pain ). CIALIS has

pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high blood

shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine.  If you are taking riociguat or are 
unsure tell your doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking CIALIS. </p>
<p>Be aware that sexual activity carries a possible risk to patients with heart disease because it puts an extra 
strain on your heart. If you have a heart problem you should tell your doctor.  </p>
<p>Before taking the tablets, tell your doctor if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>sickle cell anaemia (an abnormality of red blood cells). </li>
<li>multiple myeloma (cancer of the bone marrow). </li>
<li>leukaemia (cancer of the blood cells). </li>
<li>any deformation of your penis. </li>
<li>a serious liver problem. </li>
<li>a severe kidney problem. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is not known if CIALIS is effective in patients who have had:</p>
<ul>
<li>pelvic surgery. </li>
<li>removal of all or part of the prostate gland in which nerves of the prostate are cut (radical non-
nerve-sparing prostatectomy). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision or your vision is distorted, dimmed while you are 
taking CIALIS, stop taking CIALIS and contact your doctor immediately.  </p>
<p>Decreased or sudden hearing loss has been noted in some patients taking tadalafil. Although it is not 
known if the event is directly related to tadalafil, if you experience decreased or sudden hearing loss, 
stop taking CIALIS and contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>CIALIS is not intended for use by women.   </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
CIALIS is not intended for use by children and adolescents under the age of 18. Other medicines and CIALIS 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines </p>
<p>Do not take CIALIS if you are already taking nitrates.  </p>
<p>Some medicines may be affected by CIALIS or they may affect how well CIALIS will work. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>an alpha blocker (used to treat high blood pressure or urinary symptoms associated with benign 
prostatic hyperplasia). </li>
<li>other medicines to treat high blood pressure. </li>
<li>riociguat. </li>
<li>a 5- alpha reductase inhibitor (used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia). </li>
<li>medicines such as ketoconazole tablets (to treat fungal infections) and protease inhibitors for 
treatment of AIDS or HIV infection. </li>
<li>
<p>phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine (anticonvulsant medicines). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rifampicin, erythromycin , clarithromycin or itraconazole. </p>
</li>
<li>other treatments for erectile dysfunction. </li>
</ul>
<p>CIALIS with drink and alcohol 
Information on the effect of alcohol is in section 3. Grapefruit juice may affect how well CIALIS will 
work and should be taken with caution. Talk to your doctor for further information. </p>
<p>Fertility 
When dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes.  A reduction in sperm 
was seen in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some men taking CIALIS in clinical studies have reported dizziness. Check carefully how you react to 
the tablets before driving or using machines. </p>
<p>CIALIS contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>CIALIS contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>CIALIS tablets are for oral use in men only. Swallow the tablet whole with some water. The tablets

<p>The recommended dose is one 5 mg tablet taken once a day at approximately the same time of the

times per week. </p>
<p>When taken once a day CIALIS allows you to obtain an erection, when sexually stimulated, at any time 
point during the 24 hours of the day.<br />
It is important to note that CIALIS does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner 
will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for erectile

<p>Drinking alcohol may affect your ability to get an erection and may temporarily lower your blood 
pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take CIALIS, avoid excessive drinking (blood alcohol 
level of 0.08 % or greater), since this may increase the risk of dizziness when standing up. </p>
<p>If you take more CIALIS than you should<br />
Contact your doctor. You may experience side effects described in section 4. If you forget to take CIALIS
