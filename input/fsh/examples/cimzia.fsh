  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Cimzia contains the active substance certolizumab pegol, a human antibody fragment. Antibodies are 
proteins that specifically recognise and bind to other proteins. Cimzia binds to a specific protein called 
tumour necrosis factor   (TNF ). Thereby this TNF  is blocked by Cimzia and this decreases 
inflammation diseases such as in rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and 
psoriasis. Medicines that bind to TNF  are also called TNF blockers. </p>
<p>Cimzia is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases:<br />
* rheumatoid arthritis, 
* axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis), 
* psoriatic arthritis 
* plaque psoriasis </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis 
Cimzia is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the 
joints. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other 
medicines usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be 
given Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. If your doctor 
determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. </p>
<p>Cimzia in combination with methotrexate can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive 
rheumatoid arthritis without previous use of methotrexate or other medicines. </p>
<p>Cimzia, which you will take in combination with methotrexate, is used to: 
* reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, 
* slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease, 
* improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis 
Cimzia is used to treat severe active ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis (sometimes referred to as non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis). These diseases are inflammatory diseases of the spine. If you have ankylosing 
spondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you 
do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cimzia to: 
* reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, 
* improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis 
Cimzia is used to treat active psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the 
joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given 
other medicines, usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will 
be given Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to: 
* reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, 
* improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. 
If your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis 
Cimzia is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory 
disease of the skin, and can also affect your scalp and nails.<br />
Cimzia is used to reduce skin inflammation and other signs and symptoms of your disease.  </p>         </div>"""

- If you are ALLERGIC (hypersensitive) to certolizumab pegol or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6) 
- If you have a severe infection, including active TUBERCULOSIS (TB). 
- If you have moderate to severe HEART FAILURE. Tell your doctor if you have had or have a 
serious heart condition. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Tell your doctor before treatment with Cimzia if any of the following applies to you: </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
- If you experience ALLERGIC REACTIONS such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash, stop using Cimzia and contact your doctor IMMEDIATELY. Some of these 
reactions could occur after the first administration of Cimzia. 
-<br />
If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. </p>
<p>Infections 
- If you have had RECURRENT or OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS or other conditions that 
increase the risk of infections (such as treatment with immunosuppressants, which are 
medicines that could reduce your ability to fight infections). 
- If you have an infection or if you develop symptoms such as fever, wounds, tiredness or dental 
problems. You might get an infection more easily while you are being treated with Cimzia, 
including serious, or in rare cases, life-threatening infections. 
- TUBERCULOSIS (TB) cases have been reported in patients treated with Cimzia, your doctor 
will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Cimzia. This will include 
a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests 
should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. If latent (inactive) tuberculosis is diagnosed, 
you might be required to receive appropriate anti-tuberculosis medicines before starting Cimzia. 
In rare occasions tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventive 
treatment for tuberculosis. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had 
tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If 
symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other 
infection appear during or after therapy with Cimzia tell your doctor immediately. 
- If you are at risk of or are a carrier of or have active HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection, 
Cimzia may increase the risk of reactivation in people who carry this virus. If this occurs, you 
should stop using Cimzia. Your doctor should test you for HBV before starting Cimzia. </p>
<p>Heart failure 
- If you have mild HEART FAILURE and you are being treated with Cimzia, your heart failure 
status must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have 
had or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart 
failure (e.g. shortness of breath or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor 
immediately. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. </p>
<p>Cancer 
- It is uncommon, but cases of certain types of CANCER have been reported in patients treated 
with Cimzia or other TNF blockers. People with more severe rheumatoid arthritis that have had 
the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that 
affects the lymph system, called lymphoma. If you take Cimzia, your risk of getting lymphoma 
or other cancers may increase. In addition, uncommon cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have 
been observed in patients taking Cimzia. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy with 
Cimzia or existing skin lesions change appearance, tell your doctor.<br />
- There have been cases of cancers, including unusual types, in children and teenage patients 
taking TNF-blocking agents, which sometimes resulted in death (see further down  Children 
and adolescents ). </p>
<p>Other disorders 
- Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who are heavy smokers, may 
be at increased risk for cancer with Cimzia treatment. If you have COPD or are a heavy smoker, 
you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for 
you. 
- If you have a nervous system disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide 
whether you should use Cimzia. 
- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body 
fight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, 
bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor immediately. Your doctor may 
decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. 
- It is uncommon, but symptoms of a disease called lupus (for example persistent rash, fever, joint 
pain and tiredness) may occur. If you experience these symptoms, contact your doctor. Your 
doctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. </p>
<p>Vaccinations 
- Talk to your doctor if you have had, or are due to have a vaccine. You should not receive certain 
(live) vaccines while using Cimzia. 
- Certain vaccinations may cause infections. If you received Cimzia while you were pregnant, 
your baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five 
months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your 
baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Cimza use so they can decide 
when your baby should receive any vaccine. </p>
<p>Operations or dental procedures 
- Talk to your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. Tell your 
surgeon or dentist performing the procedure that you are having treatment with Cimzia by 
showing them your Patient Reminder Card. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Cimzia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cimzia 
You should NOT take Cimzia if you are using the following medicines used to treat rheumatoid 
arthritis:</p>
<ul>
<li>anakinra  </li>
<li>abatacept 
If you have questions, please ask your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cimzia can be taken together with:</p>
<ul>
<li>methotrexate,  </li>
<li>corticosteroids, or  </li>
<li>pain medicines including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (also called NSAIDs). </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>There is limited experience with Cimzia in pregnant women. 
Cimzia should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. If you are a woman of childbearing 
potential, discuss with your doctor regarding use of adequate contraception while using Cimzia. For 
women planning pregnancy, contraception may be considered for 5 months after the last Cimzia dose. </p>
<p>If you received Cimzia during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals about 
your Cimzia use before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on 
vaccinations). </p>
<p>Cimzia can be used during breastfeeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Cimzia may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness (including 
room spinning sensation, blurred vision and tiredness) may occur after you take Cimzia. </p>

<p>How Cimzia is given 
Cimzia will usually be given to you by a specialist doctor or healthcare professional. You will be 
given Cimzia as either one (200 mg dose) or two injections (400 mg dose) under the skin 
(subcutaneous use, abbreviation: SC). It is usually injected into the thigh or tummy. However, do not 
inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard. </p>
<p>Instructions for self-injecting Cimzia 
After suitable training, your doctor may also allow you to inject Cimzia yourself. Please read the 
instructions at the end of this leaflet on how to inject Cimzia. </p>
<p>If your doctor has allowed you to self-inject, you should follow up with your doctor before you 
continue to self-inject: 
* after 12 weeks if you have rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis or psoriatic arthritis, or<br />
* after 16 weeks if you have plaque psoriasis. 
This is so that the doctor can determine if Cimzia is working for you or if another treatment needs to 
be considered. </p>
<p>If you use more Cimzia than you should 
If your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you accidentally inject Cimzia more frequently than 
prescribed, you should tell your doctor. Always take the Patient Reminder Card and the outer carton 
from the Cimzia package with you, even if it is empty. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Cimzia 
If your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you forget to give yourself an injection, you should 
inject the next dose of Cimzia as soon as you remember. Then, talk to your doctor and inject the 
following doses as instructed. </p>
<p>If you stop using Cimzia 
Do not stop using Cimzia without talking to your doctor first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
