C1-esterase inhibitor is a naturally occurring protein that is normally present in the blood. If you have 
a low amount of C1-esterase inhibitor in your blood or your C1-esterase inhibitor is not working 
properly, this can lead to swelling attacks (called angioedema). Symptoms may include stomach pains 
and swelling of the:</p>
<p>hands and feet</p>
<p>face, eyelids, lips or tongue</p>
<p>voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult</p>
<p>genitals
In adults and children, Cinryze can raise the amount of C1-esterase inhibitor in the blood and either 
prevent (prior to undergoing medical or dental procedures) these swelling attacks from occurring or 
stop swelling attacks once they have begun.
In adults, adolescents and children (aged 6 years and above), Cinryze can raise the amount of C1-
esterase inhibitor in the blood and routinely prevent swelling attacks from occurring.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to Human C1-esterase inhibitor or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). It is important to tell your doctor if you think you have ever had 
an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in Cinryze.
Warnings and precautions</p>
<p>Before you start treatment with Cinryze, it is important that you tell your doctor if you have, or 
have had, problems with your blood clotting (thrombotic events). You will be carefully monitored 
if this is the case.</p>
<p>If you begin to suffer from rashes, tightness of the chest, wheezing, or a fast heart beat once you 
have taken Cinryze, you should tell your doctor immediately (see section 4).</p>
<p>When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to 
prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma 
donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each 
donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also 
include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. 
Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, 
the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any 
unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.</p>
<p>The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and for the non-enveloped 
hepatitis A and parvovirus B19 viruses.</p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend that you consider having vaccinations against hepatitis A and B if 
you regularly or repeatedly receive Human C1-esterase inhibitor products that have been taken 
from human plasma.</p>
<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded by your nurse or doctor.
Children
Cinryze is not for use in children below 6 years of age for routine prevention of angioedema attacks.
Other medicines and Cinryze
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking Cinryze. There is limited information on the safety of Cinryze use 
during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of 
taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Cinryze has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Cinryze contains sodium
This medicine contains 11.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site:
http://www.ema.europa.eu/. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Reconstitution and administration of Cinryze
Reconstitution, product administration and handling of the administration set and needles must be 
done with caution. 
Use either the filter transfer device provided with Cinryze or a commercially available double-ended 
needle. 
Only use a silicone-free syringe (provided in the pack) for administration of the product.
Preparation and handling
Cinryze is intended for intravenous administration (into the vein) after reconstitution with water for 
injections.
Cinryze vial is for single use only.
Reconstitution
For a dose of 500 IU: One powder vial, 1 solvent vial, 1 filter transfer device, 1 disposable 10 ml 
syringe, 1 venipuncture set and 1 protective mat are needed. Store the remaining vial and 
administration equipments for the next dose.
For a dose of 1000 IU: Two powder vials, 2 solvent vials, 2 filter transfer devices, 1 disposable 10 ml 
syringe, 1 venipuncture set and 1 protective mat are needed.
Each product vial should be reconstituted with 5 ml water for injections.
One vial of reconstituted Cinryze corresponds to a dose of 500 IU. Therefore only reconstitute one vial 
of Cinryze for one dose of 500 IU.
Two vials of reconstituted Cinryze correspond to a dose of 1000 IU. Therefore two vials are combined 
for one dose of 1000 IU.
1. Work on the mat provided and wash your hands before performing the following procedures.
2. Aseptic technique should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
3. Ensure the powder vial and the solvent vial are at room temperature (15 C - 25 C).
4. Release the powder vial label by tearing down the perforated strip indicated by the inverted 
triangle.
5. Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials. 
6. Cleanse stoppers with a disinfection swab and allow them to dry prior to use.
7. Remove protective covering from the top of the transfer device package. Do not remove the
device from the package.
8. Note: the transfer device must be attached to the solvent vial before being attached to the 
powder vial, so that the vacuum in the powder vial is not lost. Place the solvent vial on a flat 
surface and insert the blue end of the transfer device into the solvent vial, pushing down until 
the spike penetrates through the centre of the solvent vial stopper and the device snaps in place. 
The transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure.
9. Remove the plastic package from the transfer device and discard it. Take care not to touch the 
exposed end of the transfer device.
10. Place the powder vial on a flat surface. Invert the transfer device and the solvent vial containing 
water for injections and insert the clear end of the transfer device into the powder vial, pushing 
down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and the transfer device snaps into place. 
The transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure of the powder vial. 
The vacuum in the powder vial will draw in the solvent. If there is no vacuum in the vial, do not 
use the product.
11. Gently swirl the powder vial until all powder is dissolved. Do not shake the
powder vial. Make sure all the powder is completely dissolved.
12. Disconnect the solvent vial by turning it anti-clockwise. Do not remove the clear end of the 
transfer device from the powder vial.
One vial of reconstituted Cinryze contains 500 IU of Human C1-esterase inhibitor in 5 ml, 
resulting in a concentration of 100 IU/ml. Proceed to administration process if patients receive a 
dose of 500 IU.
Two vials of Cinryze powder must be reconstituted to make one dose (1000 IU/10 ml). Therefore 
repeat instructions 1 to 12 above using an additional package containing a transfer device to 
reconstitute the second of two powder vials. Do not reuse the transfer device. Once the two vials are 
reconstituted proceed to administration process for a dose of 1000 IU.
Administration process for a dose of 500 IU
1. Aseptic technique should be used during the administration procedure.
2. After reconstitution, the Cinryze solutions are colourless to slightly blue and clear. Do not use 
the product if the solutions are turbid or discoloured.
3. Using a sterile, disposable 10 ml syringe, draw back the plunger to allow approximately 5 ml of 
air into the syringe.
4. Attach the syringe onto the top of the clear end of the transfer device by turning it clockwise.
5. Invert the vial gently and inject air into the solution and then slowly withdraw the reconstituted 
Cinryze solution into the syringe. 
6. Detach the syringe from the vial by turning it anti-clockwise and releasing it from the clear end 
of the transfer device.
7. Inspect the reconstituted Cinryze solution for particulate matter prior to administration; do not 
use if particles are observed.
8. Attach the venipuncture set to the syringe containing Cinryze solution and inject intravenously 
(into the vein) into the patient. Administer 500 IU (reconstituted in 5 ml of water for injections) 
of Cinryze by intravenous injection at a rate of 1 ml per minute over 5 minutes.
Administration process for a dose of 1000 IU
1. Aseptic technique should be used during the administration procedure.
2. After reconstitution, the Cinryze solutions are colourless to slightly blue and clear. Do not use 
the product if the solutions are turbid or discoloured.
3. Using a sterile, disposable 10 ml syringe, draw back the plunger to allow approximately 5 ml of 
air into the syringe.
4. Attach the syringe onto the top of the clear end of the transfer device by turning it clockwise.
5. Invert the vial gently and inject air into the solution and then slowly withdraw the reconstituted 
Cinryze solution into the syringe.
6. Detach the syringe from the vial by turning it anti-clockwise and releasing it from the clear 
end of the transfer device. 
7. Using the same syringe, repeat steps 3 to 6 with a second vial of reconstituted Cinryze to make 
one complete 10 ml dose.
8. Inspect the reconstituted Cinryze solution for particulate matter prior to administration; do not 
use if particles are observed.
9. Attach the venipuncture set to the syringe containing Cinryze solution and inject intravenously 
(into the vein) into the patient. Administer 1000 IU (reconstituted in 10 ml of water for 
injections) of Cinryze by intravenous injection (into the vein) at a rate of 1 ml per minute over 
10 minutes. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.</p>         </div>"""
