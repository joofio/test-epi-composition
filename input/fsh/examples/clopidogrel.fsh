medicinal products. Platelets are very small structures in the blood which clump together during blood 
clotting. By preventing this clumping, antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of blood 
clots forming (a process called thrombosis). </p>
<p>Clopidogrel Teva is taken by adults to prevent blood clots (thrombi) forming in hardened blood 
vessels (arteries), a process known as atherothrombosis, which can lead to atherothrombotic events 
(such as stroke, heart attack, or death).  </p>
<p>You have been prescribed Clopidogrel Teva to help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of these 
severe events because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a condition of hardening of arteries (also known as atherosclerosis), and </li>
<li>You have previously experienced a heart attack, stroke or have a condition known as peripheral 
arterial disease, or </li>
<li>You have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as  unstable angina  or  myocardial 
infarction  (heart attack). For the treatment of this condition your doctor may have placed a stent 
in the blocked or narrowed artery to restore effective blood flow. You may also be given 
acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever 
as well as to prevent blood clotting) by your doctor. </li>
<li>You have experienced symptoms of a stroke which go away within a short period of time (also 
known as transient ischemic attack) or an ischemic stroke mild in severity. You may also be 
given acetylsalicylic acid by your doctor starting within the first 24 hours. </li>
<li>You have an irregular heartbeat, a condition called  atrial fibrillation , and you cannot take 
medicines known as  oral anticoagulants  (vitamin K antagonists) which prevent new clots from 
forming and prevent existing clots from growing. You should have been told that  oral 
anticoagulants  are more effective than acetylsalicylic acid or the combined use of Clopidogrel 
Teva and acetylsalicylic acid for this condition. Your doctor should have prescribed Clopidogrel 
Teva and acetylsalicylic acid if you cannot take  oral anticoagulants  and you do not have a risk 
of major bleeding. </li>

- If you are allergic to clopidogrel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or 
bleeding within the brain. 
- If you suffer from severe liver disease. </p>
<p>If you think any of these apply to you, or if you are in any doubt at all, consult your doctor before 
taking Clopidogrel Teva. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Clopidogrel Teva: 
* if you have a risk of bleeding such as<br />
- a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer). 
- a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, organs 
or joints of your body). 
- a recent serious injury. 
- a recent surgery (including dental). 
- a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days. 
* if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischemic stroke) which occurred within the last 
seven days. 
* if you have kidney or liver disease. 
* if you have had an allergy or reaction to any medicine used to treat your disease. 
* if you had a past medical history of non-traumatic brain hemorrhage. </p>
<p>While you are taking Clopidogrel Teva: 
* You should tell your doctor if a surgery (including dental) is planned. 
* You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition (also known as 
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP) that includes fever and bruising under the skin 
that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, 
yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4  Possible side effects ). 
* If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked to 
the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor cuts and 
injuries, e.g., cutting yourself shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you are 
concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4  Possible 
side effects ). 
* Your doctor may order blood tests. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children because it does not work. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Clopidogrel Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some other medicines may influence the use of Clopidogrel Teva or vice versa.  </p>
<p>You should specifically tell your doctor if you take 
- medicines that may increase your risk of bleeding such as: * 
oral anticoagulants, medicines used to reduce blood clotting, * 
a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, usually used to treat painful and/or 
inflammatory conditions of muscle or joints, 
 * 
heparin or any other injectable medicine used to reduce blood clotting, * 
ticlopidine, or other antiplatelet agents, * 
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (including but not restricted to fluoxetine or 
fluvoxamine), medicines usually used to treat depression, * 
rifampicin (used to treat severe infections), 
- omeprazole or esomeprazole, medicines to treat upset stomach, 
- fluconazole or voriconazole, medicines to treat fungal infections, 
- efavirenz, or other anti-retroviral medicines (used to treat HIV infections), 
- carbamazepine, a medicine to treat some forms of epilepsy, 
- moclobemide, medicine to treat depression, 
- repaglinide, medicine to treat diabetes, 
- paclitaxel, medicine to treat cancer, 
- opioids: while you are treated with clopidogrel, you should inform your doctor before being 
prescribed any opioid (used to treat severe pain), 
- rosuvastatin (used to lower your cholesterol level). </p>
<p>If you have experienced severe chest pain (unstable angina or heart attack), transient ischemic attack 
or ischemic stroke in mild severity, you may be prescribed Clopidogrel Teva in combination with 
acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever. An 
occasional use of acetylsalicylic acid (no more than 1,000 mg in any 24 hour period) should generally 
not cause a problem, but prolonged use in other circumstances should be discussed with your doctor. </p>
