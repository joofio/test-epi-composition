belongs to a group of medicines called antiplatelet medicinal products. Platelets are very small 
structures in the blood which clump together during blood clotting. By preventing this clumping in 
some types of blood vessels (called arteries), antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of 
blood clots forming (a process called atherothrombosis). </p>
<p>Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid Zentiva is taken by adults to prevent blood clots forming in hardened 
arteries which can lead to atherothrombotic events (such as stroke, heart attack, or death).  </p>
<p>You have been prescribed Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid Zentiva in place of the two separate 
medicines, clopidogrel and ASA, to help prevent blood clots because you have experienced a severe 
type of chest pain known as  unstable angina  or heart attack (myocardial infarction). For the treatment 
of this condition your doctor may have placed a stent in the blocked or narrowed artery to restore 
effective blood flow. </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>if you are allergic to other products called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products usually used 
to treat painful and/or inflammatory conditions of muscles or joints. </p>
<p>if you have a medical condition that includes the combination of asthma, nasal discharge (runny 
nose) and polyps (a type of growth in the nose). </p>
<p>if you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or 
bleeding within the brain. </p>
<p>if you suffer from severe liver disease. </p>
<p>if you suffer from severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>if you are in your last trimester of pregnancy.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>If any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking 
Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid Zentiva: </p>
<p>if you have a risk of bleeding such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer). </li>
<li>a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, 
organs or joints of your body). </li>
<li>a recent serious injury. </li>
<li>a recent surgery (including dental). </li>
<li>a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days. </li>
</ul>
<p>if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred in the last 
seven days. </p>
<p>if you have kidney or liver disease. </p>
<p>if you have a history of asthma or allergic reactions including allergy to any medicine used to 
treat your disease.  </p>
<p>if you have gout.  </p>
<p>if you drink alcohol, because of the increased risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal injury. </p>
<p>if you have a condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency 
because of the risk of a particular form of anaemia (low number of red blood cells). </p>
<p>While you are taking Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid Zentiva: </p>
<p>You should tell your doctor 
- if a surgery (including dental) is planned. 
- if you have any stomach or abdominal pain or bleeding in the stomach or bowels (red 
stools or black stools). </p>
<p>You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition known as 
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP that includes fever and bruising under the skin 
that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, 
yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4). </p>
<p>If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked to 
the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor cuts and 
injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you are 
concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4. Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>Your doctor may order blood tests. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Clopidogrel/Acetylsalicylic acid Zentiva is not intended for use in children or adolescents less than 
18 years of age. There is a possible association between acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and Reye s 
Syndrome when products containing ASA are given to children or adolescents with a viral infection. 
Reye s Syndrome is a very rare disease which can be fatal. </p>

medicines.
