<p>Colobreathe is used to control persistent lung infections caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa in adult patients and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa is a very common bacterium that infects nearly all cystic fibrosis patients at some time 
during their lives. Some people will get this infection whilst very young but for others it will be much 
later. If this infection is not properly controlled it will cause damage to the lungs.  </p>
<p>How it works 
Colobreathe works by destroying the bacterial cell membrane, having a lethal effect on them.  </p>         </div>"""

  if you/your child are allergic to colistimethate sodium, colistin sulphate or polymyxins. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Colobreathe. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you/your child has ever had any of the following conditions 
  have reacted badly to inhaled dry powder medicines previously unless this has already been 
discussed with your doctor. 
  already have a muscle condition known as myasthenia gravis or the inherited condition, 
porphyria 
  blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up) </p>
<p>After each inhalation of Colobreathe, the mouth should be rinsed with water. The rinse should not be 
swallowed. Rinsing may reduce the risk of developing oral fungal super-infection during treatment 
and may also reduce the unpleasant taste associated with colistimethate sodium. 
When you/your child start using Colobreathe, you/your child may find they have cough, 
breathlessness, tightness of chest or wheezing. The number of these side-effects may reduce as you 
continue to use the inhaler or your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator to use before or after taking 
Colobreathe. If any of these effects become a problem, please contact your doctor who may change 
your treatment. </p>
<p>If you/your child has any problems with your kidneys or nerves, care should be taken when 
administering Colobreathe but your doctor should be aware of this. </p>
<p>If you/your child needs to have other forms of colistimethate either by injection or nebulisation 
caution should be used but your doctor should be aware of this. </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give Colobreathe to children under the age of 6 years as it is not suitable for them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Colobreathe 
Tell your doctor if you/your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
and in particular: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you/your child are taking aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat infections caution must be 
taken; </li>
<li>if you/your child suffer from myasthenia gravis and are taking macrolide type antibiotics such 
as azithromycin and clarithromycin, or fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin and 
ciprofloxacin. Taking these at the same time as Colobreathe may cause problems with muscle 
weakness; </li>
<li>if you/your child are taking colistimethate by injection or nebulisation caution must be taken; </li>
<li>if you/your child need to have a general anaesthetic caution must be taken. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>There is no information about the safety of Colobreathe in pregnant women. Your doctor should 
advise you before using Colobreathe whether the benefits of the medicine exceed the risks. </p>
<p>Colistimethate sodium may be secreted in the breast milk. Please discuss the use of Colobreathe with 
your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is possible while using Colobreathe that you may experience dizziness, confusion or have problems 
with your sight. Do not drive or use any machines until the symptoms have gone away. </p>
<p>Colobreathe contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>The first dose should be given under medical supervision. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 
Adults and children 6 years of age and older </p>
<p>The contents of one Colobreathe capsule should be inhaled twice a day using the Turbospin 
inhaler. 
  There should be a 12 hour gap between doses. </p>
<p>The order in which other treatments should be taken or carried out 
If you/your child are taking other treatments for cystic fibrosis you/your child should take them in the 
following order: 
* Inhaled bronchodilators 
* Chest physiotherapy<br />
* Other inhaled medicines 
* Then Colobreathe  </p>
<p>You/your child should confirm the order of your treatments with your doctor. </p>
<p>Method of administration </p>
<p>Colobreathe is inhaled into the lungs as a powder from the capsule using the hand-held inhaler called 
the Turbospin. Colobreathe can only be administered using this device. </p>
<p>Do not swallow Colobreathe capsules.  </p>
<p>To inhale Colobreathe from the capsule through the Turbospin inhaler follow the procedure described 
below. Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse should show you/your child how to inhale the medicine when 
you/your child first start treatment: </p>
<p>Taking Colobreathe using the Turbospin inhaler </p>
<p>Preparing the Turbospin </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the cap. It comes away with a gentle pull. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unscrew the mouthpiece, exposing the chamber of the Turbospin inhaler. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove a single capsule from the blister. Once you have removed the capsule it must be used 
immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently insert the capsule into the chamber with the widest end first. No force is required.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now replace the mouthpiece by screwing it back into place. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Piercing the capsule and inhaling the medicine </p>
<ol>
<li>To pierce the capsule: </li>
<li>Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece upright, gently push the piston upwards until the 
visible line is reached   you will feel resistance at this point and this will lock the capsule 
in place ready for piercing. Hold that position before continuing to follow through with 
the piercing. </li>
<li>Now, with the capsule locked in place, continue pushing the piston as far as it will go and 
then release. </li>
<li>The capsule is now pierced and the contents can be inhaled. </li>
<li>
<p>Do not pierce the capsule more than once. You may see a small amount of powder 
released from the capsule chamber after the capsule is pierced, this is normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe out slowly. Place the mouthpiece between your lips and teeth. Ensure there is a seal 
between your lips and the mouthpiece. Take care not to cover the air slits with your fingers or 
mouth during inhalation.  </p>
</li>
<li>Then, breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth at a rate sufficient for you to hear or 
feel the capsule spinning.  </li>
<li>Remove the Turbospin inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or 
for as long as is comfortable, then breathe out slowly. </li>
<li>If you do not hear the capsule spinning, the capsule may be stuck in the compartment. If this 
occurs, you can loosen the capsule by gently tapping the chamber of the inhaler. Do not try to 
loosen the capsule by repeatedly pressing the piston. If the capsule cannot be loosened and the 
powder cannot be inhaled, dispose of the broken capsule and any powder remaining in it and 
use another. </li>
<li>Inhale the medicine again by repeating Steps 7 and 8 to ensure you have emptied the capsule. </li>
<li>You can check whether the capsule is empty by unscrewing the mouthpiece and checking the 
capsule. If it is not empty, repeat steps 7, 8 and 9 until you have inhaled all of the contents.  </li>
<li>Once all the contents have been inhaled, rinse your mouth out well with water and spit out. </li>
</ol>
<p>Removing the empty capsule from the Turbospin </p>
<ol>
<li>When the capsule is empty, unscrew the mouthpiece, then remove and discard the empty 
capsule. </li>
</ol>
<p>Additional information  </p>
<p>As you breathe in slowly, you suck air through the body of the Turbospin inhaler into the capsule 
chamber. The tiny particles of medication in the capsule are picked up by the airflow and carried down 
your airway into your lungs. </p>
<p>Occasionally, very small pieces of the capsule shell can get into your mouth or airways.<br />
<em> If this happens, you may be able to feel these pieces on your tongue or in your airways.<br />
</em> The capsule shell is made of gelatin, which is harmless to humans if swallowed or inhaled. 
* The chances of the capsule breaking into pieces are increased if the capsule is pierced more than 
once during Step 6. Cleaning the Turbospin device </p>
<p>Clean the Turbospin inhaler after each dose using the following procedure: 
1. Deeply press the piston a few times whilst keeping the chamber turned upside down. 
2. Clean the chamber using a tissue or cotton bud. Do not use water. 
3. Screw the mouthpiece firmly back into place, put the cap back on and the inhaler is ready to 
be used for your next dose. </p>
<p>If you/your child use more Colobreathe than you/your child should, or have accidentally 
swallowed the capsule, contact your doctor immediately for advice. </p>
<p>If you/your child forget to use Colobreathe </p>
<p>If you/your child forget to take a dose of Colobreathe then you/your child should take your missed 
dose as soon as you/your child remember. You/your child must not take 2 doses within 12 hours. 
Carry on from there as instructed. </p>
<p>If you/your child stop using Colobreathe </p>
<p>Do not stop your treatment early unless your doctor says you can. Your doctor will decide how long 
you/your child s treatment should last. </p>
<p>If you/your child have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
