<p>Combivir contains two active ingredients that are used to treat HIV infection: lamivudine and 
zidovudine. Both of these belong to a group of antiretroviral medicines called nucleoside analogue 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  </p>
<p>Combivir does not completely cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and 
keeps it at a low level. It also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white 
blood cells that are important in helping your body to fight infection.  </p>

* if you have a very low red blood cell count (anaemia) or a very low white blood cell 
count (neutropenia). 
Check with your doctor if you think any of these apply to you. </p>
<p>Take special care with Combivir<br />
Some people taking Combivir or other combination treatments for HIV are more at risk of serious side 
effects. You need to be aware of the extra risks:<br />
<em> if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B 
infection, do not stop Combivir without your doctor s advice, as your hepatitis may come 
back)<br />
</em> if you have kidney disease<br />
* if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman)<br />
Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you. Your doctor will decide if the active 
substances are suitable for you. You may need extra check-ups, including blood tests, while you 
are taking your medicine. See Section 4 for more information.  </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms<br />
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. You 
need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Combivir. <br />
Read the information  Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV  in 
Section 4 of this leaflet.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Combivir<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or if you have taken any 
recently, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.  </p>
<p>Remember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking 
Combivir.  </p>
<p>These medicines should not be used with Combivir:<br />
<em> other medicinal products containing lamivudine, to treat HIV infection or hepatitis B 
infection<br />
</em> emtricitabine, to treat HIV infection<br />
<em> stavudine, to treat HIV infection<br />
</em> ribavirin or injections of ganciclovir to treat viral infections<br />
<em> high doses of co-trimoxazole, an antibiotic<br />
</em> cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia<br />
Tell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these.  </p>
<p>Some medicines can make it more likely that you ll have side effects, or make side effects worse. 
These include:<br />
<em> sodium valproate, to treat epilepsy<br />
</em> interferon, to treat viral infections<br />
<em> pyrimethamine, to treat malaria and other parasitic infections<br />
</em> dapsone, to prevent pneumonia and treat skin infections<br />
<em> fluconazole or flucytosine, to treat fungal infections such as candida<br />
</em> pentamidine or atovaquone to treat parasitic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia (often referred to as PCP)<br />
<em> amphotericin or co-trimoxazole, to treat fungal and bacterial infections<br />
</em> probenecid, to treat gout and similar conditions, and given with some antibiotics to make 
them more effective<br />
<em> methadone, used as a heroin substitute<br />
</em> vincristine, vinblastine or doxorubicin, to treat cancer.<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these.  </p>
<p>Some medicines interact with Combivir<br />
These include:<br />
<em> clarithromycin, an antibiotic<br />
if you are taking clarithromycin, take your dose at least 2 hours before or after you take your 
Combivir.<br />
</em> phenytoin, for treating epilepsy.<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin. Your doctor may need to monitor you while you 
are taking Combivir.<br />
* medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, 
mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are being treated with any of these. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, if you become pregnant or if you are planning to become pregnant talk to your 
doctor about the risks and benefits to you and your baby of taking Combivir.  </p>
<p>Combivir and similar medicines may cause side effects in unborn babies. If you have taken Combivir 
during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to 
monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the 
benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. <br />
A small amount of the ingredients in Combivir can also pass into your breast-milk. 
If you re breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Combivir can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert.<br />
Do not drive or operate machines unless you are feeling well.  </p>

<p>Stay in regular contact with your doctor 
Combivir helps to control your condition. You need to keep taking it every day to stop your illness 
getting worse. You may still develop other infections and illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
Keep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Combivir without your doctor s 
advice.

<p>Adults and adolescents 30 kg or more 
The usual dose of Combivir is one tablet twice a day. 
Take the tablets at regular times, leaving approximately 12 hours between each tablet. </p>
<p>Children who weigh between 21 and 30 kg 
The usual starting dose of Combivir is one half tablet ( ) taken in the morning and one whole tablet 
taken in the evening. </p>

is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.<br />
Treatment with Combivir often causes a loss of fat from legs, arms and face (lipoatrophy). This loss of 
body fat has been shown to be not fully reversible after discontinuation of zidovudine. Your doctor 
should monitor for signs of lipoatrophy. Tell your doctor if you notice any loss of fat from your legs, 
arms, and face. When these signs occur, Combivir should be stopped and your HIV treatment 
changed. </p>
<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them. </p>
<p>When you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of 
Combivir or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV disease itself. So it is very 
important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. </p>
<p>As well as the side effects listed below for Combivir, other conditions can develop during 
combination therapy for HIV.<br />
It is important to read the information later in this section under  Other possible side effects of

<p>If you get side effects 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects get severe or troublesome, or if you 
notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV 
Combination therapy such as Combivir may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment. </p>
<p>Old infections may flare up 
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When these people start treatment, they may find 
that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. These symptoms are 
probably caused by the body s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these 
infections. </p>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection while you are taking Combivir: 
Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your 
doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect 
Some people taking Combivir develop a condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged 
liver. </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the body. It is rare; if it happens, it usually 
develops after a few months of treatment. It can be life-threatening, causing failure of internal organs. 
Lactic acidosis is more likely to develop in people who have liver disease, or in obese (very 
overweight) people, especially women. </p>
<p>Signs of lactic acidosis include: 
* deep, rapid, difficult breathing 
* drowsiness 
* numbness or weakness in the limbs 
* feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) 
* stomach pain. </p>
<p>During your treatment, your doctor will monitor you for signs of lactic acidosis. If you have any of the 
symptoms listed above, or any other symptoms that worry you: 
See your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>You may have problems with your bones 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
* if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
* if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
* if they drink alcohol 
* if their immune systems are very weak 
* if they are overweight. </p>
<p>Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
* stiffness in the joints 
* aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
* difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Other effects may show up in blood tests 
Combination therapy for HIV can also cause: 
* increased levels of lactic acid in the blood, which on rare occasions can lead to lactic 
acidosis </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
