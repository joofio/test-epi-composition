COMETRIQ is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance cabozantinib (S)-malate.<br />
It is a medicine used to treat medullary thyroid cancer, a rare type of thyroid cancer, that cannot be removed 
by surgery or that has spread to other parts of the body.  </p>
<p>How COMETRIQ works 
COMETRIQ blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are involved in the 
growth of cells and the development of new blood vessels that supply them. These proteins can be present in 
high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action COMETRIQ can slow down the rate at which the 
tumour grows and help to cut off the blood supply that the cancer needs. 
COMETRIQ may slow or stop the growth of medullary thyroid cancer. It may help shrink tumours 
associated with this type of cancer. </p>         </div>"""

</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these affect you. You may need treatment for them, or your doctor may decide to 
change your dose of COMETRIQ, or stop treatment altogether. See also section 4  Possible side effects . </p>
<p>You should also tell your dentist that you are taking COMETRIQ. It is important for you to practice good 
mouth care during treatment with COMETRIQ. </p>

<p>COMETRIQ is not recommended for children or adolescents. The effects of COMETRIQ in people younger 
than 18 years old are not known. </p>
<p>Other medicines and COMETRIQ </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because COMETRIQ can affect the way some other 
medicines work. Also, some medicines can affect the way COMETRIQ works. This could mean that your 
doctor needs to change the dose(s) that you take.  </p>

<p>Oral contraceptives 
If you take COMETRIQ whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may be ineffective. You 
should also use a barrier contraceptive (e.g. condom or diaphragm) whilst taking COMETRIQ and for at 
least 4 months after treatment has finished. </p>
<p>Taking COMETRIQ with food </p>
<p>Avoid consuming grapefruit-containing products for as long as you are using this medicine, as it may 
increase the levels of COMETRIQ in your blood. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility  </p>
<p>Avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with COMETRIQ. If you or your partner could become 
pregnant, use adequate contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after treatment has finished. 
Talk to your doctor about which methods of contraception are appropriate while you are taking COMETRIQ. 
See section 2. Tell your doctor if you or your partner become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while you are being 
treated with COMETRIQ.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor BEFORE taking COMETRIQ if you or your partner are considering or planning to 
have a baby after your treatment has finished.  There is a possibility your fertility could be affected by 
treatment with COMETRIQ.  </p>
<p>Women taking COMETRIQ should not breast feed during treatment and for at least 4 months after treatment 
has finished, as cabozantinib and/or its metabolites may be excreted in breast milk and be harmful to your 
child. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Use caution when driving or using machines. Keep in mind that treatment with COMETRIQ may make you 
feel tired or weak. </p>
