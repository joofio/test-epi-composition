<p>The vaccine causes the immune system (the body s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood 
cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.   </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: 
* you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past. 
* you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle 
injection. 
* you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination 
if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. 
* you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots. 
* you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine 
such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. </p>
<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These 
conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 
14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger 
males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared 
with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required 
intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to 
signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek 
immediate medical attention should these occur.  </p>
<p>As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how 
long you will be protected. </p>
<p>The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are 
immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, you should 
continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts 
should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Children 
Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for 
children aged under 12 years. </p>
<p>There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 
12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations. </p>
<p>The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Comirnaty 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. </p>
<p>Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women 
vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on 
the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby 
after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been 
seen.  </p>
<p>Comirnaty can be given during breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or 
use machines. </p>
<p>Comirnaty contains potassium and sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 potassium-free . </p>
<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu.  </p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Administer Comirnaty intramuscularly after dilution as a single dose of 0.3 mL regardless of prior 
COVID-19 vaccination status.  </p>
<p>For individuals who have previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty should be 
administered at least 3 months after the most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.<br />
Additional doses may be given to individuals who are severely immunocompromised. </p>
<p>Traceability<br />
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  </p>
<p>Handling instructions prior to use 
Comirnaty should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the 
sterility of the prepared dispersion. 
* Verify that the vial has a purple plastic cap and the product name is Comirnaty 
30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection (12 years and older).<br />
<em> If the vial has another product name on the label, please make reference to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics for that formulation. 
* The vial is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to dilution. Frozen vials should be transferred 
to an environment of 2  C to 8  C to thaw; a 195-vial pack may take 3 hours to thaw. 
Alternatively, frozen vials may also be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30  C for 
immediate use. 
* The unopened vial can be stored for up to 1 month at 2  C to 8  C; not exceeding the printed 
expiry date (EXP). Within the 1-month shelf life at 2  C to 8  C, up to 48 hours may be used for 
transportation.<br />
</em> Allow the thawed vial to come to room temperature. Prior to use, the unopened vial can be 
stored for up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 30  C. Thawed vials can be handled in room light 
conditions. </p>
<p>Dilution 
* Gently invert the vial 10 times prior to dilution. Do not shake. 
* Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous 
particles.<br />
<em> The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.8 mL of sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic 
techniques.<br />
</em> Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial stopper by withdrawing 1.8 mL 
air into the empty diluent syringe. 
* Gently invert the diluted dispersion 10 times. Do not shake. 
* The diluted vaccine should present as an off-white dispersion with no particulates visible. Do 
not use the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present. 
* The diluted vials should be marked with the appropriate discard date and time. 
* After dilution, store at 2  C to 30  C and use within 6 hours, including any transportation time.<br />
* Do not freeze or shake the diluted dispersion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted dispersion to 
come to room temperature prior to use. </p>
<p>Preparation of 0.3 mL doses 
* After dilution, the vial contains 2.25 mL from which 6 doses of 0.3 mL can be extracted.<br />
<em> Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 
* Withdraw 0.3 mL of Comirnaty.<br />
Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 6 doses from a 
single vial. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of 
no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. 
* Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. 
* If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the 
vial and any excess volume.<br />
</em> Discard any unused vaccine within 6 hours after dilution. </p>
<p>Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.  </p>
