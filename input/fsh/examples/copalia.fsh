to control high blood pressure. </p>
<p>Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called  calcium channel blockers . Amlodipine 
stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from 
tightening. </p>
<p>Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called  angiotensin-II receptor antagonists . 
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the 
blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. 
This means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. As a result, the 
blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. </p>
<p>Copalia is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not controlled enough 
with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own. </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers. This may involve 
itching, reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing. </p>
<p>if you are allergic to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Copalia. </p>
<p>if you have severe liver problems or bile problems such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. </p>
<p>if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Copalia in early pregnancy, 
see Pregnancy section). </p>
<p>if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension). </p>
<p>if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition 
where your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). </p>
<p>if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack. </p>
<p>if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren. 
If any of the above applies to you, do not take Copalia and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Copalia: </p>
<p>if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea). </p>
<p>if you have liver or kidney problems. </p>
<p>if you have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have a narrowing of your 
kidney arteries. </p>
<p>if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called  primary hyperaldosteronism . </p>
<p>if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor s 
instructions for the starting dose carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function. </p>
<p>if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called  aortic 
or mitral stenosis ) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
 obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ). </p>
<p>if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other 
medicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, 
stop taking Copalia and contact your doctor straight away. You should never take Copalia 
again. </p>
<p>if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: </p>
<p>an ACE inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. </p>
<p>aliskiren. </p>
<p>Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading  Do not take Copalia . </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Copalia. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of Copalia in children and adolescents is not recommended (aged below 18 years old). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Copalia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. In some cases 
you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed 
below: </p>
<p>ACE inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take Copalia  and 
 Warnings and precautions ); </p>
<p>diuretics (a type of medicine also called  water tablets  which increases the amount of urine you 
produce); </p>
<p>lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression); </p>
<p>potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and 
other substances that may increase potassium levels; </p>
<p>certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or 
selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors). Your doctor may also check your 
kidney function; </p>
<p>anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone); </p>
<p>St. John s wort; </p>
<p>nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called  vasodilators ; </p>
<p>medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir); </p>
<p>medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); </p>
<p>medicines used to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, 
telithromycin); </p>
<p>verapamil, diltiazem (heart medicines); </p>
<p>simvastatin (a medicine used to control high cholesterol levels); </p>
<p>dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities); </p>
<p>medicines used to protect against transplant rejection (ciclosporin). </p>
<p>Copalia with food and drink 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking Copalia. This is 
because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active 
substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect 
of Copalia. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Copalia before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Copalia. Copalia is not recommended 
in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Amlodipine has been shown 
to pass into breast milk in small amounts. Copalia is not recommended for mothers who are breast-
feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if 
your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine may make you feel dizzy. This can affect how well you can concentrate. So, if you are 
not sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you 
need to concentrate on. </p>         </div>"""

doctor immediately. Excess fluid may accumulate in your lungs (pulmonary oedema) causing 
shortness of breath that may develop up to 24-48 hours after intake. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Copalia 
If you forget to take this medicine, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at its 
usual time. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Copalia 
Stopping your treatment with Copalia may cause your disease to get worse. Do not stop taking your 
medicine unless your doctor tells you to. </p>         </div>"""
