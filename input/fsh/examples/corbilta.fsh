have a tumour of the adrenal gland
-
are taking certain medicines for treating depression (combinations of selective MAO-A and

have ever had neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS   this is a rare reaction to medicines used 
to treat severe mental disorders)
-
have ever had non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis (a rare muscle disorder)
-
have a severe liver disease.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Corbilta if you have or have ever had:
-
a heart attack or any other diseases of the heart including cardiac arrhythmias, or of the blood 
vessels
-
asthma or any other disease of the lungs
-
a liver problem, because your dose may need to be adjusted
-
kidney or hormone-related diseases
-
stomach ulcers or convulsions
-
if you experience prolonged diarrhoea consult your doctor as it may be a sign of inflammation 
of the colon
-
any form of severe mental disorder like psychosis
-
chronic wide-angle glaucoma, because your dose may need to be adjusted and the pressure in 
your eyes may need to be monitored.
Consult your doctor if you are currently taking:
-
antipsychotics (medicines used to treat psychosis)
-
a medicine which may cause low blood pressure when rising from a chair or bed. You should 
be aware that Corbilta may make these reactions worse.
Consult your doctor if during the treatment with Corbilta you:
-
notice that your muscles get very rigid or jerk violently, or if you get tremors, agitation, 
confusion, fever, rapid pulse, or wide fluctuations in your blood pressure. If any of this 
happens, contact your doctor immediately.
-
feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts, or notice unusual changes in your behaviour
-
find yourself suddenly falling asleep, or if you feel very drowsy. If this happens, you should not 
drive or use any tools or machines (see also section  Driving and using machines ).
-
notice that uncontrolled movements begin or get worse after you started to take Corbilta. If this 
happens, your doctor may need to change the dose of your antiparkinson medicine.
-
experience diarrhoea: monitoring of your weight is recommended in order to avoid potentially 
excessive weight loss
-
experience progressive anorexia, asthenia (weakness, exhaustion) and weight decrease within a 
relatively short period of time. If this happens, a general medical evaluation including liver 
function should be considered.
-
feel the need to stop using Corbilta, see section  If you stop taking Corbilta .
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing addiction-like symptoms 
leading to craving for large doses of Corbilta and other medicines used to treat Parkinson s disease.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in 
ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain 
activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders 
and can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a 
preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your 
treatments.
Your doctor may take some regular laboratory tests during a long term treatment with Corbilta.
If you must undergo surgery, please tell your doctor that you are using Corbilta.
Corbilta is not recommended to be used for treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. involuntary 
movements, shaking, muscle rigidity and muscle contractions) caused by other medicines.
Children and adolescents
Experience with Corbilta in patients under 18 years is limited. Therefore, the use of Corbilta in 
children or adolescents is not recommended.
Other medicines and Corbilta
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Do not take Corbilta if you are taking certain medicines for treating depression (combinations of 
selective MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors, or non-selective MAO inhibitors).
Corbilta may increase the effects and side effects of certain medicines. These include:
-
medicines used to treat depression such as moclobemide, amitriptyline, desipramine, 
maprotiline, venlafaxine and paroxetine
-
rimiterole and isoprenaline, used to treat respiratory diseases
-
adrenaline, used for severe allergic reactions
-
noradrenaline, dopamine and dobutamine, used to treat heart diseases and low blood pressure
-
alpha-methyldopa, used to treat high blood pressure
-
apomorphine, which is used to treat Parkinson s disease.
The effects of Corbilta may be weakened by certain medicines. These include:
-
dopamine antagonists used to treat mental disorders, nausea and vomiting
-
phenytoin, used to prevent convulsions
-
papaverine used to relax the muscles.
Corbilta may make it harder for you to digest iron. Therefore, do not take Corbilta and iron 
supplements at the same time. After taking one of them, wait at least 2 to 3 hours before taking the 
other.
Corbilta with food and drink
Corbilta may be taken with or without food. For some patients, Corbilta may not be well absorbed if it 
is taken with, or shortly after eating protein-rich food (such as meats, fish, dairy products, seeds and 
nuts). Consult your doctor if you think this applies to you.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Corbilta.
Driving and using machines
Corbilta may lower your blood pressure, which may make you feel light-headed or dizzy. Therefore, 
be particularly careful when you drive or when you use any tools or machines.
If you feel very drowsy, or if you sometimes find yourself suddenly falling asleep, wait until you feel 
fully awake again before driving or doing anything else that requires you to be alert. Otherwise, you 
may put yourself and others at risk of serious injury or death.
Corbilta contains sucrose
Corbilta contains sucrose (1.2 mg/tablet). If you have been told by your doctor that you have 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per maximum recommended daily dose, that 
is to say essentially  sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

For adults and elderly:
-
Your doctor will tell you exactly how many tablets of Corbilta to take each day.
-
The tablets are not intended to be split or broken into smaller pieces.
-
You should take only one tablet each time.
-
Depending on how you respond to treatment, your doctor may suggest a higher or lower dose.
-
If you are taking Corbilta 50 mg/12.5 mg/200 mg, 75 mg/18.75 mg/200 mg, 
100 mg/25 mg/200 mg, 125 mg/31.25 mg/200 mg or 150 mg/37.5 mg/200 mg tablets, do not 
take more than 10 tablets per day.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you think the effect of Corbilta is too strong or too weak, or if 
you experience possible side effects.
To open the bottle for the first time: open the closure, 
and then press with your thumb on the seal until it 
breaks. See picture 1. Picture 1
If you take more Corbilta than you should
If you have accidentally taken more Corbilta tablets than you should, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
immediately. In case of an overdose you may feel confused or agitated, your heart rate may be slower 
or faster than normal or the colour of your skin, tongue, eyes or urine may change.
If you forget to take Corbilta
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.
If it is more than 1 hour until your next dose:
Take one tablet as soon as you remember, and the next tablet at the normal time.
If it is less than 1 hour until your next dose:
Take a tablet as soon as you remember, wait 1 hour, then take another tablet. After that carry on as 
normal.
Always leave at least an hour between Corbilta tablets, to avoid possible side effects.
If you stop taking Corbilta
Do not stop taking Corbilta unless your doctor tells you to. In such a case your doctor may need to 
adjust your other antiparkinson medicines, especially levodopa, to give sufficient control of your 
symptoms. If you suddenly stop taking Corbilta and other antiparkinsonian medicines it may result in 
unwanted side effects.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
