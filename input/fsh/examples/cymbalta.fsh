<p>Cymbalta is used in adults to treat:

* diabetic neuropathic pain (often described as burning, stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or 
like an electric shock. There may be loss of feeling in the affected area, or sensations such as 
touch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain) </p>
<p>Cymbalta starts to work in most people with depression or anxiety within two weeks of starting 
treatment, but it may take 2-4 weeks before you feel better. Tell your doctor if you do not start to feel 
better after this time. Your doctor may continue to give you Cymbalta when you are feeling better to 
prevent your depression or anxiety from returning </p>
<p>In people with diabetic neuropathic pain it can take some weeks before you feel better. Talk to your 
doctor if you do not feel better after 2 months. </p>         </div>"""

<p>are allergic to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of  this medicine (listed in section 6) </p>
<p>have liver disease </p>
<p>have severe kidney disease </p>
<p>are taking or have taken within the last 14 days, another medicine known as a monoamine

<p>are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacin 
which are used to treat some infections </p>
<p>are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see  Other medicines and Cymbalta )  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. Your doctor will tell you if you 
should be taking Cymbalta. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
The following are reasons why Cymbalta may not be suitable for you. Talk to your doctor before you 
take Cymbalta if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>are taking other medicines to treat depression (see  Other medicines and Cymbalta ) </li>
<li>are taking St. John s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum) </li>
<li>have kidney disease </li>
<li>have had seizures (fits) </li>
<li>have had mania </li>
<li>suffer from bipolar disorder </li>
<li>have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) </li>
<li>have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises), especially if you are 
pregnant (see  Pregnancy and breast-feeding ) </li>
<li>are at risk of low sodium levels (for example if you are taking diuretics, especially if you are 
elderly) </li>
<li>are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage </li>
<li>are taking other medicines containing duloxetine (see  Other medicines and Cymbalta ) </li>
</ul>
<p>Cymbalta may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still. You should tell your 
doctor if this happens to you. </p>
<p>Medicines like Cymbalta (so called SSRIs/SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see 
section 4). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Thoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder 
If you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or 
killing yourself. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all 
take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. 
You may be more likely to think like this if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself </li>
<li>are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal 
behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an 
antidepressant </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a 
hospital straight away. </p>
<p>You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety 
disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression 
or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents under 18 years of age 
Cymbalta should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. Also, you should 
know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal 
thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when they take 
this class of medicines. Despite this, your doctor may prescribe Cymbalta for patients under because he/she decides that this is in their best interests. If your doctor has prescribed Cymbalta for a 
patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor. You should inform your 
doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen when patients under 18 are taking 
Cymbalta. Also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, and cognitive and 
behavioural development of Cymbalta in this age group have not yet been demonstrated. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cymbalta 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.  </p>
<p>The main ingredient of Cymbalta, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions:<br />
  diabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence 
Using more than one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided. Check with your doctor if 
you are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine.  </p>
<p>Your doctor should decide whether you can take Cymbalta with other medicines. Do not start or stop 
taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, before 
checking with your doctor. </p>
<p>You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: </p>
<p>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): You should not take Cymbalta if you are taking, or have 
recently taken (within the last 14 days) another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase 
inhibitor (MAOI). Examples of MAOIs include moclobemide (an antidepressant) and linezolid (an 
antibiotic). Taking a MAOI together with many prescription medicines, including Cymbalta, can cause 
serious or even life-threatening side effects. You must wait at least 14 days after you have stopped 
taking an MAOI before you can take Cymbalta. Also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you stop 
taking Cymbalta before you take a MAOI. </p>
<p>Medicines that cause sleepiness: These include medicines prescribed by your doctor including 
benzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital and antihistamines.  </p>
<p>Medicines that increase the level of serotonin: Triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as 
paroxetine and fluoxetine), SNRIs (such as venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (such as 
clomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, St John s Wort and MAOIs (such as moclobemide and 
linezolid). These medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking 
any of these medicines together with Cymbalta, you should see your doctor. </p>
<p>Oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents: Medicines which thin the blood or prevent the blood from 
clotting. These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding. </p>
<p>Cymbalta with food, drink and alcohol 
Cymbalta may be taken with or without food. Care should be taken if you drink alcohol while you are 
being treated with Cymbalta. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
* Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are 
taking Cymbalta. You should use Cymbalta only after discussing the potential benefits and any 
potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure your midwife and/or doctor knows you are on Cymbalta. When taken during 
pregnancy, similar drugs (SSRIs) may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, called 
persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe faster and 
appear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby is born. If 
this happens to your baby you should contact your midwife and/or doctor immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you take Cymbalta near the end of your pregnancy, your baby might have some symptoms 
when it is born. These usually begin at birth or within a few days of your baby being born. 
These symptoms may include floppy muscles, trembling, jitteriness, not feeding properly, 
trouble with breathing and fits. If your baby has any of these symptoms when it is born, or you 
are concerned about your baby s health, contact your doctor or midwife who will be able to 
advise you.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you take Cymbalta near the end of your pregnancy there is an increased risk of excessive 
vaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding disorders. Your 
doctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking duloxetine so they can advise you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available data from the use of Cymbalta during the first three months of pregnancy do not show 
an increased risk of overall birth defects in general in the child. If Cymbalta is taken during the 
second half of pregnancy, there may be an increased risk that the infant will be born early 
(6 additional premature infants for every 100 women who take Cymbalta in the second half of 
pregnancy), mostly between weeks 35 and 36 of pregnancy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. The use of Cymbalta while breastfeeding is not 
recommended. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Cymbalta may make you feel sleepy or dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you 
know how Cymbalta affects you. </p>
<p>Cymbalta contains sucrose 
Cymbalta contains sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some 
sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>Cymbalta contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Cymbalta is for oral use. You should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water. </p>
<p>For depression and diabetic neuropathic pain:<br />
The usual dose of Cymbalta is 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right 
for you.  </p>
<p>For generalised anxiety disorder: 
The usual starting dose of Cymbalta is 30 mg once a day after which most patients will receive 60 mg 
once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you. The dose may be adjusted up 
to 120 mg a day based on your response to Cymbalta. </p>
<p>To help you remember to take Cymbalta, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every day. </p>
<p>Talk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking Cymbalta. Do not stop taking Cymbalta, 
or change your dose, without talking to your doctor. Treating your disorder properly is important to 
help you get better.  If it is not treated, your condition may not go away and may become more serious 
and difficult to treat. </p>
<p>If you take more Cymbalta than you should 
Call your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of Cymbalta prescribed 
by your doctor. Symptoms of overdose include sleepiness, coma, serotonin syndrome (a rare reaction 
which may cause feelings of great happiness, drowsiness, clumsiness, restlessness, feeling of being 
drunk, fever, sweating or rigid muscles), fits, vomiting and fast heart rate. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Cymbalta 
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the 
missed dose and take only a single dose as usual. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
dose. Do not take more than the daily amount of Cymbalta that has been prescribed for you in one day. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Cymbalta 
DO NOT stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. If your 
doctor thinks that you no longer need Cymbalta he or she will ask you to reduce your dose over at 
least 2 weeks before stopping treatment altogether.  </p>
<p>Some patients who stop taking Cymbalta suddenly have had symptoms such as: 
* dizziness, tingling feelings like pins and needles or electric shock-like feelings (particularly in 
the head), sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), fatigue, sleepiness, 
feeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), 
shaking (tremor), headaches, muscle pain, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or 
vertigo. 
These symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms 
that are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
