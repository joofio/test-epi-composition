  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Cyramza is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance ramucirumab, which is a monoclonal 
antibody. This is a specialised protein that can recognise and attach to another protein found on blood 
vessels called  VEGF receptor 2 . This receptor is needed in the development of new blood vessels. To 
grow, cancer needs new blood vessels to develop. By attaching to  VEGF receptor 2  and blocking it 
the medicine cuts off the blood supply to the cancer cells. </p>
<p>Cyramza is given in combination with paclitaxel, another anti-cancer medicine, for the treatment of 
advanced stomach cancer (or cancer of the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach) in 
adults whose disease has worsened after treatment with medicines to treat cancer. </p>
<p>Cyramza is used for the treatment of advanced stomach cancer (or cancer of the junction between the 
oesophagus and the stomach) in adults whose disease has worsened after treatment with medicines to 
treat cancer and for whom treatment of Cyramza in combination with paclitaxel is not suitable. </p>
<p>Cyramza is used to treat advanced cancers of the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine) in 
adults. It is given with other medicines called  FOLFIRI chemotherapy , including  5-fluorouracil , 
 folinic acid , and  irinotecan . </p>
<p>Cyramza is given in combination with erlotinib, another anti-cancer medicine, as the first therapy for 
the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer when the cancer cells have 
specific changes (mutations) in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. </p>
<p>Cyramza is given in combination with docetaxel, another anti-cancer medicine, for the treatment of 
adult patients with advanced stage of lung cancer whose disease has worsened after treatment with 
medicines to treat cancer. </p>
<p>Cyramza is used to treat liver cancer that is advanced or cannot be taken out by surgery, in adults who 
have been previously treated with another anticancer medicine (sorafenib) and who have an elevated 
level of a particular protein in the blood (alpha fetoprotein). </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to ramucirumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).<br />
- if there is X-ray evidence that the lung cancer has a cavity or hole in it or if the lung cancer is 
close to major blood vessels. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Cyramza if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>have any condition which increases the risk of bleeding. Also tell your doctor if you are taking 
any medicines which may increase the risk of bleeding or which affect blood clotting ability. In 
such cases, your doctor will perform regular blood tests to monitor the risk of bleeding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have liver cancer and have had previous bleeding from enlarged veins in your food pipe 
(oesophagus) or have high blood pressure in the portal vein, which carries the blood from the 
bowel and spleen to the liver.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have lung cancer and have had recent bleeding in the lung (coughing up bright red blood) or you 
are regularly taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, or medicines which affect blood 
clotting ability. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have high blood pressure. Cyramza can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. Your 
doctor will make sure that if you already have high blood pressure, it is brought under control 
before starting Cyramza. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure and adjust your blood 
pressure medicine as needed during treatment with Cyramza. Treatment with Cyramza may 
need to be stopped temporarily until high blood pressure is controlled with medicines, or 
stopped permanently if it cannot be adequately controlled.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in a 
blood vessel wall. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are going to have planned surgery, if you had recent surgery or if you have poor wound healing 
after surgery. Cyramza may increase the risk of problems with wound healing. You should not 
receive Cyramza for at least 4 weeks before you undergo planned surgery and your doctor will 
decide when to re-start treatment. If you have a wound that heals poorly during treatment, 
dosing of Cyramza will be stopped until the wound is fully healed.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have severe liver disease ( cirrhosis ) and associated conditions, such as excessive accumulation 
of fluid in your abdomen ( ascites ). Your doctor will discuss with you if the potential benefits 
of treatment are judged to outweigh the potential risks for you. If you have liver cancer your 
doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of confusion and/or disorientation associated 
with chronic liver problems and will stop treatment with Cyramza if you develop these signs 
and symptoms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have severe kidney problems. There are limited data available about the use of Cyramza in 
patients with severely impaired kidney function. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following applies to you (or you are not sure) 
during treatment with Cyramza or anytime thereafter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking of the arteries by a blood clot ( arterial thromboembolic events ): </li>
</ul>
<p>Cyramza can cause blood clots in your arteries. Arterial blood clots can lead to serious 
conditions, including heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of a heart attack may include chest pain 
or heaviness in the chest. Symptoms of a stroke may include sudden numbness or weakness of 
the arm, leg and face, feeling confused, difficulty speaking or understanding others, sudden 
difficulty in walking or loss of balance or coordination or sudden dizziness. Cyramza will be 
permanently stopped if you develop a blood clot in your arteries. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A hole in the wall of your gut ( gastrointestinal perforation ): Cyramza may increase the risk 
of developing a hole in the wall of your gut. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, being 
sick (vomiting), fever or chills. Cyramza will be permanently stopped if you develop a hole in 
the wall of your gut. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severe bleeding: Cyramza may increase the risk of severe bleeding. Symptoms may include: 
extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness or changes in the colour of your stools. Cyramza will be 
permanently stopped if you experience severe bleeding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infusion-related reaction: Infusion-related reactions may happen during treatment because 
Cyramza is given as an intravenous infusion via a drip (see section 3). Your doctor or nurse will 
check for side effects during your infusion. Symptoms may include: increased muscle tension, 
back pain, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, and 
feeling of tingling or numbness in hands or feet. In severe cases, symptoms may include 
breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways, faster heartbeat, and feeling faint. 
Cyramza will be permanently stopped if you experience a severe infusion-related reaction. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rare but serious brain condition called  posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  or 
 PRES : Cyramza may increase the risk of developing this brain condition. Symptoms may 
include fits (seizures), headache, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), blindness or 
reduced level of consciousness, with or without high blood pressure. Cyramza will be stopped if 
you experience this brain condition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cardiac Failure: Cyramza, when given in combination with chemotherapy or erlotinib may 
increase the risk of cardiac failure. Symptoms may include weakness and tiredness, swelling, 
and fluid build-up in the lungs, which can cause shortness of breath. Your symptoms will be 
evaluated and suspension of your treatment with Cyramza may be considered. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abnormal tube-like connections or passageways inside the body ( fistula ): Cyramza may 
increase the risk of abnormal tube-like connections or passageways inside the body between 
internal organs and skin or other tissues. Cyramza will be permanently stopped if you develop a 
fistula. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abnormal urine test ( proteinuria ): Cyramza may increase the risk of developing or 
worsening of abnormal levels of protein in the urine. Treatment with Cyramza may need to be 
stopped temporarily until the levels of protein in the urine decrease and then treatment resumed 
at a lower dose, or stopped permanently if the urine protein level does not reduce sufficiently. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the mouth ( stomatitis ): Cyramza, when given in combination with 
chemotherapy may increase the risk of developing inflammation of the mouth. Symptoms may 
include a burning sensation in the mouth, ulceration, blisters or swelling. Your doctor may 
prescribe treatment to help with the symptoms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever or infection: You may develop a temperature of 38  C or greater during treatment (since 
you might have fewer white blood cells than normal which is very common). Symptoms may 
include sweating or other signs of infection, such as headache, pain in the limbs or decreased 
appetite. Infection (sepsis) may be severe and could lead to death. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elderly people with lung cancer: Your doctor will carefully evaluate the most appropriate 
treatment for you. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Cyramza should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because there is no information 
about how it works in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cyramza 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Before starting treatment you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you 
may be pregnant or you are planning to have a baby. You should avoid getting pregnant while 
receiving this medicine and for at least 3 months after the last dose of Cyramza. Talk to your doctor 
about the best contraception for you. </p>
<p>As Cyramza inhibits the development of new blood vessels, it may decrease the likelihood of you 
becoming pregnant or maintaining a pregnancy. It may also cause damage to your unborn baby. You 
should not use this medicine during pregnancy. If you become pregnant during treatment with 
Cyramza, your doctor will discuss with you if the benefit of treatment for you is greater than any 
possible risk to you or your unborn baby. </p>
<p>It is not known if the medicine passes into breast milk and could affect a breastfed baby. Therefore, 
you should not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Cyramza and for at least 3 months after 
you receive the last dose. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Cyramza has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you experience 
any symptoms affecting your ability to concentrate and react, do not drive or use machines until the 
effect goes away. </p>
<p>Cyramza contains sodium 
Each 10 ml vial contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg), that is to say essentially  sodium free .<br />
Each 50 ml vial contains approximately 85 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt). This is 
equivalent to approximately 4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dosage and frequency of administration 
The correct amount of Cyramza needed to treat your disease will be calculated by your doctor or 
hospital pharmacist depending on your body weight.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose of Cyramza for the treatment of gastric cancer, for the treatment of advanced 
cancer of the colon or rectum and for the treatment of liver cancer is 8 mg per kilogram of your body 
weight once every 2 weeks. </p>
<p>The recommended dose of Cyramza for the treatment of lung cancer is 10 mg per kilogram of your 
body weight once every 2 weeks when given in combination with erlotinib or once every 3 weeks 
when given in combination with docetaxel. </p>
<p>The number of infusions you will receive depends on how you are responding to treatment. Your 
doctor will discuss this with you. </p>
<p>Premedication 
You may be given another medicine to reduce the risk of an infusion-related reaction before you 
receive Cyramza. If you experience an infusion-related reaction during Cyramza therapy, you will be 
given premedication for all future infusions. </p>
<p>Dose adjustments 
During each infusion, your doctor or nurse will check for side effects.  </p>
<p>If you experience an infusion-related reaction during treatment, the time taken to give your infusion 
will be increased for the rest of that infusion and for all future infusions.  </p>
<p>The amount of protein in your urine will be checked regularly during treatment. Depending on the 
protein level measured, Cyramza may be temporarily discontinued. Once the urine protein level has 
decreased to a certain level, treatment may be restarted with a lower dose. </p>
<p>Route and method of administration 
Cyramza is a concentrate for solution for infusion (also called  sterile concentrate ). A hospital 
pharmacist, nurse or doctor will have diluted the contents of the vial with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9%) solution before use. This medicine is given by infusion via a drip over a period of 
approximately 60 minutes.  </p>
<p>Cyramza treatment will be temporarily stopped if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop high blood pressure, until it is controlled with anti-hypertensive medicine </li>
<li>develop wound healing problems, until the wound is healed </li>
<li>will undergo planned surgery, four weeks prior to surgery </li>
</ul>
<p>Cyramza treatment will be permanently stopped if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop a blood clot in your arteries </li>
<li>develop a hole in the wall of your gut </li>
<li>experience severe bleeding </li>
<li>experience a severe infusion-related reaction </li>
<li>develop high blood pressure that cannot be controlled with medicine </li>
<li>are passing more than a certain amount of protein with your urine or if you develop a severe 
kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome) </li>
<li>develop abnormal tube-like connections or passageways inside the body between internal 
organs and skin or other tissues (fistula) </li>
<li>develop confusion and/or disorientation associated with chronic liver problems </li>
<li>decline in kidney function (in the setting of liver failure) </li>
</ul>
<p>When receiving Cyramza in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel 
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are also given by a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion) over a period of 
approximately 60 minutes. If you are receiving Cyramza in combination with either paclitaxel or 
docetaxel on the same day, Cyramza will be given first. </p>
<p>The amount of paclitaxel or docetaxel needed depends on the surface area of your body. Your doctor 
or hospital pharmacist will calculate your body surface area by measuring your height and weight and 
will work out the right dose for you.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose of paclitaxel is 80 mg for every square metre (m ) of your body s surface area 
once every week for 3 weeks followed by 1 week without treatment.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg for every square metre (m ) of your body s surface area 
once every 3 weeks. If you are of East Asian origin, you may receive a reduced docetaxel starting dose 
of 60 mg per every m2 of your body s surface area once every 3 weeks. </p>
<p>Prior to being given any paclitaxel infusion, you will have blood tests to check that your blood counts 
are high enough and that your liver is functioning well. 
Read the paclitaxel or docetaxel package leaflet for further information. </p>
<p>When receiving Cyramza in combination with FOLFIRI 
FOLFIRI chemotherapy is given by intravenous infusion, after the Cyramza infusion has finished. 
Please read the package leaflets for the other medicines that are part of your treatment, to see if they 
are suitable for you. If you are unsure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if there are any reasons 
why you can't use these medicines. </p>
<p>When receiving Cyramza in combination with erlotinib 
Please read the erlotinib package leaflet for information on erlotinib and whether it is suitable for you. 
If you are unsure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if there are any reasons why you can't use 
erlotinib. </p>         </div>"""
