homocystinuria, an inherited (genetic) disease where the amino acid methionine cannot be broken 
down completely by the body. </p>
<p>Methionine is present in regular food protein (e.g. meat, fish, milk, cheese, eggs). It is converted into 
homocysteine which is then normally converted into cysteine during digestion. Homocystinuria is a 
disease caused by the accumulation of homocysteine which is not converted to cysteine and is 
characterised by formation of clots in the veins, bone weakness, and skeletal and crystalline lens 
abnormalities. The use of Cystadane together with other treatments such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, 
folate and a specific diet aims to reduce the elevated homocysteine levels in your body.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Cystadane. 
If you notice side effects like headaches, vomiting or a change in your vision and you are of the 
homocystinuria subtype called CBS (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency), please contact your 
doctor immediately, they could be signs of a swelling in the brain (cerebral oedema). In that case your 
doctor will monitor your methionine level in your body and may review your diet. Your treatment 
with Cystadane may need to be interrupted. 
If you are treated with Cystadane and with an amino-acid mixture and if you need to take other 
medicines at the same time, leave 30 minutes between the intake (see  section  Other medicines and 
Cystadane ). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Cystadane 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
If you are taking amino-acid mixture or medicines such as vigabatrin or Gaba analogues (medicine 
used to treat epilepsy), please tell your doctor as they might interact with your treatment with 
Cystadane. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will decide if you can use this
