Daptomycin is an antibacterial that can stop the growth of certain bacteria. Daptomycin Hospira is used in 
adults and in children and adolescents (age from 1 to 17 years) to treat infections of the skin and the 
tissues below the skin. It is also used to treat infections in the blood when associated with skin infection.  </p>
<p>Daptomycin Hospira is also used in adults to treat infections in the tissues that line the inside of the heart 
(including heart valves) which are caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. It is also 
used to treat infections in the blood caused by the same type of bacteria when associated with heart 
infection.  </p>

If you are allergic to daptomycin or to sodium hydroxide or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>If this applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse. If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor or nurse 
for advice. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Daptomycin Hospira:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have, or have previously had kidney problems. Your doctor may need to change the dose of 
Daptomycin Hospira (see section 3 of this leaflet).  </li>
<li>Occasionally, patients receiving Daptomycin Hospira may develop tender or aching muscles or 
muscle weakness (see section 4 of this leaflet for more information). If this happens tell your doctor. 
Your doctor will make sure you have a blood test and will advise whether or not to continue with 
Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms generally go away within a few days of stopping Daptomycin 
Hospira.  </li>
<li>If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores, or 
serious kidney problems after taking daptomycin. </li>
<li>If you are very overweight. There is a possibility that your blood levels of Daptomycin Hospira 
could be higher than those found in persons of average weight and you may need careful monitoring 
in case of side effects.  </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Daptomycin Hospira.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you develop any of the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serious, acute allergic reactions have been observed in patients treated with nearly all antibacterial 
agents, including Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms can include wheezing, difficulty breathing, 
swelling of the face, neck and throat, rashes and hives, or fever. </li>
<li>
<p>Serious skin disorders have been reported with the use of Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms that 
occur with these skin disorders can include:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a new or worsening fever, </p>
</li>
<li>red raised or fluid-filled skin spots which may start in your armpits or on your chest or groin 
areas and which can spread over a large area of your body, </li>
<li>blisters or sores in your mouth or on your genitals. </li>
<li>A serious kidney problem has been reported with the use of Daptomycin Hospira. The symptoms 
can include fever and rash. </li>
<li>Any unusual tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, loss of feeling or difficulties with 
movements. If this happens, tell your doctor who will decide whether you should continue the 
treatment.  </li>
<li>Diarrhoea, especially if you notice blood or mucus, or if diarrhoea becomes severe or persistent.  </li>
<li>New or worsening fever, cough or difficulty breathing. These may be signs of a rare but serious 
lung disorder called eosinophilic pneumonia. Your doctor will check the condition of your lungs 
and decide whether or not you should continue Daptomycin Hospira treatment.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Daptomycin Hospira may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. The 
results can suggest poor blood clotting when, in fact, there is no problem. Therefore, it is important that 
your doctor takes into account that you are receiving Daptomycin Hospira. Please inform your doctor that 
you are on treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor the health of your muscles both before you start treatment 
and frequently during treatment with Daptomycin Hospira.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Daptomycin Hospira should not be administered to children below one year of age as studies in animals 
have indicated that this age group may experience severe side effects.  </p>
<p>Use in elderly<br />
People over the age of 65 can be given the same dose as other adults, provided their kidneys are working 
well. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Daptomycin Hospira 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.<br />
It is particularly important that you mention the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines called statins or fibrates (to lower cholesterol) or ciclosporin (a medicinal product used in 
transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic 
dermatitis). It is possible that the risk of side effects affecting the muscles may be higher when any 
of these medicines (and some others that can affect muscles) is taken during treatment with 
Daptomycin Hospira. Your doctor may decide not to give you Daptomycin Hospira or to stop the 
other medicine for a while.  </li>
<li>Pain killing medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors 
(e.g. celecoxib). These could interfere with the effects of Daptomycin Hospira in the kidney.  </li>
<li>Oral anti-coagulants (e.g. warfarin), which are medicines that prevent blood from clotting. It may be 
necessary for your doctor to monitor your blood clotting times.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Daptomycin Hospira is not usually given to pregnant women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think 
you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you 
are given this medicine.  </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed if you are receiving Daptomycin Hospira, because it may pass into your breast milk 
and could affect the baby.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>Daptomycin Hospira has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines.  </p>
<p>Daptomycin Hospira contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Adults (18 years of age and above) 
The dose will depend on how much you weigh and the type of infection being treated. The usual dose for 
adults is 4 mg for every kilogram (kg) of body weight once daily for skin infections or 6 mg for every kg 
of body weight once daily for a heart infection or a blood infection associated with skin or heart infection. 
In adult patients, this dose is given directly into your blood stream (into a vein), either as an infusion 
lasting about 30 minutes or as an injection lasting about 2 minutes. The same dose is recommended in 
people aged over 65 years provided their kidneys are working well.  </p>
<p>If your kidneys do not work well, you may receive Daptomycin Hospira less often, e.g. once every other 
day. If you are receiving dialysis, and your next dose of Daptomycin Hospira is due on a dialysis day, you 
will be usually given Daptomycin Hospira after the dialysis session.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) 
The dose for children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) will depend on the age of patient and the type 
of infection being treated. This dose is given directly into the blood stream (into a vein), as an infusion 
lasting about 30-60 minutes. </p>
<p>A course of treatment usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks for skin infections. For blood or heart infections and 
skin infections your doctor will decide how long you should be treated.  </p>
