DARZALEX is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance daratumumab. It belongs to a 
group of medicines called  monoclonal antibodies . Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that have 
been designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body. Daratumumab has been designed 
to attach to specific cancer cells in your body, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer 
cells.
What DARZALEX is used for
DARZALEX is used in adults 18 years or older, who have a type of cancer called  multiple 
myeloma . This is a cancer of your bone marrow.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to daratumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Do not use DARZALEX if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before you are given DARZALEX.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given DARZALEX.
Infusion-related reactions
DARZALEX is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein. Before and after each infusion of DARZALEX, 
you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance of infusion-related reactions (see 
 Medicines given during treatment with DARZALEX  in section 3). These reactions can happen 
during the infusion or in the 3 days after the infusion.
In some cases you may have a severe allergic reaction which may include a swollen face, lips, mouth, 
tongue or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing or an itchy rash (hives). Some serious allergic 
reactions and other severe infusion-related reactions have resulted in death.
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion-related reactions or related 
symptoms listed at the top of section 4. If you get infusion-related reactions, you may need other medicines, or the infusion may need to be 
slowed down or stopped. When these reactions go away, or get better, the infusion can be started 
again.
These reactions are most likely to happen with the first infusion. If you have had an infusion-related 
reaction once it is less likely to happen again. Your doctor may decide not to use DARZALEX if you 
have a strong infusion reaction.
Decreased blood cell counts
DARZALEX can decrease white blood cell counts which help fight infections, and blood cells called 
platelets which help to clot blood. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop any symptoms of 
infection such as fever or any symptoms of decreased platelet counts such as bruising or bleeding.
Blood transfusions
If you need a blood transfusion, you will have a blood test first to match your blood type. 
DARZALEX can affect the results of this blood test. Tell the person doing the test that you are using 
DARZALEX.
Hepatitis B
Tell your doctor if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because 
DARZALEX could cause hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will check you for 
signs of this infection before, during and for some time after treatment with DARZALEX. Tell your 
doctor right away if you get worsening tiredness, or yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes.
Children and adolescents
Do not give DARZALEX to children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known how the medicine will affect them.
Other medicines and DARZALEX
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
This includes medicines you can get without a prescription, and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before you are given this medicine.
If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. 
You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your 
baby.
Contraception
Women who are being given DARZALEX should use effective contraception during treatment and for 
3 months after treatment.
Breast-feeding
You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. 
This is because the medicine may pass into the mother s milk and it is not known how it will affect the 
baby.
Driving and using machines
You may feel tired after taking DARZALEX which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.
DARZALEX contains sorbitol
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic 
disorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which 
may cause serious side effects.
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>How much is given
Your doctor will work out your dose and schedule of DARZALEX. The dose of DARZALEX will 
depend on your body weight.
The usual starting dose of DARZALEX is 16 mg per kg of body weight. DARZALEX may be given 
alone or together with other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma.
When given alone, DARZALEX is given as follows:</p>
<p>once a week for the first 8 weeks</p>
<p>then once every 2 weeks for 16 weeks</p>
<p>then once every 4 weeks after that as long as your condition does not worsen.
When DARZALEX is given together with other medicines your doctor may change the time between 
doses as well as how many treatments you will receive.
In the first week your doctor may give you the DARZALEX dose split over two consecutive days.
How the medicine is given
DARZALEX will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. It is given as a drip into a vein ( intravenous 
infusion ) over several hours.
Medicines given during treatment with DARZALEX
You may be given medicines to lower the chance of getting shingles.
Before each infusion of DARZALEX you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance of 
infusion-related reactions. These may include:</p>
<p>medicines for an allergic reaction (anti-histamines)</p>
<p>medicines for inflammation (corticosteroids)</p>
<p>medicines for fever (such as paracetamol).
After each infusion of DARZALEX you will be given medicines (such as corticosteroids) to lower the 
chance of infusion-related reactions.
People with breathing problems
If you have breathing problems, such as asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), 
you will be given medicines to inhale which help your breathing problems:</p>
<p>medicines to help the airways in your lungs stay open (bronchodilators)</p>
<p>medicines to lower swelling and irritation in your lungs (corticosteroids).
If you are given more DARZALEX than you should
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much 
(an overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects.
If you forget your appointment to have DARZALEX
It is very important to go to all your appointments to make sure your treatment works. If you miss an 
appointment, make another one as soon as possible.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
