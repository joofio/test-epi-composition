Dasselta contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine. </p>
<p>How Dasselta works 
Dasselta is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your allergic 
reaction and its symptoms. </p>
<p>When Dasselta should be used 
Dasselta relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages 
caused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults and adolescents years of age and older. These symptoms include sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy palate, and itchy, 
red or watery eyes. </p>
<p>Dasselta is also used to relieve the symptoms associated with urticaria (a skin condition caused by an 
allergy). These symptoms include itching and hives. </p>
<p>Relief of these symptoms lasts a full day and helps you to resume your normal daily activities and 
sleep. </p>         </div>"""
