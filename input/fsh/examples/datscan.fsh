conditions in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called  radiopharmaceuticals , which contain 
a small amount of radioactivity.<br />
<em> When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a 
short time.<br />
</em> Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body using 
special cameras.<br />
* A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is 
inside the organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information about how that organ 
is working. </p>
<p>When DaTSCAN is injected into an adult, it is carried around the body in the blood. It collects in a small 
area of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in: 
* Parkinsonism (including Parkinson s disease) and<br />
* dementia with Lewy bodies.  </p>
<p>A scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may 
feel that the scan would help in finding out more about your condition and deciding on possible 
treatment. </p>
<p>When DaTSCAN is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than 
in some types of X-ray investigation. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that 
the clinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed 
to these small amounts of radiation. </p>
<p>This medicine is used for diagnostic use only. It is used only to identify illness. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using DaTSCAN if you have a moderate or severe problem 
with your kidneys or liver.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>DaTSCAN is not recommended for children aged 0 to 18 years  </p>
<p>Other medicines and DaTSCAN 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.<br />
Some medicines or substances can affect the way that DaTSCAN works.<br />
These include: 
* buproprion (used to treat depression (sadness)) 
* benzatropine (used to treat Parkinson s disease) 
* mazindol (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity)<br />
<em> sertraline (used to treat depression (sadness)) 
* methylphenidate (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness)) 
* phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity)<br />
</em> amfetamine (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness); also a 
drug of abuse) 
* cocaine (sometimes used as an anaesthetic for nose surgery; also a drug of abuse) </p>
<p>Some medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may ask you to stop taking 
them for a short time before you receive DaTSCAN.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use DaTSCAN if you are pregnant or think you may possibly be pregnant. This is because the 
child may receive some of the radioactivity. Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you think you might be 
pregnant.  Alternative techniques which do not involve radioactivity should be considered. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of DaTSCAN, or ask you to 
stop breast-feeding. It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is passed into breast milk.<br />
<em> You should not breast-feed your child for 3 days after DaTSCAN is given.<br />
</em> Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away any 
breast milk you have expressed.<br />
* You will need to continue to do this for 3 days, until the radioactivity is no longer in your body.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
DaTSCAN has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>DaTSCAN contains alcohol (ethanol) 5 % by volume. Each dose contains up to 197 mg alcohol. This is 
about the same as 5 ml beer, or 2 ml wine. This is harmful for those suffering from alcoholism and needs 
to be taken into account in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and high risk groups such as 
patients with liver disease or epilepsy. Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  </p>         </div>"""

in a hospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and 
qualified to use it safely. They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of this medicine. </p>
<p>Your nuclear medicine doctor will decide the dose that is best for you.  </p>
<p>Before you receive DaTSCAN, your nuclear medicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liquid 
that contain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building-up in your thyroid gland. It is important that 
you take the tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you. </p>
<p>DaTSCAN is given to you as an injection, usually into a vein in your arm. The recommended 
radioactivity given by injection is between 111 to 185 MBq (megabequerel or MBq is a unit used to 
measure radioactivity). A single injection is enough. The camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours 
after the injection of DaTSCAN. </p>
<p>If you are given more DaTSCAN than you should 
Since DaTSCAN is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an 
overdose. Your nuclear medicine doctor will suggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get 
rid of the medicine. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass - your doctor will tell 
you what to do. This is normal practice with medicines like DaTSCAN. Any ioflupane (123I) which 
remains in your body will naturally lose its radioactivity. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who 
supervises the procedure.  </p>         </div>"""
