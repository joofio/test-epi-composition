Daurismo is used with another cancer medicine, cytarabine, to treat adults newly diagnosed with a 
blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). 
How Daurismo works
In AML, cancer cells called stem cells constantly make new leukaemic cancer cells. Daurismo works 
by blocking a key process in these stem cells, called the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This reduces their 
ability to make new cancer cells. By blocking the Hh pathway, Daurismo can also make cancer cells 
more sensitive to a cancer medicine, cytarabine, used to treat AML. Combining Daurismo with the
medicine cytarabine may increase how long patients are likely to live by decreasing growth of the 
cancer and possibly by increasing cancer cell death. 
If you have any questions about how Daurismo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""
