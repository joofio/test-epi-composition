section 6). </li>
<li>if you have very low levels of albumin, in the blood. </li>
<li>if you are taking medicines that strongly increase the activity of a certain liver enzyme called 
 CYP450 3A4  (e.g. carbamazepine [a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures]). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Deltyba. 
Before you start taking Deltyba, and during the treatment, your doctor may check your heart s 
electrical activity using an ECG (electrocardiogram) machine (electrical recording of the heart). Your 
doctor may also perform a blood test to check the concentration of some minerals and proteins which 
are important for the function of your heart. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have one of the following conditions: 
* you have reduced levels of albumin, potassium, magnesium or calcium in the blood. 
* you have been told that you have heart problems, for example a slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) 
or have a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction). 
* if you have a condition called congenital long QT syndrome or have a serious heart disease or 
problems with heart rhythm. 
* you have liver disease or severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine: 
* if you experience reappearance or worsening of symptoms of tuberculosis (see 4. Possible side 
effects). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Deltyba is not suitable for children with a body weight of less than 10 kg because there are not enough 
data available in those patients to determinate the correct doses. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Deltyba 
Tell your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </li>
<li>if you are taking medicines to treat an abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, 
dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol). </li>
<li>if you are taking medicines to treat psychoses (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, 
chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine) or depression. </li>
<li>if you are taking certain antimicrobial medicines (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, 
moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin, bedaquiline, or pentamidine). </li>
<li>if you are taking triazole antifungal medicines (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole). </li>
<li>if you are taking certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, 
mizolastine). </li>
<li>if you are taking certain medicines to treat malaria (e.g. halofantrine, quinine, chloroquine, 
artesunate/amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine). </li>
<li>if you are taking any of the following: cisapride (used to treat stomach disorders), droperidol 
(used against vomiting and migraine), domperidone (used against nausea and vomiting), 
diphemanil (used to treat stomach disorders or excessive sweating), probucol (lowers the level 
of cholesterol in the bloodstream), levomethadyl or methadone (used for the treatment of opiate 
addiction), vinca alkaloids (anti-cancer medicines), or arsenic trioxide (used to treat certain 
types of leukaemia). </li>
<li>if you are taking HIV-medicines containing lopinavir/ritonavir, or saquinavir. 
You may be more at risk for dangerous changes of the heart rhythm. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Deltyba may cause harm to an unborn baby. It is not usually recommended for use during pregnancy. 
It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to get 
pregnant. Your doctor will weigh up the benefits to you against the risks to your baby of taking 
Deltyba whilst you are pregnant. 
It is not known if delamanid passes into breast milk in humans. Breast-feeding is not recommended 
during treatment with Deltyba. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Deltyba is expected to have a moderate influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you 
experience side effects that might affect your ability to concentrate and react, do not drive or use 
machines. </p>
<p>Deltyba 50 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you take more Deltyba than you should 
If you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, contact your doctor or your local hospital.
