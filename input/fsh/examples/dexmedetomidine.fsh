effects occur. See section 4 for more information. 
An increased mortality risk has been seen for patients 65 years of age and under when using this 
medicine, especially for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for other reasons than after surgery 
with a more severe disease condition on admission to the intensive care unit and with a younger age.

benefit and risks of this medicine for you, compared to treatment with other sedatives. </p>
