check with your child s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Dosage 
The dose is adjusted by the doctor according to your child s age, weight and condition, generally 
50 mg per kg bodyweight and per day.  </p>
<p>When to take Diacomit 
Your child should take this medicine two or three times a day at regular intervals as directed by your 
child s doctor, for example morning - noon - bedtime to cover the night-and-day period.  </p>
<p>Dose adjustment 
Dose increases should be gradual, taking place over a few weeks while the dose(s) of the other 
antiepileptic medicine(s) is (are) reduced at the same time. Your child s doctor will tell you the new 
dose of the other antiepileptic medicine(s). </p>
<p>If you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
child s doctor or pharmacist. The dose will be adjusted by the doctor according to your child s 
condition.  </p>
<p>There are slight differences between the Diacomit capsules and powder for oral suspension. If your 
child experiences any problems when switching from taking the capsules to the powder for oral 
suspension or vice versa please inform your doctor. In case of switch between capsule and powder 
formulations it should be done under the close supervision of your child s doctor. </p>
<p>In case of vomiting within the first few minutes of intake it is assumed that no medicine has been 
absorbed and a new dose should be given. 
However, the situation is different if the vomiting occurs more than one hour after medicine intake 
because stiripentol is quickly absorbed.<br />
In such a case, it is assumed that a significant fraction of the administered dose has been absorbed 
systemically from the digestive tract. Thus, there would be no need for a new intake or for an 
adjustment of the next dose. </p>
<p>How to take the Diacomit capsules 
To ensure that the whole amount of powder is taken by the patient, it is preferable not to open the 
capsule and to swallow it as a single oral administration unit form. Your child should take Diacomit 
with food, it should NOT be taken on an empty stomach. For food and drinks to be avoided, see the 
section  Diacomit with food and drink  above.  </p>
<p>If your child takes more Diacomit than he or she should 
Contact your child s doctor if you know or think your child has taken more medicine than he or she 
should have.  </p>
<p>If your child forgets to take Diacomit 
It is important that your child takes this medicine regularly at the same time each day. If your child 
forgets to take a dose, he or she should take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for the next 
dose. In that case carry on with the next dose as normal. Your child should not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten individual dose. </p>
<p>If your child stops taking Diacomit 
Your child must not stop taking this medicine unless the doctor tells you to. Stopping treatment 
suddenly can lead to an outbreak of seizures. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child s doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
