<p>Dovato is used to treat HIV in adults and adolescents over 12 years old who weigh at least 40 kg. </p>
<p>Dovato does not cure HIV infection; it keeps the amount of virus in your body at a low level. This helps 
maintain the number of CD4 cells in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that are important 
in helping your body to fight infection. </p>

sclerosis). </p>
<p>If you think any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Some people taking Dovato or other combination treatments for HIV are more at risk of serious side effects 
than others. You need to be aware of the extra risks: 
* if you have moderate or severe liver disease 
* if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B infection, don t 
stop Dovato without your doctor s advice, as your hepatitis may come back) 
* if you have a kidney problem. 
  Talk to your doctor before using Dovato if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-
ups, including blood tests, while you re taking your medicine. See section 4 for more information. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
Dovato contains dolutegravir. Dolutegravir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity 
reaction. You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you re taking Dovato. 
  Read the information  Allergic reactions  in section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. These 
include:<br />
* symptoms of infections and inflammation 
* joint pain, stiffness and bone problems. 
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you re taking Dovato.<br />
  Read the information  Other possible side effects  in section 4 of this leaflet.  </p>
<p>Children 
This medicine is not for use in children under 12 years of age, because it has not been studied in these 
patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Dovato 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Don't take Dovato with the following medicine: 
* fampridine (also known as dalfampridine), used in multiple sclerosis. </p>
<p>Some medicines can affect how Dovato works or make it more likely that you will have side effects. Dovato 
can also affect how some other medicines work. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines in the following list: 
* metformin, to treat diabetes 
* medicines called antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn. Do not take an antacid during the 
6 hours before you take Dovato, or for at least 2 hours after you take it (see also section 3,  How to 
take Dovato ) 
* supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium. If you take Dovato with 
food, you can take supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium at the same 
time as Dovato. If you do not take Dovato with food, do not take a supplement or multivitamin 
containing calcium, iron or magnesium during the 6 hours before you take Dovato, or for at least 
2 hours after you take it (see also section 3,  How to take Dovato ) 
* emtricitabine, etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine or tipranavir/ritonavir, to treat HIV infection 
* medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, mannitol, 
lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly 
* cladribine, to treat leukaemia or multiple sclerosis<br />

* phenytoin and phenobarbital, to treat epilepsy 
* oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine, to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder 
* St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy to treat depression. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your doctor may decide to adjust 
your dose or that you need extra check ups. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby:<br />
  Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Dovato.  </p>
<p>Taking Dovato at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may increase the 
risk of a birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed spinal cord). </p>
<p>If you could get pregnant while taking Dovato: </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom or 
pills. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will 
review your treatment. Do not stop taking Dovato without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and 
your unborn child.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to 
the baby in breast milk.  </p>
<p>A small amount of the ingredients in Dovato can also pass into your breast milk.  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon 
as possible.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Dovato can make you dizzy, and have other side effects that make you less alert. </p>
<p>Don t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure you re not affected.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Allergic reactions 
Dovato contains dolutegravir. Dolutegravir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity 
reaction. This is an uncommon reaction (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) in people taking dolutegravir. If 
you get any of the following symptoms: 
  skin rash 
  a high temperature (fever) 
  lack of energy (fatigue) 
  swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing 
  muscle or joint aches.

<p>Very common side effects<br />
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people: 
  headache 
  diarrhoea 
  feeling sick (nausea).  </p>
<p>Common side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 10 people: 
  depression (feelings of deep sadness and unworthiness) 
  rash 
  itching (pruritus)

  dizziness 
  feeling drowsy 
  difficulty sleeping (insomnia) 
  abnormal dreams 
  lack of energy (fatigue) 
  hair loss 
  anxiety

  muscle pain. </p>
<p>Common side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
  increase in the level of liver enzymes (aminotransferases) 
  increase in the level of enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase). </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 100 people: 
  inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) 
  suicidal attempt (particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before) 
  suicidal thoughts (particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before). 
  panic attack </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
  a decreased number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia) 
  a low red blood cell count (anaemia) or low white blood cell count (neutropenia). </p>
<p>Rare side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: 
  liver failure (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes or unusually dark 
urine) 
  swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing 
  inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) 
  breakdown of muscle tissue. 
  suicide (particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before) </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any mental health problems (see also other mental 
health problems above). </p>
<p>Rare side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
  increase in bilirubin (a test of liver function) 
  increase in an enzyme called amylase. </p>
<p>Very rare side effects 
These may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people: 
  lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) 
  numbness, tingly feelings in the skin (pins and needles) 
  sensation of weakness in the limbs. </p>
<p>Very rare side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
  a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia). </p>
<p>Other possible side effects 
People taking combination therapy for HIV may get other side effects. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation<br />
People with advanced HIV infection or AIDS have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop 
serious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been  silent  and not detected by the 
weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes 
stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. Symptoms 
usually include fever, plus some of the following: 
  headache 
  stomach ache 
  difficulty breathing. 
In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune 
disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking 
medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
  palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
  hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) 
  weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately. Don t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor s 
advice. </p>
<p>Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue are permanently damaged because of reduced blood supply to the bone. 
People may be more likely to get this condition: 
  if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
  if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
  if they drink alcohol 
  if their immune systems are very weak 
  if they are overweight. </p>
<p>Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
  stiffness in the joints 
  aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
  difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects:<br />
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is 
partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor 
will test for these changes. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed 
in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
