This medicine contains two active ingredients called aclidinium and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. 
Both belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. Bronchodilators relax the muscles in your 
airways, which allows the airways to open more widely and helps you to breathe more easily. The 
Genuair inhaler delivers the active ingredients directly into your lungs as you breathe in. </p>
<p>What Duaklir Genuair is used for 
Duaklir Genuair is used for adult patients who have breathing difficulties due to a lung disease called 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in which the airways and air sacs in the lungs become 
damaged or blocked. By opening the airways, the medicine helps relieve symptoms such as shortness 
of breath. Taking Duaklir Genuair regularly will reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life. </p>         </div>"""
