advice to avoid diarrhoeal diseases. </p>

Do not give this vaccine to children younger than 2 years since the protection has not been studied in 
this group. </p>

Do not take other medicine starting 1 hour before until 1 hour after taking the vaccine.<br />

Adults and children from 6 years of age: The primary vaccination is 2 doses taken orally (by mouth) 
at least 1 week (up to 6 weeks) apart.<br />
  Take the 1st dose no later than 2 weeks before you leave for your trip. 
  Take the 2nd dose at least 1 week after the 1st dose and at least 1 week before your trip.<br />
It takes about 1 week after the last dose for protection to begin. 
For continuous protection, re-vaccination is recommended within 2 years. If you had your last dose of 
vaccine less than 2 years ago a single dose will renew your protection. If more than 2 years have 
passed since you had the last vaccine dose, the primary vaccination (2 doses) should be repeated. </p>
<p>Children of 2 to below 6 years of age: The primary vaccination is 3 doses taken orally (by mouth) at 
least 1 week (up to 6 weeks) apart. Only half of the amount of the buffer solution should be mixed 
with the vaccine.<br />
  Give the 1st dose to the child no later than 3 weeks before you leave for your trip.<br />
  Give the 2nd dose to the child at least 1 week after the 1st dose.<br />
  Give the 3rd dose at least one week after the 2nd dose and at least one week before your trip. </p>
<p>It takes about 1 week after the last dose for protection to begin. 
For continuous protection, re-vaccination is recommended within 6 months. If less than 6 months 
have passed since the last vaccination a single dose will renew the protection. If more than 6 months 
have passed since the last vaccination, the primary vaccination (3 doses) should be repeated. </p>
<p>The suspensionsupplied in a single-dose glass vial is a whitish suspension. Each vial comes with one 
sachet package that contains a white effervescent powder of sodium hydrogen carbonate.  The 
effervescent powder should be dissolved in a glass of cool water, and the resulting buffer solution 
should be mixed with the suspension. It is important to use the buffer solution, as it protects the 
vaccine from the gastric acid. </p>
<p>Drink the entire mixture within 2 hours after mixing with the buffer solution. 
Instructions for use: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To prepare the buffer solution, dissolve the effervescent powder in a glass of cool water 
(approx. 150 ml) by gently stirring.<br />
Do not use any other liquid. 
For children of 2 to below6 years: pour away half of the buffer solution.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shake the Dukoral  suspension vial (1 vial = 1 dose). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the content of the Dukoral  suspension vial into the glass of buffer solution (see 1).<br />
Mix by gently stirring. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drink the entire mixture within 2 hours. Avoid food and drink starting 1 hour before 
 until 1 hour after drinking the mixture.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you take more Dukoral than you should 
If you take the doses less than one week apart, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
