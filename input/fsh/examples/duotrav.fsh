the eye, which lowers its pressure. Timolol is a beta blocker which works by reducing the production 
of fluid within the eye. The two substances work together to reduce pressure within the eye. </p>
<p>DuoTrav eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye in adults, including the elderly. This

<p>if you are allergic to travoprost, prostaglandins, timolol, beta blockers or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>if you have now or have had in the past respiratory problems such as asthma, severe chronic 
obstructive bronchitis (severe lung disease which may cause wheeziness, difficulty in breathing 
and/or long-standing cough), or other types of breathing problems. </p>
<p>if you have severe hay fever. </p>
<p>if you have a slow heartbeat, heart failure or a disorder of heart rhythm (irregular heartbeat). </p>
<p>if the surface of your eye is cloudy. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice if any of these applies to you. </p>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using DuoTrav if you have now or have had in the past </p>
<p>coronary heart disease (symptoms can include chest pain or tightness, breathlessness or 
choking), heart failure, low blood pressure. </p>
<p>disturbances of heart rate such as slow heartbeat. </p>
<p>breathing problems, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. </p>
<p>poor blood circulation disease (such as Raynaud s disease or Raynaud s syndrome). </p>
<p>diabetes (as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of low blood sugar). </p>
<p>overactivity of the thyroid gland (as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of thyroid disease). </p>
<p>myasthenia gravis (chronic neuromuscular weakness). </p>
<p>cataract surgery. </p>
<p>eye inflammation. </p>
<p>If you need to have any type of surgery, tell your doctor that you are using DuoTrav as timolol may 
change the effects of some medicines used during anaesthesia. </p>
<p>If you get any severe allergic reaction (skin rash, redness and itching of the eye) while using DuoTrav, 
whatever the cause, adrenaline treatment may not be as effective. It is therefore important to tell the 
doctor that you are using DuoTrav when you are to receive any other treatment. </p>
<p>DuoTrav may change the colour of your iris (the coloured part of your eye). This change may be 
permanent. </p>
<p>DuoTrav may increase the length, thickness, colour and/or number of your eyelashes and may cause 
unusual hair growth on your eyelids. </p>
<p>Travoprost may be absorbed through the skin and therefore should not be used by women who are 
pregnant or are attempting to become pregnant. If any of the medicine comes into contact with the skin 
then it should be washed off straight away. </p>
<p>Children 
DuoTrav is not to be used by children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and DuoTrav 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>DuoTrav can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for the 
treatment of glaucoma. Tell your doctor if you are using or intend to use medicines to lower blood 
pressure, heart medicines including quinidine (used to treat heart conditions and some types of 
malaria), medicines to treat diabetes or the antidepressants fluoxetine or paroxetine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Do not use DuoTrav if you are pregnant unless your doctor considers it necessary. If you could get 
pregnant you must use adequate contraception whilst you use the medicine. </p>
<p>Do not use DuoTrav if you are breast-feeding. DuoTrav may get into your milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after you use DuoTrav. DuoTrav may also 
cause hallucinations, dizziness, nervousness or fatigue in some patients. </p>
<p>Do not drive or use machines until any such symptoms has worn off. </p>
<p>DuoTrav contains hydrogenated castor oil and propylene glycol which may cause skin reactions 
and irritation. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, tear open the overwrap (picture 1), remove 
the bottle and write the date of opening on the label in the space provided. </p>
<p>Make sure you have a mirror available. </p>
<p>Wash your hands. </p>
<p>Twist off the bottle cap. </p>
<p>Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. </p>
<p>Tilt your head back. Pull your lower eyelid down with a clean finger until there is a  pocket<br />
between the eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 2). </p>
<p>Bring the bottle dropper close to the eye. Use the mirror if it helps. </p>
<p>Do not touch your eye or eyelid, the surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It 
could infect the drops. </p>
<p>Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of DuoTrav at a time (picture 3). If a drop misses 
your eye, try again. </p>
<p>After using DuoTrav, press your finger into the corner of your eye by your nose for 2 minutes 
(picture 4). This helps to stop DuoTrav getting into the rest of the body. </p>
<p>If you have to use DuoTrav in both eyes, repeat the above steps for your other eye. </p>
<p>Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use. </p>
<p>Only use one bottle at a time. Do not open the overwrap until you need to use the bottle. </p>
<p>Use DuoTrav for as long as your doctor has told you to. </p>
<p>If you use more DuoTrav than you should 
If you use more DuoTrav than you should, rinse it all out with warm water. Do not put in any more 
drops until it is time for your next regular dose. </p>
<p>If you forget to use DuoTrav 
If you forget to use DuoTrav, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for the forgotten dose. The dose should not exceed one drop daily in the affected eye(s). </p>
<p>If you stop using DuoTrav 
If you stop using DuoTrav without speaking to your doctor the pressure in your eye will not be 
controlled, which could lead to loss of sight. 
If you are using other eye drops in addition to DuoTrav, leave at least 5 minutes between applying 
DuoTrav and the other drops. </p>
<p>If you wear soft contact lenses do not use the drops with your lenses in. After using the drops wait 
15 minutes before putting your lenses back in. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
