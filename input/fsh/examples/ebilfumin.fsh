<li>Ebilfumin is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn 
babies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu 
virus is known to be going round in your community. </li>
<li>Ebilfumin can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of 
age for preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis   for instance, if you have been in contact with 
someone who has flu. </li>
<li>Ebilfumin may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term 
newborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances   for example, if there 
is a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide 
sufficient protection.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Ebilfumin contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase 
inhibitors. These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease 
or prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. </p>
<p>Influenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden 
fever (more than 37.8  C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme 
tiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only occurs 
during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. Outside 
epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). 
Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Ebilfumin. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ebilfumin. 
Before you take Ebilfumin, make sure the prescribing doctor knows 
* if you are allergic to other medicines 
* if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment 
* if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation 
* if your immune system is not working 
* if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. </p>
<p>During treatment with Ebilfumin, tell a doctor immediately: 
* if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and 
adolescents. These may be signs of rare but serious side effects. </p>
<p>Ebilfumin is not a flu vaccine 
Ebilfumin is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you 
antibodies against the virus. Ebilfumin will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you 
might be prescribed both by your doctor. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ebilfumin 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are 
particularly important: 
* chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) 
* methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) 
* phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) 
* probenecid (used to treat gout) </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get 
pregnant so that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. </p>
<p>The effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding 
so that your doctor can decide if Ebilfumin is right for you. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ebilfumin has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Ebilfumin contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>For treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and 
one in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel 
better quickly. </p>
<p>For patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. </p>
<p>For preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It 
is best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. </p>
<p>In special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment 
will continue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. </p>

<p>Method of administration 
Swallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. </p>
<p>Ebilfumin can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance 
of feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). </p>
<p>People who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid form of this medicine (oral 
suspension). If you need an oral suspension but it s not available from your pharmacy, you can 
make a liquid form of Ebilfumin from these capsules. See Making Liquid Ebilfumin at home for 
instructions. </p>
<p>If you take more Ebilfumin than you should 
Stop taking Ebilfumin and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
In most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, 
they were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. Overdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when oseltamivir was given to children 
than to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Ebilfumin for 
children and when administering Ebilfumin capsules or liquid Ebilfumin to children. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Ebilfumin 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Ebilfumin 
There are no side effects when you stop Ebilfumin. But if Ebilfumin is stopped earlier than your 
doctor told you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your 
doctor prescribed. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

skin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour

and neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing 
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life- threatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, initially

areas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure
