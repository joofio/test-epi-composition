(Mucopolysaccharidosis II) when the level of the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase in the body is lower 
than normal, helping improve the symptoms of the disease. If you suffer from Hunter syndrome, a 
carbohydrate called glycosaminoglycan which is normally broken down by your body, is not broken 
down and slowly accumulates in various organs in your body. This causes cells to function 
abnormally, thereby causing problems for various organs in your body which can lead to tissue 
destruction and organ malfunction and failure. Typical organs where glycosaminoglycan accumulates 
are spleen, liver, lungs, heart, and connective tissue. In some patients glycosaminoglycan accumulates 
also in the brain. Elaprase contains an active substance called idursulfase which works by acting as a
replacement for the enzyme that is at a low level, thereby breaking down this carbohydrate in affected 
cells.
Enzyme replacement therapy is usually administered as a long-term treatment.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using this medicine.
If you are treated with Elaprase you may experience side effects during or following an infusion (see 
section 4 Possible side effects). The most common symptoms are itching, rash, hives, fever, headache, 
increased blood pressure, and flushing (redness). Most of the time you can still be given this medicine 
even if these symptoms occur. If you experience an allergic side effect following administration of this 
medicine, you should contact your doctor immediately. You may be given additional medicines such 
as antihistamines and corticosteroids to treat or help prevent allergic-type reactions.
If severe allergic reactions occur, your doctor will stop the infusion immediately, and start giving you 
suitable treatment. You may need to stay in hospital.
The nature of your genotype (a genetic make up of all active genes in human cells, which determines 
one s specific, individual characteristics) may influence your therapeutic response to this medicine, as 
well as your risk of developing antibodies and infusion-related side effects. In individual cases, so-
called  neutralising antibodies  may develop, which may diminish activity of Elaprase and your
response to treatment. The longer term effects of antibody development on response to treatment have 
not been established. Please consult your doctor for additional information.
