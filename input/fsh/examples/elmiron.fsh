Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking elmiron if you have:

blood clotting 
* ever had a reduced number of blood platelets caused by the medicine called heparin 
* reduced liver or kidney function </p>
<p>Rare cases of retinal disorders (pigmentary maculopathy) have been reported with use of elmiron 
(especially after long term use). Tell your doctor immediately if you experience visual changes such as 
difficulty when reading, visual distortions, altered colour vision and/or slower adjustment to low or 
reduced light. Your doctor will discuss with you whether the treatment should be continued. For early 
detection of retinal disorders, eye examination will be performed regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
elmiron is not recommended in children under 18 years as safety and efficacy have not been 
established in this group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and elmiron 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor or pharmacist, particularly if you use medicines that prevent blood clotting, or 
painkillers that reduce blood clotting. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
elmiron is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines

<p>elmiron contains sodium. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
