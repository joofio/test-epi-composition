protein. Factor VIII is a protein produced naturally in the body and is necessary for the blood to form clots 
and stop bleeding.  </p>
<p>ELOCTA is a medicine used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in all age groups of patients with 
haemophilia A (inherited bleeding disorder caused by factor VIII deficiency). </p>
<p>ELOCTA is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived 
components in the manufacturing process.  </p>
<p>How ELOCTA works 
In patients with haemophilia A, factor VIII is missing or not working properly. ELOCTA is used to replace 
the missing or deficient factor VIII. ELOCTA increases factor VIII level in the blood and temporarily 
corrects the bleeding tendency. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ELOCTA. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a small chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ELOCTA. Signs of allergic reactions may include generalised itching, hives, tightness of 
the chest, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If any of these symptoms occur, stop the 
injection immediately and contact your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
your or your child s bleeding is not being controlled with ELOCTA, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cardiovascular events 
If you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, take special care when using factor VIII medicines 
and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Catheter-related complications 
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. </p>
<p>Documentation 
It is strongly recommended that every time ELOCTA is given, the name and batch number of the product are 
recorded. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ELOCTA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
No effects on ability to drive or use of machines have been observed. </p>
<p>ELOCTA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . 
However, depending on your body weight and dose, you could receive more than one vial. This should be 
taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

haemophilia. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you (see Instructions for preparation 
and administration). Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. </p>
<p>ELOCTA is given as an injection into a vein. Your doctor will calculate the dose of ELOCTA (in 
International Units or  IU ) depending on your individual needs for factor VIII replacement therapy and on 
whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding 
is not being controlled with the dose you receive. </p>
<p>How often you need an injection will depend on how well ELOCTA is working for you. Your doctor will 
perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels in your blood.  </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding<br />
The dose of ELOCTA is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved. 
The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of ELOCTA is 50 IU per kg of body weight, given every 3 to 5 days. The dose may be 
adjusted by your doctor in the range of 25 to 65 IU per kg of body weight. In some cases, especially in 
younger patients, shorter dosing intervals or higher doses may be necessary. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
ELOCTA can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12, higher doses 
or more frequent injections may be needed. </p>
<p>If you use more ELOCTA than you should 
Tell your doctor as soon as possible. You should always use ELOCTA exactly as your doctor has told you, 
check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. </p>
<p>If you forget to use ELOCTA 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take your dose as soon as you remember and 
then resume your normal dosing schedule. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you stop using ELOCTA 
Do not stop using ELOCTA without consulting your doctor. If you stop using ELOCTA you may no longer 
be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not stop. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this 
happens the medicines may stop working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this
