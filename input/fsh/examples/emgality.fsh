<li>if you are allergic to galcanezumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).   </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or during treatment with Emgality if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have a serious cardiovascular disease. Emgality has not been studied in patients with 
serious cardiovascular diseases. </li>
</ul>
<p>Look out for allergic reactions 
Emgality can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. Serious allergic reactions happen mainly 
within 1 day after having taken Emgality, but some reactions can be delayed (happen more than 1 day 
to 4 weeks after having taken Emgality). Some allergic reactions can be prolonged in duration. You 
must look out for signs of these reactions while you are using Emgality. Stop using Emgality and tell 
your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs of a serious allergic reaction. 
Such signs are listed under  Serious side effects  in section 4. Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Emgality<br />
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are a woman able to have children, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant while using 
Emgality.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Emgality in pregnancy as the 
effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known.  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. 
You and your doctor should decide if you should breast feed and use Emgality .    </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Galcanezumab could have a minor effect on your ability to drive and use machines. Some patients 
have had vertigo whilst using Emgality.  </p>
<p>Emgality contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .  </p>         </div>"""
