disoproxil. Both of these active substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to treat HIV 
infection. Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor. However, both are generally known as NRTIs and they work by interfering with the 
normal working of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to reproduce itself.  </p>
<p>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 
(HIV-1) infection in adults.  </p>
<p>It is also used to treat HIV in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg, 
and who have already been treated with other HIV medicines that are no longer effective or have 
caused side effects. </p>
<ul>
<li>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should always be used combined with other 
medicines to treat HIV infection.  </li>
<li>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can be administered in place of emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil used separately at the same doses. </li>

may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. </p>
<p>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is also used to reduce the risk of getting HIV-1 
infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg,

HIV if you are allergic to emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Before taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to reduce the risk of getting HIV: </p>
<p>This medicine can only help reduce your risk of getting HIV before you are infected. </p>
<p>You must be HIV negative before you start to take this medicine to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV. You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV infection. Do not take this 
medicine to reduce your risk unless you are confirmed to be HIV negative. People who do have HIV 
must take this medicine in combination with other drugs. </p>
<p>Many HIV tests can miss a recent infection. If you get a flu-like illness, it could mean you have 
recently been infected with HIV. These may be signs of HIV infection: </p>
<p>tiredness </p>
<p>fever </p>
<p>joint or muscle aches </p>
<p>headache </p>
<p>vomiting or diarrhoea </p>
<p>rash </p>
<p>night sweats </p>
<p>enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin 
  Tell your doctor about any flu-like illness   either in the month before starting this medicine, or 
at any time while taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to reduce the risk of getting HIV: </p>
<p>Take this medicine every day to reduce your risk, not just when you think you have been at risk of 
HIV infection. Do not miss any doses of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, or stop taking it. 
Missing doses may increase your risk of getting HIV infection. </p>
<p>Get tested for HIV regularly. </p>
<p>If you think you were infected with HIV, tell your doctor straight away. They may want to do more 
tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. </p>
<p>Just taking this Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may not stop you getting HIV. </p>
<p>Always practice safer sex. Use condoms to reduce contact with semen, vaginal fluids, or blood. </p>
<p>Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, such as toothbrushes 
and razor blades. </p>
<p>Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment. </p>
<p>Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea. These 
infections make it easier for HIV to infect you. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor if you have any more questions about how to prevent getting HIV or spreading HIV to other 
people. </p>
<p>While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV: </p>
<p>Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may affect your kidneys. Before and during treatment, your 
doctor may order blood tests to measure kidney function. Tell your doctor if you have had kidney 
disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems. This medicine should not be given to adolescents 
with existing kidney problems. If you have kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop 
taking emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or, if you already have HIV, to take emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil less frequently. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended if you have severe 
kidney disease or are on dialysis.  </p>
<p>Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass.  The most pronounced bone loss was seen in 
clinical studies when patients were treated for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with a 
boosted protease inhibitor.  </p>
<p>Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk in adult 
and paediatric patients are uncertain.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis.  Patients with osteoporosis are at a higher 
risk of fractures.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients infected 
with HIV who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are treated with 
antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. If you have 
hepatitis B or C, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. </p>
<p>Know your hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status before starting Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan. If you have HBV, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop taking 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, whether or not you also have HIV. It is important not to stop taking 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil without talking to your doctor: see section 3, Do not stop taking 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are over 65. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in 
patients over 65 years of age. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are intolerant to lactose (see Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
contains lactose later in this section). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not for use in children under 12 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan </p>
<p>Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan if you are already taking other medicines that 
contain the components of this medicine (which are emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), or any other 
antiviral medicines that contain tenofovir, alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. </p>
<p>Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with other medicines that can damage your 
kidneys: it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, including </p>
<p>aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection)  </p>
<p>amphotericin B (for fungal infection)  </p>
<p>foscarnet (for viral infection)  </p>
<p>ganciclovir (for viral infection)  </p>
<p>pentamidine (for infections)  </p>
<p>vancomycin (for bacterial infection)  </p>
<p>interleukin-2 (to treat cancer)  </p>
<p>cidofovir (for viral infection)  </p>
<p>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) </p>
<p>If you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat HIV, your doctor may order 
blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function. </p>
<p>It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. </p>
<p>Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with other medicines containing didanosine (for 
treatment of HIV infection): Taking emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with other antiviral medicines that 
contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, 
inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes causes 
death, have been reported when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken 
together. Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and 
didanosine.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with food and drink </p>
<p>Whenever possible, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be taken with food.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you have taken Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan during your pregnancy, your doctor may request 
regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose 
mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of 
side effects. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. This is 
because the active substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy while taking this medicine, do not 
drive and do not use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains lactose </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Possible serious side effects: </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect. 
Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in people with 
liver disease. The following may be signs of lactic acidosis:  </p>
<p>deep rapid breathing </p>
<p>drowsiness </p>
<p>feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)  </p>
<p>stomach pain </p>
<p>If you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately.  </p>
<p>Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a 
history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.  </p>
<p>Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur after 
you start taking medicines to treat HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months 
after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>muscle weakness </li>
<li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body </li>
<li>palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity </li>

be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin in patches </p>
<p>other allergic reactions, such as wheezing, swelling or feeling light-headed </p>
<p>Tests may also show: </p>
<p>low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to infection) </p>
<p>increased triglycerides (fatty acids), bile or sugar in the blood </p>
<p>liver and pancreas problems </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects

<p>pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas </p>
<p>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat </p>
<p>anaemia (low red blood cell count) </p>
<p>breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness which may occur due to damage to the kidney tubule 
cells </p>
<p>Tests may also show: </p>
<p>decreases in potassium in the blood </p>
<p>increased creatinine in your blood </p>
<p>changes to your urine </p>
<p>Rare side effects

<p>softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) </p>
<p>back pain caused by kidney problems </p>
<p>Damage to kidney tubule cells may be associated with breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with 
bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium

<p>If you notice any of the side effects listed above or if any of the side effects get serious, talk to 
your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>The frequency of the following side effects is not known.  </p>
<p>Bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone 
tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking 
corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be 
some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are: </p>
<p>joint stiffness </p>
<p>joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) </p>
<p>difficulty with movement </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </p>
<p>During treatment for HIV there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. </p>
<p>Other effects in children  </p>
<p>Children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including:</p>
<ul>
<li>darkening of the skin in patches. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia).<br />
- this may cause the child to be tired or breathless. </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects
