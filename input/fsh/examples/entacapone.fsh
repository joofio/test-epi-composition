<em> if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as pheochromocytoma; this may increase the

malignant syndrome (NMS). See section 4 Possible side effects for the characteristics of NMS;

caused by injury.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Entacapone Teva: 
* if you have ever had a heart attack or any other diseases of the heart; 
* if you are taking a medicine which may cause dizziness or light-headedness (low blood 
pressure) when rising from a chair or bed;<br />
* if you experience prolonged diarrhoea consult your doctor as it may be a sign of inflammation 
of the colon; 
* if you experience diarrhoea, monitoring of your weight is recommended in order to avoid 
potentially excessive weight loss;  </p>
<ul>
<li>if you experience increasing loss of appetite, weakness, exhaustion and weight loss within a 
relatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be 
considered.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in 
ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain 
activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and 
can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a 
preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your 
treatments. </p>
<p>As Entacapone Teva tablets will be taken together with other levodopa medicines, please also read the 
package leaflets of these medicines carefully. </p>
<p>The dose of other medicines to treat Parkinson s disease may need to be adjusted when you start 
taking Entacapone Teva. Follow the instructions that your doctor has given you. </p>
<p>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a serious but rare reaction to certain medicines, and may 
occur especially when Entacapone Teva and other medicines to treat Parkinson s disease are suddenly 
stopped or the dose is suddenly reduced. For the characteristics of NMS see Section 4 Possible side 
effects. Your doctor may advise you to slowly discontinue the treatment with Entacapone Teva and 
other medicines to treat Parkinson s disease. </p>
<p>Entacapone Teva taken with levodopa may cause drowsiness and may cause you to sometimes 
suddenly fall asleep. If this happens, you should not drive or use any tools or machines (see Driving 
and using machines).  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Entacapone Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular please tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: 
* rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, 
apomorphine;<br />
<em> antidepressants including desipramine, maprotiline, venlafaxine, paroxetine;<br />
</em> warfarin used to thin the blood; 
* iron supplements. Entacapone Teva may make it harder for you to digest iron. Therefore, do 
not take Entacapone Teva and iron supplements at the same time. After taking one of them, 
wait at least 2 to 3 hours before taking the other. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Do not use Entacapone Teva during pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding.<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Entacapone Teva taken together with levodopa may lower your blood pressure, which may make you 
feel light-headed or dizzy. Be particularly careful when you drive or when you use tools or machinery.  </p>
<p>In addition, Entacapone Teva taken with levodopa may make you feel very drowsy, or cause you to 
sometimes find yourself suddenly fall asleep. 
Do not drive or operate machinery if you experience these side effects. </p>         </div>"""
