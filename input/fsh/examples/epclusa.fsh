(listed in section 6 of this leaflet). </p>
<p>If this applies to you, do not take Epclusa and tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: </li>
<li>rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); </li>
<li>St. John s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor if you: 
* have liver problems other than from hepatitis C, for instance 
* if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely; 
* if you have had a liver transplant 
* have kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Epclusa has not been fully 
tested in patients with some severe kidney problems; 
* are taking treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Epclusa if: 
* you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat 
irregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor 
may consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Epclusa is 
needed, you may require additional heart monitoring. 
* you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or 
adjustment of your diabetes medicines after starting Epclusa. Some diabetic patients have 
experienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with 
medicines like Epclusa. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months any medicines 
for heart problems and during treatment you experience: 
* slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; 
* shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; 
* chest pain; 
* light-headedness; 
* palpitations; 
* near fainting or fainting. </p>
<p>Blood tests 
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Epclusa. This is so that: 
* Your doctor can decide if you should take Epclusa and for how long; 
* Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C 
virus. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Epclusa in patients under 
3 years of age has not been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Epclusa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists are used to thin the blood. Your 
doctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. </p>
<p>Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other 
medications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Epclusa. </p>
<p>If you are not sure talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Some medicines should not be taken with Epclusa. </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take with any other medicine that contains sofosbuvir, one of the active substances 
in Epclusa. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: </p>
<ul>
<li>amiodarone used to treat irregular heartbeats; </li>
<li>rifapentine (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); </li>
<li>oxcarbazepine (medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); </li>
<li>tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, used 
to treat HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B; </li>
<li>efavirenz used to treat HIV infection; </li>
<li>digoxin used to treat heart conditions; </li>
<li>dabigatran used to thin the blood; </li>
<li>modafinil used to treat sleep disorders; </li>
<li>rosuvastatin or other statins used to treat high cholesterol. </li>
</ul>
<p>Taking Epclusa with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side 
effects worse. Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine 
you are taking. This change could be to Epclusa or another medicine you are taking. </p>
<ul>
<li>Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, 
heartburn or acid reflux as they can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood. These 
medicines include: </li>
<li>antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate). These should 
be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Epclusa; </li>
<li>proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and 
esomeprazole). Epclusa should be taken with food 4 hours before using a proton pump 
inhibitor. </li>
<li>H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). If you 
need high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a different medicine instead 
or adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking. 
These medicines can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood. If you are taking one of these 
medicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid 
reflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and contraception 
The effects of Epclusa during pregnancy are not known. If you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Epclusa is sometimes used together with ribavirin. Ribavirin can harm your unborn baby. It is 
therefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this treatment or for 
a period of time after completing treatment. You must read the  Pregnancy  section in the ribavirin 
package leaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for effective contraception method suitable for you and 
your partner. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Epclusa. It is not known whether sofosbuvir or 
velpatasvir, the two active substances of Epclusa, pass into human breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Epclusa should not affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machinery. </p>
<p>Epclusa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
