  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Epoetin alfa HEXAL contains the active substance epoetin alfa, a protein that stimulates the bone 
marrow to produce more red blood cells which carry haemoglobin (a substance that transports 
oxygen). Epoetin alfa is a copy of the human protein erythropoietin (ee-rith-roe-po-eh-tin) and acts in 
the same way.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is used to treat symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease:</p>
<p>in children on haemodialysis</p>
<p>in adults on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis</p>
<p>in severely anaemic adults not yet undergoing dialysis 
If you have kidney disease, you may be short of red blood cells if your kidney does not produce 
enough erythropoietin (necessary for red cell production). Epoetin alfa HEXAL is prescribed to 
stimulate your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is used to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid 
tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) who may have a need for 
a blood transfusion. Epoetin alfa HEXAL can reduce the need for a blood transfusion in these patients.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is used in moderately anaemic adults who donate some of their blood 
before surgery, so that it can be given back to them during or after the operation. Because Epoetin 
alfa HEXAL stimulates the production of red blood cells, doctors can take more blood from these 
people.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is used in moderately anaemic adults about to have major orthopaedic 
surgery (for example hip or knee replacement operations), to reduce the potential need for blood 
transfusions.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is used to treat anaemia in adults with a bone marrow disorder that causes 
a severe disruption in the creation of blood cells (myelodysplastic syndromes). Epoetin alfa 
HEXAL can reduce the need for a blood transfusion.</p>         </div>"""

<p>can t take medicines to thin the blood
Epoetin alfa HEXAL may not be suitable for you. Please discuss with your doctor. While on 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL, some people need medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots. If you 
can t take medicines that prevent blood clotting, you must not have Epoetin alfa HEXAL.
Warnings and precautions:
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Epoetin alfa HEXAL. 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL and other products that stimulate red cell production may increase the 
risk of developing blood clots in all patients. This risk may be higher if you have other risk 
factors for developing blood clots (for example, if you have had a blood clot in the past or are 
overweight, have diabetes, have heart disease or you are off your feet for a long time because of 
surgery or illness). Please tell your doctor about any of these things. Your doctor will help you to 
decide if Epoetin alfa HEXAL is suitable for you. 
It is important to tell your doctor if any of the following apply to you. You may still be able to use 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL, but discuss it with your doctor first.
If you know you suffer, or have suffered, from:</p>
<p>high blood pressure;</p>
<p>epileptic seizures or fits;</p>
<p>liver disease;</p>
<p>anaemia from other causes;</p>
<p>porphyria (a rare blood disorder).
If you are a cancer patient be aware that products that stimulate red blood cell production (like 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL) may act as a growth factor and therefore in theory may affect the progression of 
your cancer.
Depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss 
this with your doctor.
If you are a patient with hepatitis C and you receive interferon and ribavirin, you should discuss 
this with your doctor because a combination of epoetin alfa with interferon and ribavirin has led to a 
loss of effect and development of a condition called pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), a severe form of 
anaemia, in rare cases. Epoetin alfa HEXAL is not approved in the management of anaemia associated 
with hepatitis C.
If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL, your doctor will check your dose of Epoetin alfa HEXAL because repeatedly 
increasing your dose of Epoetin alfa HEXAL if you are not responding to treatment may increase the 
risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial 
infarction, stroke and death.
If you are a cancer patient, be aware that use of Epoetin alfa HEXAL may be associated with shorter 
survival and a higher death rate in head and neck, and metastatic breast cancer patients who are 
receiving chemotherapy. 
Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production:
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like 
the human protein erythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional will always record the exact 
product you are using. If you are given a product in this group other than Epoetin alfa HEXAL during 
your treatment, speak to your doctor or pharmacist before using it.
Take special care with Epoetin alfa HEXAL:
Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. 
SJS/TEN can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters 
on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. 
These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may 
progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications.
If you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking Epoetin alfa HEXAL and 
contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.
Other medicines and Epoetin alfa HEXAL
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
If you are taking a medicine called cyclosporin (used e.g. after kidney transplants), your doctor may 
order blood tests to check the level of cyclosporin while you are taking Epoetin alfa HEXAL.
Iron supplements and other blood stimulants may increase the effectiveness of Epoetin alfa 
HEXAL. Your doctor will decide if it is right for you to take them.
If you visit a hospital, clinic or family doctor, tell them you are having Epoetin alfa HEXAL 
treatment. It may affect other treatments or test results.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is important to tell your doctor if any of the following apply to you. You may still be able to use 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL, but discuss it with your doctor first:</p>
<p>if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant.</p>
<p>if you are breast-feeding.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL contains sodium
Epoetin alfa HEXAL contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
 sodium free .</p>         </div>"""

not sure. 
Your doctor has carried out blood tests and decided you need Epoetin alfa HEXAL. 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL may be given by injection:</p>
<p>Either into a vein or a tube that goes into a vein (intravenously)</p>
<p>Or under the skin (subcutaneously).
Your doctor will decide how Epoetin alfa HEXAL will be injected. Usually the injections will be 
given to you by a doctor, nurse or other health care professional. Some people, depending on why they 
need Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment, may later learn how to inject themselves under the skin: see 
Instructions on how to inject Epoetin alfa HEXAL yourself at the end of the leaflet.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL should not be used:</p>
<p>after the expiry date on the label and outer carton</p>
<p>if you know, or think that it may have been accidentally frozen, or </p>
<p>if there has been a refrigerator failure.
The dose of Epoetin alfa HEXAL you receive is based on your body weight in kilograms. The cause 
of your anaemia is also a factor in your doctor deciding the correct dose.
Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Epoetin alfa HEXAL.
People with kidney disease</p>
<p>Your doctor will maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL as a high 
haemoglobin level may increase the risk of blood clots and death. In children the haemoglobin 
level should be maintained between 9.5 and 11 g/dL.</p>
<p>The usual starting dose of Epoetin alfa HEXAL for adults and children is 50 International 
Units (IU) per kilogram (/kg) of body weight given three times a week. For patients on 
peritoneal dialysis Epoetin alfa HEXAL may be given twice a week.</p>
<p>For adults and children Epoetin alfa HEXAL is given as an injection either into a vein 
(intravenously) or a tube that goes into a vein. When this access (via a vein or tube) is not 
readily available, your doctor may decide that Epoetin alfa HEXAL should be injected under the 
skin (subcutaneously). This includes patients on dialysis and patients not yet on dialysis.</p>
<p>Your doctor will order regular blood tests to see how your anaemia is responding and may 
adjust the dose, usually no more frequently than every four weeks. A rise in haemoglobin of 
greater than 2 g/dL over a four week period should be avoided. </p>
<p>Once your anaemia has been corrected, your doctor will continue to check your blood regularly. 
Your Epoetin alfa HEXAL dose and frequency of administration may be further adjusted to 
maintain your response to treatment. Your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control 
the symptoms of your anaemia.</p>
<p>If you do not respond adequately to Epoetin alfa HEXAL, your doctor will check your dose and 
will inform you if you need to change doses of Epoetin alfa HEXAL.</p>
<p>If you are on a more extended dosing interval (greater than once weekly) of Epoetin alfa 
HEXAL, you may not maintain adequate haemoglobin levels and you may require an increase 
in Epoetin alfa HEXAL dose or frequency of administration.</p>
<p>You may be given iron supplements before and during Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment to make 
it more effective.</p>
<p>If you are having dialysis treatment when you begin treatment with Epoetin alfa HEXAL, your 
dialysis regime may need to be adjusted. Your doctor will decide this.
Adults on chemotherapy</p>
<p>Your doctor may initiate treatment with Epoetin alfa HEXAL if your haemoglobin is 10 g/dL or 
less.</p>
<p>Your doctor will maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL as a high 
haemoglobin level may increase the risk of blood clots and death.</p>
<p>The starting dose is either 150 IU per kilogram body weight three times a week or 450 IU per 
kilogram body weight once a week.</p>
<p>Epoetin alfa HEXAL is given by injection under the skin. </p>
<p>Your doctor will order blood tests, and may adjust the dose, depending on how your anaemia 
responds to Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment. </p>
<p>You may be given iron supplements before and during Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment to make 
it more effective.</p>
<p>You will usually continue Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment for one month after the end of 
chemotherapy.
Adults donating their own blood</p>
<p>The usual dose is 600 IU per kilogram body weight twice a week.</p>
<p>Epoetin alfa HEXAL is given by injection into a vein immediately after you have donated blood 
for 3 weeks before your surgery. </p>
<p>You may be given iron supplements before and during Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment to make 
it more effective.
Adults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery</p>
<p>The recommended dose is 600 IU per kilogram body weight once a week.</p>
<p>Epoetin alfa HEXAL is given by injection under the skin each week for three weeks before 
surgery and on the day of surgery.</p>
<p>If there is a medical need to reduce the time before your operation, you will be given a daily 
dose of 300 IU/kg for up to ten days before surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days 
immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>If blood tests show your haemoglobin is too high before the operation, the treatment will be 
stopped. </p>
<p>You may be given iron supplements before and during Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment to make 
it more effective.
Adults with myelodysplastic syndrome</p>
<p>Your doctor may initiate treatment with Epoetin alfa HEXAL if your haemoglobin is 10 g/dL or 
less. The aim of treatment is to maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL as a 
higher haemoglobin level may increase the risk of blood clots and death.</p>
<p>Epoetin alfa HEXAL is given by injection under the skin.</p>
<p>The starting dose is 450 IU per kilogram bodyweight once a week.</p>
<p>Your doctor will order blood tests, and may adjust the dose, depending on how your anaemia 
responds to Epoetin alfa HEXAL treatment.
Instructions on how to inject Epoetin alfa HEXAL yourself 
When treatment starts, Epoetin alfa HEXAL is usually injected by a medical professional or a nurse. 
Later, your doctor may suggest that you or your caregiver learn how to inject Epoetin alfa HEXAL 
under the skin (subcutaneously) yourself.</p>
<p>Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so by your doctor or 
nurse.</p>
<p>Always use Epoetin alfa HEXAL exactly as instructed by your doctor or nurse.</p>
<p>Ensure that you only inject the amount of liquid as instructed by your doctor or nurse.</p>
<p>Only use Epoetin alfa HEXAL if it has been stored correctly   see section 5, How to store 
Epoetin alfa HEXAL.</p>
<p>Before use, leave the Epoetin alfa HEXAL syringe to stand until it reaches room 
temperature. This usually takes between 15 and 30 minutes. Use the syringe within 3 days 
of taking it out of the refrigerator. 
Only take one dose of Epoetin alfa HEXAL from each syringe.
If Epoetin alfa HEXAL is injected under the skin (subcutaneously), the amount injected is not 
normally more than one millilitre (1 mL) in a single injection.
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is given alone and not mixed with other liquids for injection.
Do not shake Epoetin alfa HEXAL syringes. Prolonged vigorous shaking may damage the product. 
If the product has been shaken vigorously, don t use it.
Instructions on how to inject yourself with Epoetin alfa HEXAL can be found at the end of this leaflet.
If you use more Epoetin alfa HEXAL than you should
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you think too much Epoetin alfa HEXAL has been injected. 
Side effects from an overdose of Epoetin alfa HEXAL are unlikely.
If you forget to use Epoetin alfa HEXAL
Make the next injection as soon as you remember. If you are within a day of your next injection, forget 
the missed one and carry on with your normal schedule. Do not double up the injections to make up 
for a forgotten dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

Common side effects
These may affect up to 1 in 10 people.</p>
<p>Increased blood pressure. Headaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches, 
feeling confused or having fits may be signs of a sudden increase in blood pressure. This 
requires urgent treatment. Raised blood pressure may require treatment with medicines (or 
adjustment to any medicines you already take for high blood pressure).</p>
<p>Blood clots (including deep vein thrombosis and embolism) that may require urgent treatment. 
You may have chest pain, breathlessness, and painful swelling and redness, usually in the

<p>Cough.</p>
<p>Skin rashes, which may result from an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Bone or muscle pain.</p>
<p>Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, aches and pains in the joints, feeling of weakness, chills, 
tiredness and dizziness. These may be more common at the start of treatment. If you have these 
symptoms during injection into the vein, a slower delivery of the injection may help to avoid 
them in the future.</p>
<p>Redness, burning and pain at the site of injection.</p>
<p>Swelling of the ankles, feet or fingers.</p>
<p>Arm or leg pain.
Uncommon side effects

<p>High levels of blood potassium which can cause abnormal heart rhythm (this is a very common 
side effect in patients on dialysis). </p>
<p>Fits.</p>
<p>Nose or airway congestion.</p>
<p>Allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Hives.
Rare side effects
These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Symptoms of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA)
PRCA means the bone marrow does not make enough red blood cells. PRCA causes sudden and 
severe anaemia. The symptoms are:</p>
<p>unusual tiredness,</p>
<p>feeling dizzy,</p>
<p>breathlessness.
PRCA has been very rarely reported mostly in patients with kidney disease after months to years of 
treatment with epoetin alfa and other products that stimulate red blood cell production.</p>
<p>An increase in levels of small blood cells (called platelets), which are normally involved in the 
formation of a blood clot may occur, particularly when starting treatment. Your doctor will 
check on this.</p>
<p>Severe allergic reaction that may include:</p>
<p>a swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat,</p>
<p>difficulty swallowing or breathing,</p>
<p>itchy rash (hives).</p>
<p>Problem with the blood that may cause pain, dark coloured urine or increased sensitivity of the 
skin to sunlight (porphyria).
If you are receiving haemodialysis:</p>
<p>Blood clots (thrombosis) may form in your dialysis shunt. This is more likely if you have low 
blood pressure or if your fistula has complications.</p>
<p>Blood clots may also form in your haemodialysis system. Your doctor may decide to increase 
your heparin dose during dialysis.
Serious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been 
reported in association with epoetin treatment. These can appear as reddish target-like macules or 
circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, 
genitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. Stop using Epoetin alfa 
HEXAL if you develop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical attention 
immediately. See also section 2. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are aware of any of these effects, or if you notice any 
other effects while you are receiving treatment with Epoetin alfa HEXAL. 
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please 
tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side
