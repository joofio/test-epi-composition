Erleada is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance  apalutamide .
What Erleada is used for
It is used to treat adult men with prostate cancer that:</p>
<p>has metastasised to other parts of the body and still responds to medical or surgical treatments 
that lower testosterone (also called hormone-sensitive prostate cancer).</p>
<p>has not metastasised to other parts of the body and no longer responds to medical or surgical 
treatment that lowers testosterone (also called castration-resistant prostate cancer).
How Erleada works
Erleada works by blocking the activity of hormones called androgens (such as testosterone). 
Androgens can cause the cancer to grow. By blocking the effect of androgens, apalutamide stops 
prostate cancer cells from growing and dividing.</p>         </div>"""

<p>you have any heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia).</p>
<p>you have ever had a widespread rash, high body temperature and enlarged lymph nodes (drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or DRESS) or a severe skin rash or skin 
peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis or 
SJS/TEN) after taking Erleada or other related medicines.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking

people during treatment with Erleada.
Your healthcare provider will monitor you for signs and symptoms of heart or brain problems during 
your treatment with this medicine.
Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room right away if you get:</p>
<p>chest pain or discomfort at rest or with activity, or</p>
<p>shortness of breath, or</p>
<p>muscle weakness/paralysis in any part of the body, or</p>
<p>difficulty in speaking.
If you are taking any medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist to see if they are associated with an 
increased risk of seizure, bleeding or heart condition.
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs)
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs), including drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms (DRESS) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN),
have been reported with the use of Erleada. DRESS can appear as widespread rash, high body 
temperature and enlarged lymph nodes. SJS/TEN can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or 
circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals 
and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever 
and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and 
life-threatening complications or be fatal.
If you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking this medicine and contact 
your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
this medicine. See section 4  Serious side effects  at the top of section 4 for more information.
Interstitial Lung Disease
Cases of interstitial lung disease (non-infectious inflammation within the lungs that may lead to 
permanent damage) have been observed in patients taking Erleada, including fatal cases. The 
symptoms of interstitial lung disease are cough and shortness of breath sometimes with fever which 
are not caused by physical activity. Seek immediate medical attention, if you experience symptoms 
that may be signs of interstitial lung disease.
