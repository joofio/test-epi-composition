of uterine fibroids (commonly known as myomas), which are non-cancerous tumours of the uterus 
(womb).<br />
Esmya is used in adult women (over 18 years of age) before they reach the menopause. </p>
<p>In some women, uterine fibroids may cause heavy menstrual bleeding (your  period ), pelvic pain 
(discomfort in the belly) and create pressure on other organs. </p>
<p>This medicine acts by modifying the activity of progesterone, a naturally occuring hormone in the 
body. It is used for long term treatment of your fibroids to reduce their size, to stop or reduce bleeding 
and to increase your red blood cell count. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You should know that most women have no menstrual bleeding (period) during the treatment and for a 
few weeks afterwards.  </p>
<p>Do not take Esmya 
- if you are allergic to ulipristal acetate or any of the other ingredients of Esmya (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have an underlying hepatic disorder. 
- if you are pregnant or if you are breastfeeding. 
- if you have vaginal bleeding not caused by uterine fibroids. 
- if you have cancer of the uterus (womb), cervix (the neck of the womb), ovary or breast. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
- Before you start treatment with Esmya blood tests will be undertaken to find out how well your 
liver is working. Depending on the result of these tests your doctor will decide if treatment with 
Esmya is suitable for you. These tests will be repeated monthly for the first 2 treatment courses. 
For further treatment courses, your liver will be checked once before each new treatment course 
and if you experience any of the symptoms described below. In addition, an additional check of 
your liver 2-4 weeks after your treatment has stopped should be done.<br />
If during the treatment you experience any liver related signs such as feeling of being sick 
(nausea or vomiting), fatigue, severe tiredness, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes or skin), dark 
urine, itching or upper stomach ache, you should stop treatment and immediately contact a 
doctor, who will check the functioning of your liver and decide if you can continue the 
treatment. 
- If you are currently taking hormonal contraception (for example birth control pills) (see  Other 
medicines and Esmya ) you should use an alternative reliable barrier contraceptive method 
(such as a condom) while taking Esmya. 
- If you have liver or kidney disease tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Esmya. 
- If you suffer from severe asthma, treatment with Esmya may not be suitable for you. You 
should discuss this with your doctor. </p>
<p>Treatment with Esmya usually leads to a significant reduction or may even stop your menstrual 
bleeding (your  period ) within the first 10 days of treatment. However, if you continue to experience 
excessive bleeding tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Your period should generally return within 4 weeks after treatment with Esmya is stopped. The lining 
of the uterus may thicken or change as a result of taking Esmya. These changes return to normal after 
treatment is stopped and your periods restart. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Esmya should not be taken by children under 18 years of age since safety and efficacy of ulipristal 
acetate has not been established in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Esmya 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as these medicines 
can affect Esmya or be affected by Esmya:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain medicines which are used to treat the heart (e.g. digoxin). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to prevent strokes and blood clots (e.g. dabigatran etexilate). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat epilepsy (e.g. phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, 
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, primidone). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat HIV infection (e.g. ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine). </li>
<li>Medicines used to treat certain bacterial infections (e.g. rifampicin, telithromycin, 
clarithromycin, erythromycin, rifabutin). </li>
<li>Certain medicines to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole (except shampoo), itraconazole). </li>
<li>Herbal remedies containing St John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) used for depression or 
anxiety. </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat depression (e.g. nefazodone). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat hypertension (e.g. verapamil). </li>
</ul>
<p>Esmya is likely to make some hormonal contraceptives less effective. In addition, hormonal 
contraceptives and progestagens (e.g. norethindrone or levonorgestrel) are also likely to make Esmya 
less effective. Therefore, hormonal contraceptives are not recommended and you should use an 
alternative reliable barrier contraceptive method, such as a condom, during Esmya treatment. </p>
<p>Esmya with food and drink 
You should avoid drinking grapefruit juice while on treatment with Esmya. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Do not take Esmya if you are pregnant. Treatment whilst pregnant might affect your pregnancy (it is 
not known if Esmya might harm your baby or whether can cause miscarriage). If you do become 
pregnant during Esmya treatment, you should stop taking Esmya immediately and contact your doctor 
or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Esmya is likely to make some hormonal contraceptives less effective (see  Other medicines and 
Esmya ). 
Esmya passes into the breast milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed your baby while taking Esmya. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Esmya may cause mild dizziness (see section 4  Possible side effects ). Do not drive or use machines 
if you experience these symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

The recommended dose is one 5 mg tablet per day, for treatment courses of up to 3 months each. If 
you have been prescribed several courses of Esmya 3-month treatment, you should start each course at 
the earliest during the second menstrual period following the previous treatment completion. 
You should always start taking Esmya within the first week of your menstrual period. 
The tablet should be swallowed with water and may be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more Esmya than you should 
Experience with Esmya when several doses are taken at once is limited. There have been no reports of 
serious harmful effects from taking several doses of this medicine at once. You should nonetheless ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you take more Esmya than you should. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Esmya 
If you miss a dose by less than 12 hours, take it as soon as you remember. If you miss a dose by more 
than 12 hours, skip the missed tablet and take only a single tablet as usual. Do not take a double dose 
to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Esmya 
Esmya is to be taken daily during treatment courses of up to 3 months continuously. During each 
course of treatment, do not stop taking your tablets without the advice of your doctor even if you feel 
better, as symptoms may re-occur later. </p>
