Esperoct contains the active substance turoctocog alfa pegol and is a long-acting recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII product. Factor VIII is a protein found in the blood that helps to prevent and 
stop bleeding. </p>
<p>What Esperoct is used for 
Esperoct is used to treat and prevent bleeding in people 12 years and above with haemophilia A 
(inborn factor VIII deficiency). </p>
<p>In people with haemophilia A, factor VIII is missing or does not work properly. Esperoct replaces this 
faulty or missing factor VIII and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to hamster proteins. </p>
<p>Do not use Esperoct if either of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Previous use of factor VIII medicine<br />
Tell your doctor if you have used factor VIII medicines before, especially if you developed inhibitors 
(antibodies) against the medicine, since there might be a risk that it happens again. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
There is a risk that you may experience a severe and sudden allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactic 
reaction) to Esperoct. </p>
<p>Stop the injection and contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have early signs of 
allergic reactions. These early signs may include rash, hives, weals, itching on large areas of skin, 
redness and/or swelling of lips, tongue, face or hands, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, wheezing, 
tightness of the chest, pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, or dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting. </p>
<p>Development of  factor VIII inhibitors  (antibodies) 
Inhibitors (antibodies) can develop during the treatment with all factor VIII medicines 
* These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly 
* You will be monitored carefully for development of these inhibitors 
* If your bleeding is not being controlled with Esperoct, tell your doctor immediately 
* Do not increase the total dose of Esperoct to control your bleed without talking to your doctor. </p>
<p>Catheter-related problems 
If you have a catheter where medicines can be injected into your blood (central venous access device), 
you may develop infections or blood clots at the site of the catheter. </p>
<p>Heart disease 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have heart disease or you are at risk of heart disease. </p>
<p>Children 
Esperoct can not be used in children below 12 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Esperoct 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Esperoct has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Esperoct contains sodium 
This medicine contains 30.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per reconstituted vial. 
This is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>Decreased factor VIII activity in previously treated patients 
A decreased factor VIII activity may occur in the beginning of your treatment. If you think your 
medicine works less than expected, tell your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

haemophilia A. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure about how to use Esperoct. </p>
<p>How Esperoct is given 
Esperoct is given as an injection into a vein (intravenously), see  Instructions on how to use Esperoct<br />
for more information. </p>
<p>How much to use 
Your doctor will calculate your dose for you. This will depend on your body weight and whether it is 
used to prevent or to treat a bleeding. </p>
<p>To prevent bleeding 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and above): The recommended dose is 50 IU of Esperoct per 
kg body weight every 4 days. Your doctor may choose another dose or how often the injections should 
be given, based on your need. </p>
<p>To treat bleeding 
The dose of Esperoct is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. If you 
experience that the effect of Esperoct is insufficient, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Adolescents (12 years of age and above) can use the same dose as adults. </p>
<p>If you use more Esperoct than you should 
If you use more Esperoct than you should, contact your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>If you have to significantly increase your usage of Esperoct to stop a bleed, talk to your doctor 
immediately. For further information, see  Development of  factor VIII inhibitors  (antibodies)  in 
section 2. If you forget to use Esperoct 
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do not inject a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as scheduled and continue as advised by 
your doctor. If you are in doubt, contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop using Esperoct 
Do not stop using Esperoct without talking to your doctor. 
If you stop using Esperoct, you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not 
stop. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

Development of  factor VIII inhibitors  (antibodies) 
If you have previously received more than 150 days of treatment with factor VIII, inhibitors 
(antibodies) may develop (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If this happens, your medicine may stop 
working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact 
your doctor immediately. See  Development of  factor VIII inhibitors  (antibodies)  in section 2. The following side effects have been observed with Esperoct </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than up to 1 in 10 people) 
* factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies) in patients not previously treated with factor VIII. </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* skin reactions where the injection is given 
* itching (pruritus) 
* redness of skin (erythema) 
* rash. </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* allergic reactions (hypersensitivity). These may become severe and could be life-threatening, see 
 Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)  above for more information
