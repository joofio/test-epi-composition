Evkeeza contains the active substance evinacumab. It is a type of medicine called a  monoclonal 
antibody . Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that attach to other substances in the body. </p>
<p>What Evkeeza is used for 
Evkeeza is used to treat adults and children aged 5 years and older with very high cholesterol caused 
by a condition called  homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia . Evkeeza is used with a low-fat 
diet and other medicines to bring down cholesterol levels. </p>
<p>Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia runs in families and it is usually passed down by both 
father and mother. </p>
<p>People with this condition have extremely high levels of LDL-cholesterol ( bad cholesterol ) from 
birth. Such high levels can lead to heart attacks, heart valve disease or other problems at an early age. </p>
<p>How does Evkeeza work? 
Evinacumab, the active substance in Evkeeza, attaches to a protein in the body called ANGPTL3 and 
blocks its effects. ANGPTL3 is involved in controlling the production of cholesterol, and blocking its 
effect reduces the production of cholesterol. In this way, Evkeeza can lower blood levels of 
LDL-cholesterol and so prevent problems caused by high LDL-cholesterol levels. </p>         </div>"""
