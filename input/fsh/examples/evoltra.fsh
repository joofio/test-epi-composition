kills them. It works best against cells which are multiplying quickly   such as cancer cells. </p>
<p>Evoltra is used to treat children (  1 year old), teenagers and young adults up to 21 years old with 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when previous treatments have not worked or have stopped 
working. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by abnormal growth of some types of white blood

- if you are allergic to clofarabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
- if you are breast-feeding (please read the section  Pregnancy and breast-feeding  below); 
- if you have severe kidney or liver problems. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you.  If you are the parent of a child who is 
being treated with Evoltra, tell the doctor if any of them apply to your child. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  Evoltra may not be suitable for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have suffered a severe reaction after previously using this medicine; </li>
<li>if you have kidney disease, or used to have it; </li>
<li>if you have liver disease, or used to have it; </li>
<li>if you have heart disease, or used to have it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or carer immediately if you experience any of the following as you may need to 
stop treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you get a fever or high temperature   because clofarabine reduces the number of blood cells 
made in the bone marrow, you may be more likely to catch infections; </li>
<li>if you have breathing difficulties, rapid breathing, or breathlessness; </li>
<li>if you feel a change in your heart rate; </li>
<li>if you suffer from dizziness (light-headedness) or fainting   it may be a symptom of low blood 
pressure; </li>
<li>if you feel sick or have diarrhoea (loose bowels); </li>
<li>if your urine is darker than usual   it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration; </li>
<li>if you get a rash with blisters or mouth ulcers;  </li>
<li>if you lose your appetite, have nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhea, dark-colored urine and 
light-coloured stools, stomach pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), or if you feel 
generally unwell, these could be symptoms of an inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), or liver 
damage (hepatic failure); </li>
<li>if you pass little or no urine, or experience drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, loss of 
appetite and / or weakness (these may be signs of acute kidney failure / kidney failure).  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Evoltra, tell the doctor if any of the above 
conditions apply to your child. </p>
<p>During treatment with Evoltra, your doctor will carry out regular blood tests and other tests to 
monitor your health.  Because of the way this medicine works, it will affect your blood and other 
organs. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about contraception.  Young men and women must use effective contraception 
during and after treatment.  See the section  Pregnancy and breast-feeding  below.  Evoltra may harm 
both male and female reproductive organs.  Ask your doctor to explain what can be done to protect 
you or allow you to have a family. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Evoltra 
Tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines for heart disease; </li>
<li>any medicine that changes your blood pressure; </li>
<li>medicines that affect your liver or kidneys; </li>
<li>any other medicines including those obtained without a prescription. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Clofarabine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Women who are able to get pregnant: you must use effective contraception during treatment with 
clofarabine and for 6 months following completion of treatment. Clofarabine may cause harm to 
unborn babies when used by pregnant women.  If you are pregnant or you become pregnant during 
treatment with clofarabine, get medical advice immediately. </p>
<p>Men must also use effective contraception and be advised to not father a child while receiving 
clofarabine, and for 3 months following completion of treatment. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, you must stop breast-feeding before starting the treatment, and must not 
breast-feed during your treatment and within 2 weeks after completion of your treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy, light-headed or faint. </p>
<p>Evoltra contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains 72 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 3.6 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Talk to 
your pharmacist or doctor if you need 5 or more vials daily during your treatment cycle for a 
prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet. </p>         </div>"""

<p>This medicine has been authorised under  Exceptional Circumstances .  This means that because of 
the rarity of this disease it has been impossible to get complete information on this medicine. The 
European Medicines Agency will review any new information on the medicine every year and this 
leaflet will be updated as necessary. </p>
<p>Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency  web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ and on the website of {name of Member State Agency (link)}&gt;. There are 
also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. </p>
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Special precautions for administration 
Evoltra 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion must be diluted prior to administration. It should 
be filtered through a sterile 0.2 micrometre syringe filter and then diluted with sodium chloride 9 
mg/ml (0.9%) intravenous infusion to produce a total volume according to the examples given in the 
table below. However, the final dilution volume may vary depending on the patient s clinical status 
and physician discretion. (If the use of a 0.2 micrometre syringe filter is not feasible, the concentrate 
should be pre-filtered with a 5 micrometre filter, diluted and then administered through a 0.micrometre inline filter.) </p>
<p>Suggested dilution schedule based on the recommended dosage of 52 mg/m2/day clofarabine 
Body surface area (m2) 
Concentrate (ml)<em> 
Total diluted volume 
  1.  74.9 
100 ml 
1.45 to 2.75.4 to 124.8 
150 ml 
2.41 to 2.125.3 to 130.0 
200 ml 
</em>Each ml of concentrate contains 1 mg of clofarabine. Each 20 ml vial contains 20 mg of clofarabine. 
Therefore, for patients with a body surface area   0.38 m2, the partial contents of a single vial will be 
required to produce the recommended daily dosage of clofarabine. However, for patients with a body 
surface area &gt; 0.38 m2, the contents of between 1 to 7 vials will be required to produce the 
recommended daily dosage of clofarabine. </p>
<p>The diluted concentrate should be a clear, colourless solution. It should be visually inspected for 
particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. </p>
<p>The diluted concentrate is chemically and physically stable for 3 days at 2 C to 8 C and at room 
temperature (up to 25 C). From a microbiological point of view, it should be used immediately. If not 
used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 C to 8 C unless dilution has taken place under 
controlled and validated aseptic conditions. Do not freeze. </p>
<p>Instructions for handling </p>
<p>Procedures for proper handling of antineoplastic agents should be observed. Cytotoxic medicinal 
products should be handled with caution. </p>
<p>The use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended when handling Evoltra. If the 
product comes into contact with eyes, skin or mucous membranes, rinse immediately with copious 
amounts of water. 
Evoltra should not be handled by pregnant women. </p>
<p>Disposal </p>
<p>Evoltra is for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of 
in accordance with local requirements. </p>         </div>"""
