<p>Evrysdi is a medicine that contains the active substance risdiplam. </p>
<p>What is Evrysdi used for </p>
<p>Evrysdi is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disease. </p>
<p>What spinal muscular atrophy is </p>
<p>SMA is caused by a shortage of a protein called survival motor neuron (SMN) protein in the body. 
Lack of SMN protein can cause you or your child to lose motor neurons, which are nerve cells that 
control muscles. This leads to muscle weakness and wasting that can affect everyday movements such 
as head and neck control, sitting, crawling and walking. The muscles used for breathing and 
swallowing may also become weaker. </p>
<p>How Evrysdi works </p>
<p>Risdiplam, the active substance in Evrysdi, works by helping the body produce more SMN protein. 
This means fewer motor neurons are lost, which may improve how well muscles work in people with 
SMA. </p>
<p>In infants with SMA Type 1 treated in clinical trials for 1 year, Evrysdi has helped to: </p>
<ul>
<li>increase how long they live and reduce the need for a ventilator to help with breathing compared 
to untreated infants with SMA (only 25% of untreated infants would be expected to be alive 
without the need for permanent ventilation beyond 14 months of age compared to 85% of 
patients after 1 year of treatment with Evrysdi), </li>
<li>keep the ability to be fed by mouth in 83% of patients. </li>
</ul>
<p>In children (toddlers to adolescents) and adults with SMA Type 2 and 3, Evrysdi may maintain or 
improve muscle control. </p>         </div>"""

* if you or your child are allergic to risdiplam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you or your child take Evrysdi. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you or your child take Evrysdi. </p>
<p>Treatment with Evrysdi may harm your unborn baby or may affect male fertility. See  Pregnancy, 
contraception, breast-feeding and male fertility  for more information. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Evrysdi </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines in the future. </p>
<p>In particular tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have received in the past any of 
the following medicines: 
* metformin   a medicine used to treat type II diabetes 
* medicines for the treatment of SMA </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception, breast-feeding and male fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take Evrysdi if you are pregnant. This is because taking this medicine while you are 
pregnant could harm your unborn baby. </li>
<li>Before you start treatment with Evrysdi, your doctor should do a pregnancy test. This is because 
Evrysdi may harm your unborn baby. </li>
<li>If you do become pregnant during your treatment with Evrysdi, tell your doctor straight away. </li>
</ul>
<p>You and your doctor will decide what is best for you and your unborn baby. </p>
<p>Contraception </p>
<p>For women </p>
<p>Do not become pregnant: 
* during your treatment with Evrysdi and 
* for one month after you stop taking Evrysdi. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about reliable methods of birth control that should be used during treatment and 
for one month after you stop treatment. </p>
<p>For men </p>
<p>If your female partner is of childbearing potential, you need to avoid pregnancy. Use reliable methods 
of birth control (eg. condoms): 
* during your treatment with Evrysdi and 
* for 4 months after you stop taking Evrysdi. </p>
<p>Talk to your healthcare provider about reliable methods of birth control that should be used. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine. This is because Evrysdi may pass into breast milk and 
may, therefore, harm your baby. </p>
<p>Discuss with your doctor if you should stop breast-feeding or if you should stop taking Evrysdi. </p>
<p>Male fertility </p>
<p>Based on findings in animals, Evrysdi may reduce male fertility while on treatment and for up to 4 
months after your last dose.  If you are planning to have a child, ask your doctor for advice. 
Do not donate sperm during your treatment and for 4 months after your last dose of Evrysdi. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Evrysdi is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Evrysdi contains sodium </p>
<p>Evrysdi contains a small amount of sodium (salt) - there is less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium even at 
the highest daily dose of 5 mg (6.6 mL of 0.75 mg/mL oral solution). This means it is essentially 
 sodium-free  and can be used by people on a sodium-restricted diet. </p>
<p>Evrysdi contains 0.375 mg of sodium benzoate per mL. Sodium benzoate may increase jaundice 
(yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old). </p>
<p>Evrysdi contains isomalt </p>
<p>Evrysdi contains 2.97 mg of isomalt per mL.  If you have been told by your doctor that you or your 
child have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>         </div>"""
