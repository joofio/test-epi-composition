Exviera works by stopping the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and infecting new cells, thus 
clearing the virus from your blood over a period of time.
Exviera tablets do not work on their own. They are always taken with another antiviral medicine
containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Some patients may also take an antiviral medicine called 
ribavirin. Your doctor will talk with you about which of these medicines to take with Exviera.
It is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other antiviral medicines that you 
take with Exviera. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or

your doctor can:</li>
</ul>
<p>Decide what other medicines you should take with Exviera and for how long.</p>
<p>Confirm if your treatment has worked and if you are free of the hepatitis C virus.</p>
<p>Check for side effects of Exviera or other antiviral medicines your doctor has prescribed for you to

Pregnancy and contraception 
The effects of Exviera during pregnancy are not known. Exviera should not be used during pregnancy 
or in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.</p>
<p>You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment. 
Contraceptive medicines that contains ethinyloestradiol cannot be used in combination with 
Exviera. Ask your doctor about the best contraception for you.
Extra precautions are needed if Exviera is taken together with ribavirin. Ribavirin may cause severe 
birth defects. Ribavirin stays for a long time in the body after treatment is stopped, and effective 
contraception is therefore needed both during treatment and for some time afterwards.
  There is a risk for birth defects when ribavirin is given to a female patient that becomes 
pregnant. 
  There may also be a risk for birth defects if ribavirin is taken by a male patient, whose female 
partner becomes pregnant. 
  Read the  Contraception  section of the package leaflet for ribavirin very carefully. It is 
important that both men and women read the information.
  If you or your partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Exviera and ribavirin or in the 
months that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately.
Breastfeeding
You should not breastfeed during treatment with Exviera. It is not known whether the active substance 
in Exviera (dasabuvir), passes into breast milk.
Driving and using machines
Some patients have reported feeling very tired when taking Exviera with other medicines for their 
hepatitis C infection. If you feel tired, do not drive or use any machines.
Exviera contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.</p>         </div>"""
