Eylea contains the active substance aflibercept. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularistion agents.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will inject Eylea into your eye to treat eye disorders in adults called:</p>
<ul>
<li>wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) </li>
<li>visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME). </li>
</ul>
<p>These disorders affect the macula. The macula is the central part of the light sensitive membrane at the 
back of the eye. It is responsible for clear vision. 
Wet AMD is caused when abnormal blood vessels form and grow below the macula. The abnormal 
blood vessels may leak fluid or blood into the eye. Leaky blood vessels that cause swelling of the 
macula cause DME. Both disorders may impact your vision. </p>
<p>How Eylea works 
Eylea stops growth of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye. Eylea can help to stabilise and often 
improve vision. </p>         </div>"""

- are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
- have an infection in or around the eye 
- have pain or redness in your eye (severe eye inflammation). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before receiving Eylea if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have glaucoma   an eye condition caused by high pressure in the eye </li>
<li>have a history of seeing flashes of light or dark floating spots and if their size or number 
suddenly increases </li>
<li>had eye surgery in the last 4 weeks or eye surgery is planned in the next 4 weeks. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you develop:</p>
<ul>
<li>redness of the eye  </li>
<li>eye pain </li>
<li>increased discomfort </li>
<li>blurred or decreased vision </li>
<li>increased sensitivity to light 
These may be symptoms of an inflammation or infection and your doctor may stop giving you Eylea. </li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, it is important for you to know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the safety and efficacy of Eylea when administered to both eyes at the same time have not been 
studied and such use may increase risk of experiencing side effects. </li>
<li>injections with Eylea may cause an increase in eye pressure in some patients within 60 minutes 
of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. </li>
<li>your doctor will check for other risk factors that may increase the chance of a tear or 
detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye. In such cases your doctor will give you 
Eylea with caution. </li>
<li>women who could become pregnant must use effective birth control during treatment and for at 
least 4 months after the last injection of Eylea. </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of substances similar to those contained in Eylea is potentially related to the risk of blood 
clots blocking blood vessels, which may lead to heart attack or stroke. Theoretically, this could also 
happen after an injection of Eylea into the eye. If you had a stroke, a mini-stroke or a heart attack 
within the last 6 months, your doctor will give you Eylea with caution.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of Eylea in children or adolescents under 18 has not been studied because the diseases 
indicated occur mainly in adults. Therefore, its use in this age group is not relevant. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Eylea 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
- Women who could become pregnant must use effective birth control during treatment and for at 
least 4 months after the last injection of Eylea. 
- There is no experience on the use of Eylea in pregnant women. Women should not receive 
Eylea during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the woman outweighs the potential risk to 
the unborn child. 
- Small amounts of Eylea may pass into human milk. The effect on breast-fed newborns/infants 
are unknown. Eylea is not recommended during breast-feeding. 
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
After receiving Eylea, you may experience some temporary vision problems. Do not drive or use 
machines as long as these last. </p>         </div>"""

<li>After that, you may receive injections up to every 5 months. Your doctor will decide on the 
frequency based on the condition of your eye. </li>
</ul>
<p>Method of administration 
Your doctor will inject Eylea into your eye (intravitreal injection). </p>
<p>Before the injection, your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent 
infection. Your doctor will give you an eye drop (local anaesthetic) to numb the eye to reduce or 
prevent pain from the injection. </p>
<p>If you missed a dose of Eylea 
Make a new appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Before stopping Eylea treatment 
Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. Stopping treatment may increase your risk of vision 
loss and your vision may worsen. </p>
