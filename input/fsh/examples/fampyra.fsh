potassium channel blockers. They work by stopping potassium leaving the nerve cells which have 
been damaged by MS. This medicine is thought to work by letting signals pass down the nerve more 
normally, which allows you to walk better. </p>
<p>Fampyra is a medicine used to improve walking in adults (18 years and over) with Multiple Sclerosis 
(MS) related walking disability. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective sheath 
around the nerves leading to muscle weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty walking. </p>         </div>"""
