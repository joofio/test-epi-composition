  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Fendrix is a vaccine which prevents hepatitis B.<br />
It is used for patients with kidney problems: 
* patients having  haemo-dialysis - where a  dialysis  machine removes waste products from the 
blood 
* patients who are going to have  haemo-dialysis  in the future. </p>
<p>Fendrix is for adults and young people aged 15 years and above. </p>
<p>What is hepatitis B? </p>
<p>Hepatitis B is caused by a virus which makes the liver swollen. <br />
* Signs may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. 
* The main signs of the illness include mild signs of flu such as headache or fever, feeling very 
tired, dark urine, pale stools (faeces), yellow skin or eyes (jaundice). These or other signs may 
mean the person might need treatment in hospital. Most people fully recover from the illness. 
* Some people with hepatitis B do not look or feel ill - they do not have any signs of illness. 
* The virus is found in body fluids such as in the vagina, blood, semen, or saliva (spit). </p>
<p>Carriers of hepatitis B </p>
<ul>
<li>The hepatitis B virus stays in the body of some people all through their lives. </li>
<li>This means they can still infect other people and are known as virus  carriers . </li>
<li>Carriers of the virus are likely to get serious liver problems, such as  cirrhosis  or liver cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p>How Fendrix works </p>
<ul>
<li>Fendrix helps your body to produce its own protection against the virus (antibodies). These 
antibodies will protect you against the disease. </li>
<li>Fendrix contains two things called  MPL  (a non-toxic purified fat derivative from bacteria) and 
 aluminium phosphate . These make the vaccine work quicker, better and last for longer. </li>
<li>As with all vaccines, a course of Fendrix cannot fully protect all people that are vaccinated. </li>
<li>Fendrix may not protect you from being ill if you have already caught the hepatitis B virus. </li>
<li>Fendrix can only help to protect you against infection with the hepatitis B virus. It cannot protect 
you against other infections that can affect the liver - even though these infections might have 
signs similar to those caused by the hepatitis B virus. </li>

<li>if you are allergic to the active substance, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed 
in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and 
swelling of the face or tongue </li>
<li>if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against hepatitis B </li>
<li>if you have a severe infection with a high temperature. The vaccine can be given after you have 
recovered. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor 
first. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fendrix should not be given if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before having Fendrix. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given Fendrix: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have any known allergies </li>
<li>if you have had any health problems after having a vaccine in the past. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before having 
Fendrix. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fendrix </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, might take any other medicines or have 
recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<ul>
<li>You should have a gap of at least 2 to 3 weeks between having Fendrix and any other vaccine. </li>
<li>Fendrix may need to be given at the same time as an injection of hepatitis B  immuno-globulins . 
Your doctor will make sure that the vaccines are injected into different parts of the body. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before you are given this vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You may feel tired or get a headache after receiving Fendrix. If this happens, take special care while 
driving or using any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Fendrix contains sodium </p>
<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
