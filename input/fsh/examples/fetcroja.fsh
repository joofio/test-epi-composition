6);</p>
<p>if you are allergic to other antibiotics known as cephalosporins;</p>
<p>if you have had a severe allergic reaction to certain antibiotics, such as penicillins or
carbapenems. This can include severe skin peeling, swelling of the hands, face, feet, lips, tongue
or throat; or difficulty swallowing or breathing.
  Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Fetcroja: </p>
<p>if you have ever had any allergic reaction to other antibiotics. See also section above,  Do not
use Fetcroja ;</p>
<p>if you have kidney problems. Your doctor will adjust your dose to ensure you don t get too much
or too little medicine;</p>
<p>if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment;</p>
<p>if you are on a low sodium diet;</p>
<p>if you have ever had seizures.
  Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Fetcroja.
New Infection 
Although Fetcroja can fight certain bacteria, there is a possibility that you may get a different infection 
caused by another organism during or after your treatment. Your doctor will monitor you closely for 
any new infections and give you another treatment if necessary. 
Blood/laboratory Tests 
Tell your doctor that you are taking Fetcroja if you are going to have any blood/laboratory tests. This 
is because you may get an abnormal result. With something called a  Coombs test  this looks for the 
presence of antibodies that can destroy red blood cells or may be affected by the response of your 
immune system to Fetcroja. Fetcroja may also result in false-positive results in urine dipstick tests 
(urine protein or diabetes markers). 
Children and adolescents 
Fetcroja should not be given to children and adolescents under the age of 18. This is because it is not 
known if the medicine is safe to use in these age groups. 
Other medicines and Fetcroja 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Fetcroja does not affect your ability to drive or operate machinery. 
Fetcroja contains sodium 
This medicine contains 7.64 mmol (176 mg) of sodium per vial. The total daily dose is 2.1 g, just 
greater than the WHO recommend daily maximum of 2 g sodium for an adult. Talk to your doctor 
before you are given Fetcroja if you are on a low sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

The number of days you will be given Fetcroja treatment depends on the type of infection you have 
and how well your infection is clearing. 
If you get any pain where the Fetcroja infusion goes into your vein, tell your doctor or nurse. 
People with kidney problems 
If you have kidney problems, talk to your doctor before you are given Fetcroja. The doctor will adjust 
your dose of Fetcroja. 
If you are given more Fetcroja than you should 
Fetcroja will be given to you by a doctor or nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong dose. 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you think you have been given more Fetcroja than you 
should have.
