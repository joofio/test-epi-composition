  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Filgrastim HEXAL is a white blood cell growth factor (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and 
belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines. Growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally 
in the body but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. Filgrastim HEXAL 
works by encouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells.
A reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes 
your body less able to fight infection. Filgrastim HEXAL stimulates the bone marrow to produce new 
white cells quickly.
Filgrastim HEXAL can be used:</p>
<p>to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent 
infections;</p>
<p>to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent 
infections;</p>
<p>before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be 
collected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from a 
donor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells;</p>
<p>to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help 
prevent infections;</p>
<p>in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Filgrastim HEXAL.
Please tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have:
-
osteoporosis (bone disease);
-
sickle cell anaemia, as Filgrastim HEXAL may cause sickle cell crisis.
Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Filgrastim HEXAL, if you:
-
get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left 
shoulder [these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of 
the spleen].
-
notice unusual bleeding or bruising [these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets 
(thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot].
-
have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, 
tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these 
could be signs of a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity).
-
experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you 
notice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis).
-
have symptoms of inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood 
from the heart to the body); this was reported in rare cases in cancer patients and healthy donors. 
The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased 
inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms.
Loss of response to filgrastim
If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your 
doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise filgrastim s activity.
Your doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet.
If you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the 
blood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]). You should talk to your doctor about your risks 
of developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to 
develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Filgrastim HEXAL unless instructed by your doctor.
If you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between 16 and 60 years.
Take special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells.
Filgrastim HEXAL is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. 
Your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using.
Other medicines and Filgrastim HEXAL
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Filgrastim HEXAL has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women.
Filgrastim HEXAL is not recommended during pregnancy.
It is important to tell your doctor if you:</p>
<p>are pregnant or breast-feeding;</p>
<p>think you may be pregnant; or</p>
<p>are planning to have a baby.
If you become pregnant during Filgrastim HEXAL treatment, please inform your doctor.
Unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast feeding if you use Filgrastim HEXAL.
Driving and using machines
Filgrastim HEXAL may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. This 
medicine may cause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after taking Filgrastim 
HEXAL and before driving or operating machinery.
Filgrastim HEXAL contains sorbitol and sodium
Filgrastim HEXAL contains sorbitol (E420).
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare 
genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break 
down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your 
child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects 
such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea.
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

How is Filgrastim HEXAL given and how much should I use?
Filgrastim HEXAL is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a 
subcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an 
intravenous infusion). The usual dose varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will 
tell you how much Filgrastim HEXAL you should take.
Patients having a bone marrow transplant after chemotherapy:
You will normally receive your first dose of Filgrastim HEXAL at least 24 hours after your 
chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant.
You, or people caring for you, can be taught how to give subcutaneous injections so that you can 
continue your treatment at home. However, you should not attempt this unless you have been properly 
trained first by your health care provider.
How long will I have to take Filgrastim HEXAL?
You will need to take Filgrastim HEXAL until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood 
tests will be taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you 
how long you will need to take Filgrastim HEXAL.
Use in children
Filgrastim HEXAL is used to treat children who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from 
severe low white blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children receiving chemotherapy is the 
same as for adults.
If you use more Filgrastim HEXAL than you should
Do not increase the dose your doctor has given you. If you think you have injected more than you 
should, contact your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to use Filgrastim HEXAL
If you have missed an injection, or injected too little, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for any missed doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment:</p>
<p>if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the 
face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). </p>
<p>if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). </p>
<p>if you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of 
your shoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen [enlargement of the spleen 
(splenomegaly) or rupture of the spleen].</p>
<p>if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine 
(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if 
protein is found in your urine (proteinuria).</p>
<h2>if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:</h2>
<p>swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, 
difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of 
tiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion.
These could be symptoms of a condition called  Capillary Leak Syndrome  which causes blood 
to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention.</p>
<h2>if you have a combination of any of the following symptoms:</h2>
<p>fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, 
shortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin.
These could be symptoms of a condition called  sepsis  (also called "blood poisoning"), a 
severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and 
needs urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>if you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients 
who received filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or 
ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual.
A common side effect of filgrastim use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which 
can be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a stem cell 
or bone marrow transplant, Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) may occur- this is a reaction of the 
donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms 
of your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, 
lungs, vagina and joints. Very commonly seen in normal stem cell donors is increase in white blood 
cells (leukocytosis) and decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot 
(thrombocytopenia), these will be monitored by your doctor.
