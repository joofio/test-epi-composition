epilepsy called Dravet syndrome or one called Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It can help to reduce the 
number and severity of seizures. </p>
<p>It is not completely known how Fintepla works. However, it is thought to work by increasing the 
activity in the brain of a natural substance called serotonin and the sigma 1 receptor, and this may 
reduce seizures. </p>         </div>"""

<em> you or your child are allergic to fenfluramine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6) 
* you or your child have a heart problem such as  valve disease  or  pulmonary arterial 
hypertension  (high pressure in the arteries of the lungs)<br />
</em> you or your child have taken medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the last 
2 weeks. </p>
<p>Do not take Fintepla if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before taking Fintepla. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Fintepla if: 
* you or your child have glaucoma </p>
<ul>
<li>you or your child have had thoughts about harming or killing yourself </li>
<li>you or your child are taking a medicine called cyproheptadine, which is used to treat allergies or 
to improve appetite. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above applies to you or your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before taking Fintepla. </p>
<p>Tests and checks 
Before you or your child start taking Fintepla your doctor must check the heart with an 
echocardiogram (ECHO). The doctor will check that the valves in the heart work properly and the 
pressure in the artery between the heart and lungs is not too high. Once you or your child has started 
taking Fintepla, you will have an echocardiogram check every 6 months for the first 2 years and then 
once a year. If Fintepla treatment is stopped, you or your child will need to have an echocardiogram 
6 months after the last dose. </p>
<p>Your doctor should also check your weight before and during your treatment as Fintepla can cause you 
to lose weight. </p>
<p>Serotonin syndrome<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fintepla if you or your child are taking medicines which 
can increase the levels of serotonin in your brain. This is because taking these medicines and Fintepla 
can cause serotonin syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition. Medicines that can increase 
serotonin levels include: 
*  triptans  (such as sumatriptan)   used for migraine 
* MAOI medicines   used for depression 
* SSRI or SNRI medicines   used for depression and anxiety. </p>
<p>Look out for the signs of serotonin syndrome which include: 
* being agitated, seeing things which are not there (hallucinations) or passing out 
* heart and circulation problems such as fast heartbeat, blood pressure going up and down, high 
body temperature, sweating 
* twitching muscles and being uncoordinated 
* feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the serious side effects above. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fintepla 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any 
other medicines. This is because Fintepla can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some 
other medicines can affect the way Fintepla works.  </p>
<p>Fintepla can make you or your child feel sleepy. You or your child may be even more sleepy if you 
take other medicines such as anti-depressants or alcohol at the same time as Fintepla. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or 
might take: 
* stiripentol, a medicine for epilepsy, as your dose of Fintepla may need to be reduced 
*  triptans , MAOI, SNRI or SSRI medicines   see above under  Serotonin syndrome<br />
* carbamazepine, primidone, rifampicin, phenobarbital and other barbiturates, phenytoin, and 
efavirenz, as your dose of Fintepla may need to be increased. </p>
<p>Also speak with your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child smoke as the dose of Fintepla may 
need to be increased. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you or your child are pregnant, think you or your child might be pregnant, or are planning to have a 
baby or are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Talk to your doctor about driving, using machines, or if you or your child undertake activities such as 
cycling or other sports, because you or your child may feel sleepy after taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Fintepla contains sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl p-
hydroxybenzoate (E 219)<br />
This may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). </p>
<p>Fintepla contains sulfur dioxide (E 220)<br />
This may rarely cause hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. </p>
<p>Fintepla contains glucose 
This may be harmful to the teeth. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>Fintepla contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 12 ml, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Write on the carton the date you first opened 
the bottle. 
You must attach the bottle adaptor the first 
time you open the bottle. The following 
instructions tell you how to attach the 
adaptor. 
Inserting the bottle adaptor: 
When the bottle is first opened the bottle 
adaptor must be pushed into the bottle. 
Wash and dry your hands. 
Remove the bottle adaptor from its 
packaging. 
Place the bottle on a flat, firm surface. 
Open the bottle. </p>
<p>Hold the bottle firmly. 
Line up the bottle adapter with the open top 
of the bottle. 
Push the bottle adaptor into the bottle with 
your palm until the adaptor is flush with the 
top of the bottle. 
Leave in the bottle adaptor after using the 
medicine. 
Screw the bottle cap onto the bottle with the 
bottle adaptor left in. </p>
<p>Taking the medicine: 
Before you measure out the dose, make sure 
the plunger is pushed all the way into the oral 
syringe. 
Hold the bottle of medicine firmly on a hard, 
flat surface. 
Push the tip of the oral syringe into the bottle 
adaptor until it cannot be pushed further. </p>
<p>Hold the oral syringe and bottle together and 
turn upside down. 
Slowly pull the plunger to draw up the right 
dose. 
Hold the oral syringe and bottle together and 
then turn over. 
Holding the bottle firmly, gently pull the oral 
syringe out of the bottle adaptor. </p>
<p>Place the tip of the oral syringe against the 
inside of the patient s cheek. 
Gently push the plunger until it is fully 
pressed. There will be a small volume left in 
the tip of the syringe. This is normal. 
Do not squirt the medicine into the back of 
the throat as this may cause choking. </p>
<p>Place the cap back on the bottle and turn until 
it stops.<br />
Always leave the adaptor in place in the 
bottle. </p>
<p>Cleaning the syringe: 
Rinse the oral syringe with clean water and 
allow it to air dry after each use.<br />
Rinse the inside of the syringe and the 
plunger. 
Clean water can be pulled into the syringe 
with the plunger and pushed out several 
times to clean the syringe. 
It is okay to separate the plunger from the 
syringe to rinse each part. 
It is safe to clean the syringe and plunger in a 
dishwasher. 
The syringe and plunger must be completely 
dry before the next use. </p>
<p>If you or your child take more Fintepla than you or your child should 
Talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take the medicine bottle with you. The following 
effects may happen: being agitated, sleepy or confused, being flushed or hot, shivering and sweating. </p>
<p>If you or your child forget to take Fintepla 
* Take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is nearly time to take the next dose, skip the 
missed dose.<br />
* Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you or your child stop taking Fintepla 
Do not stop taking Fintepla without talking to your doctor. If your doctor decides to stop this 
medicine, the doctor will ask you or your child to slowly lower the amount taken each day. Slowly 
lowering the dose will reduce the risk of having a seizure and status epilepticus. 
Six months after the last dose of Fintepla, you or your child will need to have an echocardiogram. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  </p>         </div>"""
