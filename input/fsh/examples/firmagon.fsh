Degarelix is a synthetic hormone blocker used in the treatment of prostate cancer and for the treatment of 
high-risk prostate cancer prior to radiotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy in adult male patients. 
Degarelix mimics a natural hormone (gonadotrophin-relasing hormone, GnRH) and directly blocks its 
effects. By doing so, degarelix immediately reduces the level of the male hormone testosterone that 
stimulates the prostate cancer. </p>         </div>"""
