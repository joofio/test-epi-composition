- if you are allergic to temoporfin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6), 
- if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to porphyrins, 
- if you have porphyria, or any other disease that is made worse by light, 
- if the tumour being treated goes through a large blood vessel, 
- if you are going to have an operation in the next 30 days, 
- if you have an eye disease which needs examination with bright light in the next 30 days, 
- if you are already being treated with a photosensitising agent. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Foscan will make you sensitive to light for about 15 days after your injection. This means that 
normal daylight or bright indoor lighting could give you skin burns. To stop this, you must 
follow carefully the instructions for gradual exposure to increasing light levels indoors over 
the first week and outdoor, shaded light during the second week after treatment (please see the 
table at the end of this leaflet).  </p>
<p>Please speak to your doctor about this before you go home after being injected with Foscan.  </p>
<p>Sunscreen creams will not prevent this sensitivity.  </p>
<p>You will gradually become less sensitive to light. Normally, people are able to begin to return 
to normal outdoor lighting after 15 days.  </p>
<p>Do not let an optician or ophthalmologist examine your eyes with bright lights for 30 days 
after Foscan injection. </p>
<p>Do not use UV sunbeds or sunbathe for 3 months after Foscan injection. </p>
<p>For 6 months following Foscan treatment, avoid prolonged direct sunlight exposure of the 
injection site arm. As a precautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is planned, 
protect your injection arm by wearing long sleeved, coloured clothing. </p>
<p>The table of instructions tells you what to do to prevent skin burns. You must follow these 
instructions carefully.  </p>
<p>Please ask your doctor or nurse if you are not sure about anything. </p>
<p>Time after<br />
Foscan Injection 
What should I do to prevent burns? </p>
<p>Day 1 (0-hours) </p>
<p>Stay indoors in a darkened room. Keep the curtains drawn and use light bulbs of 
60 W or less. 
Avoid exposure to direct sunlight. </p>
<p>Days 2-7 </p>
<p>You can gradually return to normal indoor lighting. Remember to avoid direct 
sunlight coming through the window or direct light from household 
appliances such as reading lamps. You may watch television.  </p>
<p>You can go outdoors after dusk. </p>
<p>If it is absolutely necessary to go outdoors during the hours of daylight, you 
must be careful to cover up all your skin including your face and hands and 
wear dark glasses.  </p>
<p>The type of clothes you must wear are: </p>
<p>Wide-brimmed hat: for head, neck, nose and ears. </p>
<p>Scarf: for head and neck. </p>
<p>Sunglasses with side panels: for eyes and skin around eyes. </p>
<p>Long sleeved top: for upper body/arms. </p>
<p>Long trousers: for lower body/legs. </p>
<p>Gloves: for hands, wrist and fingers. </p>
<p>Socks: for feet and ankles. </p>
<p>Closed shoes: for feet. </p>
<p>Do not wear very thin clothing because it will not protect you from 
strong light. Wear dark, closely woven clothing. </p>
<p>If you expose yourself to light by mistake, you may get a prickly or 
burning feeling on the skin. You must get out of the light immediately. </p>
<p>Your eyes may be very sensitive to bright lights during this week. You may get 
eye pain or headache when lights are switched on. If you have this problem, 
wear dark glasses. </p>
<p>Days 8-You can now begin to go outside during daylight hours. Stay in shaded areas or 
go out when it is cloudy. Continue to wear dark, closely woven clothing. </p>
<p>Start on Day 8 with 10-15 minutes outdoors. If you do not see any skin redness 
in the next 24 hours, you can gradually increase your time outdoors during the 
week. </p>
<p>Avoid direct sunlight or strong indoor lighting. Stay in the shade. </p>
<p>Day 15 onward </p>
<p>Your sensitivity to light is gradually getting back to normal.  </p>
<p>You must test this carefully by exposing the back of your hand to the sun for 
5 minutes. Wait 24 hours to see if there is any redness. If there is redness, you 
should avoid direct sunlight for another 24 hours. You can then repeat the test. </p>
<p>If there is no redness, you can gradually increase your exposure to sunlight day 
by day. Do not stay in the sunlight for more than 15 minutes the first time. Most 
people will be able to go back to their normal routine by Day 22. On the first day after the skin test, you can stay in direct sunlight for minutes. You can increase your exposure by another 15 minutes each day i.e. 
second day 30 minutes, third day 45 minutes, fourth day 60 minutes and so on. 
If at any time you notice a prickly or burning feeling or see skin reddening after 
exposure to sun, wait until this disappears before exposing your skin to light for 
this length of time again. </p>
<p>For 30 days following Foscan treatment, avoid eye tests that use bright lights. 
For 3 months following Foscan treatment, avoid UV tanning beds. Do not 
sunbathe. </p>
<p>For 6 months following Foscan treatment, care should be taken to avoid direct 
prolonged sunlight exposure of the arm used for Foscan injection. As a 
precautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is planned, the injection 
arm should be protected by wearing long sleeved, coloured clothing. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Foscan 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>You must avoid becoming pregnant for 3 months after Foscan treatment. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed for at least 1 month after Foscan injection. </p>

few hours after injection.  </p>
<p>It is not recommended to drive or operate machines for the first 15 days after Foscan injection, 
because of the recommended light exposure restrictions </p>

disease or epilepsy are also at risk.

<p>Everyone who takes Foscan will become sensitive to light for about 15 days after injection. </p>
<p>You must follow the instructions given to you to avoid sunlight and bright indoor light.  </p>
<p>These instructions are written in this leaflet. Your doctor will also tell you what to do.<br />
If you do not follow these instructions, you may get severe sunburn that leads to permanent 
scarring. </p>
<p>Most of the side effects related with photodynamic therapy are local effects seen as consequence of 
triggering the Foscan with the laser. You may feel pain after the laser treatment. This pain will be 
controlled with painkillers. Please let your doctor or nurse know if you have pain or if the painkillers 
you have been given are not taking the pain away. Furthermore you will probably notice swelling and 
reddening around the area that has been treated. You may be given some medicine to reduce the 
swelling. After 2 to 4 days, the treated area will turn black. This blackness is caused by dead cancer 
cells (necrosis). Foscan may also damage the tissue that is surrounding the tumour. </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): </p>
<p>You may feel some pain when Foscan is injected.  </p>
<p>After the laser treatment, you may feel pain in the treated area, e.g. pain in your face or 
headache. </p>
<p>There may also be bleeding, ulcers, swelling in the treated area like swelling of your face or 
tongue, and scarring. </p>
<p>You may get constipation. 
These effects may make it difficult to eat and drink.  </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): </p>
<p>There may be some irritation, a burning sensation or skin damage where Foscan is injected, 
but this will not last long.  </p>

<p>Vomiting </p>
<p>Fever </p>
<p>Nausea </p>

<p>Events occurring at a frequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available 
data): </p>
<p>Airway blocking as consequence of swelling in the treated area </p>
<p>Fistula in the treated area </p>
<p>Sepsis </p>
