  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>GANFORT contains two different active substances (bimatoprost and timolol) that both reduce 
pressure in the eye. Bimatoprost belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides, a prostaglandin 
analogue. Timolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers. <br />
Your eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being 
drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly 
enough, the pressure inside the eye builds up and could eventually damage your sight (an illness called 
glaucoma). GANFORT works by reducing the production of liquid and also increasing the amount of 
liquid that is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye.
GANFORT eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye in adults, including the elderly. This 
high pressure can lead to glaucoma. Your doctor will prescribe you GANFORT when other eye drops 
containing beta-blockers or prostaglandin analogues  have not worked sufficiently on their own.</p>         </div>"""

choking), heart failure, low blood pressure, 
-
disturbances of heart rate such as slow heart beat 
-

<h2>separation of one of the layers within the eyeball after surgery to reduce the pressure in the eye</h2>
<p>known risk factors for macular oedema (swelling of the retina within the eye leading to 
worsening vision), for example, cataract surgery
Tell your doctor before surgical anaesthesia that you are using GANFORT as timolol may change 
effects of some medicines used during anaesthesia.
GANFORT may cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to 
darken too. The colour of your iris may also go darker over time.  These changes may be permanent. 
The change may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye. GANFORT may cause hair 
growth when in contact with the skin surface.
Children and adolescents 
GANFORT should not be used in children and teenagers under 18. Other medicines and GANFORT
GANFORT can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for 
the treatment of glaucoma. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken 
or might take any other medicines. Tell your doctor if you are using or intend to use medicines to 
lower blood pressure, heart medicine, medicines to treat diabetes, quinidine (used to treat heart 
conditions and some types of malaria) or medicines to treat depression known as fluoxetine and 
paroxetine.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use GANFORT if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor still recommends it.
Do not use GANFORT if you are breast-feeding. Timolol may get into your breast milk.
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine during breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
GANFORT may cause blurred vision in some patients. Do not drive or use machines until the 
symptoms have cleared.
GANFORT contains Benzalkonium chloride
Ganfort contains a preservative called benzalkonium chloride. 
This medicine contains 0.15 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to 
0.05 mg/ml. 
Benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the 
contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back minutes afterwards.
Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of 
the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain 
in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use GANFORT exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The usual dose is one drop once a day, either in the morning or in the evening in each eye that needs 
treatment.  Use at the same time each day.
Instructions for use
You must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it.
5. 1. Wash your hands. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling.
2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket.
3. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs treatment.
4. Let go of the lower lid, and close your eye.
5. Whilst keeping the eye closed, press your finger against the corner of the closed eye (the site where 
the eye meets the nose) and hold for 2 minutes. This helps to stop GANFORT getting into the rest of 
the body.
If a drop misses your eye, try again.
To avoid contamination, do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or anything else. Put the cap 
back on and close the bottle straight after you have used it.
If you use GANFORT with another eye medicine, leave at least 5 minutes between putting in 
GANFORT and the other medicine. Use any eye ointment or eye gel last.
If you use more GANFORT than you should
If you use more GANFORT than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your 
next dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
If you forget to use GANFORT
If you forget to use GANFORT, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your 
regular routine. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using GANFORT
GANFORT should be used every day to work properly.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.status = #additional
  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, GANFORT can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  You can 
usually carry on taking the drops, unless the effects are serious. If you re worried, talk to a doctor or 
pharmacist. Do not stop using Ganfort without speaking to your doctor. 
The following side effects may be seen with GANFORT (multi-dose and/or single-dose): 
Very common side effects
These may affect more than 1 user in Affecting the eye
redness.
Common side effects
These may affect 1 to 9 users in Affecting the eye
burning, itching, stinging, irritation of the conjunctiva (see-through layer of the eye), sensitivity to 
light, eye pain, sticky eyes, dry eyes, a feeling of something in the eye, small breaks in the surface of 
the eye with or without inflammation, difficulty in seeing clearly, redness and itching of the eyelids, 
hair growing around the eye, darkening of the eyelids, darker skin colour around the eyes, longer 
eyelashes, eye irritation, watery eyes, swollen eyelids, reduced vision.
Affecting other parts of the body
runny nose, headache.
Uncommon side effects
These may affect 1 to 9 users in 1,Affecting the eye
abnormal sensation in the eye, iris inflammation, swollen conjunctiva (see-through layer of the eye), 
painful eyelids, tired eyes, in-growing eyelashes, darkening of iris colour, eyes appear sunken, eyelid 
drooping, eyelid shrinking (moving away from the surface of the eye leading to incomplete closure of 
the eyelids), skin tightness of the eyelids, darkening of eyelashes.
Affecting other parts of the body
shortness of breath.
Side effects where the frequency is not known 
Affecting the eye
cystoid macular oedema (swelling of the retina within the eye leading to worsening vision), eye 
swelling, blurred vision, ocular discomfort.
Affecting other parts of the body
difficulty breathing / wheezing, symptoms of allergic reaction (swelling, redness of the eye and rash of 
the skin), changes in your taste sensation, dizziness, slowing of heart rate, high blood pressure,
difficulty sleeping, nightmare, asthma, hair loss, skin discolouration (periocular), tiredness.
Additional side effects have been seen in patients using eye drops containing timolol or bimatoprost 
and so may possibly be seen with GANFORT. Like other medicines applied into eyes, timolol is 
absorbed into the blood. This may cause similar side effects as seen with  intravenous  and /or  oral<br />
beta-blocking agents. The chance of having side effects after using eye drops is lower than when 
medicines are for example, taken by mouth or injected. Listed side effects include reactions seen 
within bimatoprost and timolol when used for treating eye conditions:
  Severe allergic reactions with swelling and difficulty breathing which could be life-threatening 
  Low blood sugar
  Depression; memory loss; hallucination
  Fainting; stroke; decreased blood flow to the brain; worsening of myasthenia gravis (increased 
muscle weakness); tingling sensation
  Decreased sensation of your eye surface; double vision; drooping eyelid; separation of one of 
the layers within the eyeball after surgery to reduce the pressure in the eye; inflammation of 
the surface of the eye, bleeding in the back of the eye (retinal bleeding), inflammation within 
the eye, increased blinking
  Heart failure; irregularity or stopping of the heartbeat; slow or fast heartbeat; too much fluid, 
mainly water, accumulating in the body; chest pain
  Low blood pressure, swelling or coldness of your hands, feet and extremities, caused by 
constriction of your blood vessels
  Cough, worsening of asthma, worsening of the lung disease called chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) 
  Diarrhoea; stomach pain; feeling and being sick; indigestion; dry mouth
  Red scaly patches on skin; skin rash
  Muscle pain
  Reduced sexual urge; sexual dysfunction
  Weakness
  An increase in blood test results that show how your liver is working
Other side effects reported with eye drops containing phosphates
This medicine contains 2.85 mg phosphates in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to 0.mg/ml. If you suffer from severe damage to the clear layer at the front of the eye (the cornea), 
phosphates may cause in very rare cases cloudy patches on the cornea due to calcium build-up during 
treatment. 
Reporting side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.</p>         </div>"""
