<p>Gazyvaro contains the active substance obinutuzumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
 monoclonal antibodies . Antibodies work by attaching themselves to specific targets in your body. </p>
<p>What Gazyvaro is used for </p>
<p>Gazyvaro can be used in adults to treat two different types of cancer </p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (also called  CLL ) </li>
<li>Gazyvaro is used in patients who have not had any treatment for CLL before and who 
have other illnesses which make it unlikely that they would be able to tolerate a full dose 
of a different medicine used to treat CLL called fludarabine. </li>
<li>
<p>Gazyvaro is used together with another medicine for cancer called chlorambucil. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follicular lymphoma (also called  FL ) </p>
</li>
<li>Gazyvaro is used in patients who have not had any treatment for FL  </li>
<li>Gazyvaro is used in patients who have had at least one treatment with a medicine called 
rituximab before and whose FL has come back or got worse during or after this treatment.  </li>
<li>At the start of treatment for FL, Gazyvaro is used together with other medicines for 
cancer.  </li>
<li>Gazyvaro can then be used on its own for up to 2 years as a  maintenance treatment . </li>
</ul>
<p>How Gazyvaro works </p>
<ul>
<li>CLL and FL are types of cancer that affect white blood cells called  B-lymphocytes . The 
affected  B-lymphocytes  multiply too quickly and live too long. Gazyvaro binds to targets on 
the surface of the affected  B-lymphocyte  cells and causes them to die.   </li>
<li>When Gazyvaro is given to patients with CLL or FL together with other medicines for<br />
cancer - this slows down the time it takes for their disease to get worse. </li>

<ul>
<li>you are allergic to obinutuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure talk to your doctor or nurse before being given Gazyvaro. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Gazyvaro if: 
* you have an infection, or have had an infection in the past which lasted a long time or keeps 
coming back<br />
<em> you have ever taken, or been given, medicines which affect your immune system (such as 
chemotherapy or immunosuppressants) 
* you are taking medicines for high blood pressure or medicines used to thin your blood   your 
doctor might need to alter how you take these 
* you have ever had heart problems 
* you have ever had brain problems (such as memory problems, difficulty moving or feeling 
sensations in your body, eyesight problems) 
* you have ever had breathing problems or lung problems 
* you have ever had   hepatitis B  - a type of liver disease<br />
</em> you are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
Gazyvaro.  </p>
<p>Pay attention to the following side effects  </p>
<p>Gazyvaro can cause some serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight 
away. These include:  </p>
<p>Infusion related reactions  </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion related reactions listed at 
the start of section 4. Infusion related reactions can happen during the infusion or up to 24 hours 
after the infusion.  </li>
<li>If you get an infusion related reaction, you may require additional treatment, or the infusion 
may need to be slowed down or stopped. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the 
infusion can be continued. These reactions are more likely to happen with the first infusion. 
Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Gazyvaro if you have a severe infusion related 
reaction. </li>
<li>Before each infusion of Gazyvaro, you will be given medicines which help to reduce possible 
infusion related reactions or  tumour lysis syndrome .  Tumour lysis syndrome is a potentially 
life-threatening complication, caused by chemical changes in the blood due to the breakdown of 
dying cancer cells (see section 3). </li>
</ul>
<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (also called  PML ) </p>
<ul>
<li>PML is a very rare and life-threatening brain infection that has been reported in very few 
patients having treatment with Gazyvaro.  </li>
<li>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have memory loss, trouble speaking, difficulty 
walking or problems with your eyesight.  </li>
<li>If you had any of these symptoms before treatment with Gazyvaro, tell your doctor straight 
away if you notice any changes in them. You may need medical treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infections  </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any signs of infection after your Gazyvaro 
treatment (see "Infections" in section 4). </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give Gazyvaro to children or young people under 18 years of age. This is because there is no 
information about its use in these age groups.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Gazyvaro </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might start taking any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy  </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to 
have a baby. They will help you weigh up the benefit of continuing Gazyvaro against the risk to 
your baby.  </li>
<li>If you become pregnant during treatment with Gazyvaro, tell your doctor or nurse as soon as 
possible. This is because treatment with Gazyvaro may affect yours or the baby s health.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Gazyvaro or for 18 months after stopping treatment 
with Gazyvaro. This is because small amounts of the medicine may pass into your breast milk. </li>
</ul>
<p>Contraception </p>
<ul>
<li>Use an effective method of contraception while being treated with Gazyvaro. </li>
<li>Continue to use effective contraception for 18 months after stopping treatment with Gazyvaro.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>Gazyvaro is not likely to affect your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. However, if 
you get an infusion related reaction, (see section 4), do not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines 
until the reaction stops. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Gazyvaro is given under the supervision of a doctor experienced in such treatment. It is given into a 
vein as a drip (intravenous infusion) over several hours. 
The Gazyvaro treatment </p>
<p>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia </p>
<ul>
<li>You will be given 6 treatment cycles of Gazyvaro in combination with another medicine for 
cancer called chlorambucil. Each cycle lasts 28 days.  </li>
<li>On Day 1 of your first cycle, you will be given part of your first Gazyvaro dose of milligrams (mg) very slowly. Your doctor/nurse will monitor you carefully for infusion related 
reactions.  </li>
<li>If you do not have an infusion related reaction following the small part of your first dose, you 
may be given the rest of your first dose (900 mg) on the same day.  </li>
<li>If you do have an infusion related reaction following the small part of your first dose, you will 
be given the rest of your first dose on Day 2. A typical schedule is shown below.<br />
Cycle 1 - this will include three doses of Gazyvaro in the 28 days: </li>
<li>Day 1   part of your first dose (100 mg) </li>
<li>Day 2 or Day 1 (continued)   remainder of first dose 900 mg </li>
<li>Day 8   full dose (1,000 mg) </li>
<li>Day 15   full dose (1,000 mg) </li>
</ul>
<p>Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6  this will be just one dose of Gazyvaro in the 28 days: 
* Day 1   full dose (1,000 mg). </p>
<p>Follicular lymphoma </p>
<ul>
<li>You will be given 6 or 8 treatment cycles of Gazyvaro in combination with other medicines for 
cancer - each cycle lasts 28 or 21 days depending on which other cancer medicines are given 
together with Gazyvaro. </li>
<li>This induction phase will be followed by a  maintenance phase  - during this time you will be 
given Gazyvaro every 2 months for up to 2 years as long as your disease does not progress. 
Based on your disease status after the initial treatment cycles your doctor will decide whether 
you will receive treatment in the maintenance phase. </li>
<li>A typical schedule is shown below.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Induction phase </p>
<p>Cycle 1 - this will include three doses of Gazyvaro in the 28 or 21 days depending on which other 
cancer medicines are given together with Gazyvaro: 
* Day 1 - full dose (1,000 mg) 
* Day 8 - full dose (1,000 mg) 
* Day 15 - full dose (1,000 mg). </p>
<p>Cycles 2-6 or 2-8 - this will be just one dose of Gazyvaro in the 28 or 21 days depending on which 
other cancer medicines are given together with Gazyvaro: 
* Day 1 - full dose (1,000 mg). </p>
<p>Maintenance phase </p>
<ul>
<li>Full dose (1,000 mg) once every 2 months for up to 2 years as long as your disease does not 
progress. </li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines given before each infusion  </p>
<p>Before each infusion of Gazyvaro, you will be given medicines to lessen the chance of getting infusion 
related reactions or tumour lysis syndrome. These may include: </p>
<ul>
<li>fluids  </li>
<li>medicines to reduce a fever </li>
<li>medicines to reduce pain (analgesics) </li>
<li>
<p>medicines to reduce inflammation (corticosteroids) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicines to reduce an allergic reaction (anti-histamines) </p>
</li>
<li>medicine to prevent tumour lysis syndrome (such as allopurinol). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you miss a Gazyvaro treatment </p>
<p>If you miss your appointment, make another one as soon as possible. This is because for this medicine 
to be as effective as possible, it is important to follow the dosing schedule.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
