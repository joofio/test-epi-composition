<p>Givlaari contains the active substance  givosiran . </p>
<p>What Givlaari is used for </p>
<p>Givlaari is used to treat acute hepatic porphyria in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. </p>
<p>What acute hepatic porphyria is </p>
<p>Acute hepatic porphyria is a rare illness that runs in families. It is caused by a defect in one of the 
proteins that make a molecule called haem in the liver. Because there is a problem in one of the 
proteins required to make haem, there is a build-up of some of the substances that are used to produce 
haem, namely aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). Having too much ALA and 
PBG can injure nerves and cause serious attacks of pain, nausea, muscle weakness and changes in 
mental functioning. Some people with acute hepatic porphyria may also have symptoms, such as pain 
and nausea, in between attacks. Longer-term complications that can be seen in people with acute 
hepatic porphyria include high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and liver disease. </p>
<p>How Givlaari works </p>
<p>This medicine works by lowering the amount of an enzyme, called ALAS1, that controls how much 
ALA and PBG are made by the liver. By lowering ALAS1, the liver makes less ALA and PBG. This 
can help to reduce the effects of this illness. </p>         </div>"""

away and you may need to take other medicines to control the symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Liver problems </p>
<p>Using this medicine can affect your liver. You will have blood tests to check your liver function before 
you start treatment with Givlaari and periodically during treatment. If these tests show abnormal 
results, your doctor or nurse will decide whether to interrupt treatment or stop treatment permanently. 
Abnormal results have been seen in some patients treated with this medicine, mainly between 3 to 
5 months after starting treatment. </p>
<p>Kidney problems </p>
<p>Using this medicine can affect your kidneys, especially if you have already been diagnosed with 
kidney problems. Your doctor will check how your kidneys are working while you are using this 
medicine, especially if you already have kidney problems. </p>
<p>Tests for homocysteine levels </p>
<p>While receiving this medicine, blood tests may show an increase in homocysteine, a type of amino 
acid, compared to your homocysteine levels before starting treatment. Your doctor will check the 
levels of homocysteine in your blood before and during treatment. If your homocysteine levels are 
elevated, your doctor may give you homocysteine-lowering therapy. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>This medicine should not be used in children below 12 years of age because there is no experience of 
using the medicine in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Givlaari </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might be using any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>When using certain medicines, this medicine may prolong or increase their effect or change their side 
effects. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
nurse for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Studies in animals suggest this medicine may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding ask your 
doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop 
breast-feeding or to stop treatment with Givlaari taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for 
your child and benefit of therapy for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>This medicine is unlikely to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Givlaari contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially  sodium-
