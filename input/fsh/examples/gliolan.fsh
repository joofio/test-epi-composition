<p>Gliolan contains a substance called aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). 5-ALA accumulates preferably in 
tumour cells where it is transformed into another similar substance. If the tumour is then exposed to 
blue light, this new substance emits a red-violet light which helps to better see what is normal tissue 
and what is tumour tissue. This helps the surgeon to remove the tumour while sparing healthy tissue. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Most serious side effects include mild alterations of blood cell counts (red and white cells, platelets), 
disorders that affect the nervous system (neurological disorders) like partial paralysis of one side of 
the body (hemiparesis) and blood clots that may obstruct blood vessels (thromboembolism). Further 
frequently observed side effects are being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) and slight increase of 
some enzymes (transaminases,  -GT, amylase) or bilirubin (a bile pigment produced in the liver by 
breakdown of red blood pigment) in the blood.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any complaints. </p>
<p>Side effects are divided into the following two categories: 
* immediate side effects after having taken Gliolan and before anaesthesia 
* combined side effects of Gliolan, anaesthesia, and tumour resection. </p>
<p>After having taken Gliolan and before start of anaesthesia, the following side effects may occur:  </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
Feeling sick (nausea), decrease of blood pressure (hypotension), skin reactions (for example rash, 
looking like sunburn). </p>
<p>In combination with anaesthesia and tumour resection further side effects may occur:<br />
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
Mild alterations of blood cell counts (red and white cells, platelets), and slight increase of some 
enzymes (transaminases,  -GT, amylase) or bilirubin (a bile pigment produced in the liver by 
breakdown of red blood pigment) in the blood. These changes peak between 7 and 14 days after 
surgery. The changes will completely resolve within a few weeks. Usually you will not 
experience any symptoms when these changes occur. </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
Feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), disorders that affect the nervous system 
(neurological disorders) like partial paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis), total or partial 
loss of ability to use or understand language (aphasia), seizures (convulsions) and blindness for 
half the field of vision in one or both eyes (hemianopsia), and blood clots that may obstruct blood 
vessels (thromboembolism). </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
Decrease of blood pressure (hypotension), brain swelling (brain oedema). </p>
<p>Very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people) or not known (frequency cannot 
be estimated from the available data): 
Decrease of your sense of touch (hypaesthesia), and loose or watery stools (diarrhoea).  </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
