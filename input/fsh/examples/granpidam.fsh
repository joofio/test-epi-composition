<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to sildenafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you are taking medicines containing nitrates, or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrate 
( poppers ). These medicines are often given for relief of chest pain (or  angina pectoris ). 
Granpidam can cause a serious increase in the effects of these medicines. Tell your doctor if you 
are taking any of these medicines. If you are not certain, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </li>
<li>if you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil have 
been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or 
are unsure tell your doctor. </li>
<li>if you have recently had a stroke, a heart attack or if you have severe liver disease or very low 
blood pressure (&lt;90/50 mmHg). </li>
<li>if you are taking a medicine to treat fungal infections such as ketoconazole or itraconazole or 
medicines containing ritonavir (for HIV). </li>
<li>if you have ever had loss of vision because of a problem with blood flow to the nerve in the eye 
called non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Granpidam if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a disease due to a blocked or narrow vein in the lungs rather than a blocked or narrow 
artery. </li>
<li>have a severe heart problem. </li>
<li>have a problem with the pumping chambers of your heart </li>
<li>have high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs. </li>
<li>have low blood pressure at rest. </li>
<li>lose a large amount of body fluids (dehydration) which can occur when you sweat a lot or do 
not drink enough liquids. This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhoea. </li>
<li>have a rare inherited eye disease (retinitis pigmentosa). </li>
<li>have an abnormality of red blood cells (sickle cell anaemia), cancer of blood cells (leukaemia), 
cancer of bone marrow (multiple myeloma), or any disease or deformity of the penis. </li>
<li>currently have a stomach ulcer, a bleeding disorder (such as haemophilia) or problems with nose 
bleeds. </li>
<li>take medicines for erectile dysfunction. </li>
</ul>
<p>When used to treat male erectile dysfunction (ED), the following visual side effects have been 
reported with PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil at an unknown frequency; partial, sudden, 
temporary, or permanent decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes. </p>
<p>If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Granpidam and contact your 
doctor immediately (see also section 4). </p>
<p>Prolonged and sometimes painful erections have been reported in men after taking sildenafil. If you 
have an erection, which lasts continuously for more than 4 hours, stop taking Granpidam and 
contact your doctor immediately (see also section 4). </p>
<p>Special considerations for patients with kidney or liver problems 
You should tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems, as your dose may need to be 
adjusted. </p>
<p>Children 
Granpidam should not be given to children below 1 year of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Granpidam 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines containing nitrates, or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrate ( poppers ). These 
medicines are often given for relief of angina pectoris or  chest pain  (see section 2. Do not take 
Granpidam) </li>
<li>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking riociguat. </li>
<li>Therapies for pulmonary hypertension (e.g. bosentan, iloprost) </li>
<li>Medicines containing St. John s Wort (herbal medicinal product), rifampicin (used to treat 
bacterial infections), carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital (used, among others, to treat 
epilepsy) </li>
<li>Blood thinning medicines (for example warfarin) although these did not result in any side effect. </li>
<li>Medicines containing erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin (these are antibiotics used to 
treat certain bacterial infections), saquinavir (for HIV) or nefazodone (for mental depression), as 
your dose may need to be adjusted. </li>
<li>Alpha-blocker therapy (e.g. doxazosin) for the treatment of high blood pressure or prostate 
problems, as the combination of the two medicines may cause symptoms resulting in the 
lowering of your blood pressure (e.g. dizziness, light headedness). </li>
<li>Medicines containing sacubitril/valsartan, used to treat heart failure. </li>
</ul>

baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Granpidam can cause dizziness and can affect vision. You should be aware of how you react to the 
medicine before you drive or use machines. </p>
