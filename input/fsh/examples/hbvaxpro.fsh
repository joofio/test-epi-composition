Warnings and precautions
The container of this vaccine contains latex rubber. Latex rubber may cause severe allergic reactions.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you or your child receives HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms.
Other vaccines and HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms
HBVAXPRO can be administered at the same time as with hepatitis B immunoglobulin, at a separate
injection site.
HBVAXPRO can be used to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who
have previously received another hepatitis B vaccine.
HBVAXPRO may be administered at the same time as with some other vaccines, using separate sites and
syringes.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child is taking, or has recently taken, any other
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Caution should be exercised when prescribing the vaccine to pregnant or breast-feeding women.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines 
HBVAXPRO is expected to have no, or negligible, influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms contains sodium: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol
sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium- free .</p>         </div>"""

The recommended dose for each injection (0.5 mL) is 5 micrograms for individuals from birth through
15 years of age.
A course of vaccination should include at least three injections.
Two immunisation schedules can be recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>two injections with an interval of one month followed by a third injection 6 months after the first
administration (0, 1, 6 months).</li>
<li>if immunity is needed quickly: three injections with an interval of one month and a fourth dose 1
year later (0, 1, 2, 12 months).
In case of a recent exposure to the hepatitis B virus, a first dose of HBVAXPRO together with the
appropriate dose of immunoglobulin can be given.
Some local vaccination schedules currently include recommendations for a booster dose. Your doctor,
pharmacist or nurse will inform you if a booster dose should be given.
Method of administration
The vial should be well shaken until a slightly opaque white suspension is obtained.
Once the vial has been penetrated, the withdrawn vaccine should be used promptly, and the vial must be
discarded.
The doctor or nurse will give the vaccine as an injection into muscle. The upper side of the thigh is the
preferred site for injection in neonates and infants. The upper arm muscle is the preferred site for injection
in children and adolescents.
This vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopaenia
(diminution of blood platelets) or to persons at risk of haemorrhage.
If you or your child forget one dose of HBVAXPRO 5 micrograms 
If you or your child miss a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Your doctor or
nurse will decide when to give the missed dose.
If you or your child have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or
nurse.</li>
