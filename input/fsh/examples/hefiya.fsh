  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Hefiya contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body s immune 
(defence) system. 
Hefiya is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases:</p>
<p>polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,</p>
<p>enthesitis-related arthritis</p>
<p>paediatric plaque psoriasis,</p>
<p>paediatric Crohn s disease,</p>
<p>paediatric non-infectious uveitis. 
The active substance in Hefiya, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are 
proteins that attach to a specific target in the body. 
The target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is present at 
increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF , Hefiya blocks its 
action and reduces the inflammation in these diseases.
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of 
the joints that usually first appear in childhood. 
Hefiya is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 
17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may 
first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not 
work well enough, patients will be given Hefiya to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin 
covered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, 
become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be 
caused by a problem with the body s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin 
cells.
Hefiya is also used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for 
whom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or 
are not suitable.
Paediatric Crohn s disease 
Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut.
Hefiya is used to treat moderate to severe Crohn s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 
17 years. 
Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child 
will be given Hefiya to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease.
Paediatric non-infectious uveitis 
Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation 
leads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that 
move across the field of vision). Hefiya works by reducing this inflammation.
Hefiya is used to treat children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with 
inflammation affecting the front of the eye.
Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child 
will be given Hefiya to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).</p>
<p>if your child has a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other 
opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is 
important that you tell your doctor if your child shows symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, 
wounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see  Warnings and precautions ).</p>
<p>if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child 
has had or has a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Hefiya.
Allergic reaction</p>
<p>If your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash, do not inject more Hefiya and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare 
cases, these reactions can be life-threatening.
Infection</p>
<p>If your child has an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example leg ulcer), 
consult your doctor before starting Hefiya. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.</p>
<p>Your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving Hefiya treatment. This risk 
may increase if your child s lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and 
include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual 
infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). </p>
<p>In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if your 
child shows symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may 
recommend temporarily stopping Hefiya.
Tuberculosis (TB)</p>
<p>As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor 
will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Hefiya. This will 
include a thorough medical evaluation including your child s medical history and screening tests 
(for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be 
recorded on your child s Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if 
your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if he/she has been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has had 
preventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight 
loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your 
doctor immediately.
Travel/recurrent infection</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child has a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that 
increase the risk of infections.
Hepatitis B virus</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has active 
HBV infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should 
test your child for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this 
virus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the 
immune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening.
Surgery or dental procedures</p>
<p>If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that your child is 
taking Hefiya. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Hefiya.
Demyelinating disease</p>
<p>If your child has or develops demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer 
around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he/she should receive 
or continue to receive Hefiya. Tell your doctor immediately if he/she experiences symptoms like 
changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body.
Vaccine</p>
<p>Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and 
should not be given during treatment with Hefiya in case they cause infections. Check with your 
doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be 
given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Hefiya. 
If your child receives Hefiya while she is pregnant, her baby may be at higher risk for getting an 
infection for up to about five months after the last dose she received during pregnancy. It is 
important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your child s 
Hefiya use during herpregnancy so they can decide when her baby should receive any vaccine.
Heart failure</p>
<p>It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. If your 
child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Hefiya, the heart failure status must be 
closely monitored by your doctor. If your child develops new or worsening symptoms of heart 
failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor 
immediately. 
Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale</p>
<p>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections 
or help stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, or he/she bruises or 
bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to 
stop treatment.
Cancer</p>
<p>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking 
adalimumab or other TNF  blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have 
had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and 
leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Hefiya, the risk 
of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific 
and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those 
patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if 
your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Hefiya. </p>
<p>In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking 
adalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks 
or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another 
TNF  blocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your 
doctor whether treatment with a TNF  blocker is appropriate.
Autoimmune diseases</p>
<p>On rare occasions, treatment with Hefiya could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your 
doctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur.
Children and adolescents
  Do not give Hefiya to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 
2 years.
  Do not give Hefiya to children with paediatric plaque psoriasis or paediatric ulcerative colitis below 
the age of 4 years.
  Do not give Hefiya to children with paediatric Crohn s disease below the age of 6 years.
  Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended.
Other medicines and Hefiya
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any 
other medicines.
Hefiya can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents 
(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or 
pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Your child should not take Hefiya with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or 
abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other 
TNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk 
for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you 
have questions, please ask your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue 
its use for at least 5 months after the last Hefiya treatment.</p>
<p>If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her 
doctor for advice before taking this medicine.</p>
<p>Hefiya should only be used during a pregnancy if needed.</p>
<p>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did 
not receive adalimumab.</p>
<p>Hefiya can be used during breast-feeding.</p>
<p>If your child  receives Hefiya during her pregnancy, the baby may have a higher risk for getting 
an infection. </p>
<p>It is important that you tell her baby s doctors and other health care professionals about her 
Hefiya use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on 
vaccines see the  Warnings and precautions  section).
Driving and using machines
Hefiya may have a minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning 
sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Hefiya.
Hefiya contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.4 ml dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

7. Instructions for use 
To help avoid possible infections and to ensure that you use the medicine correctly, it is important that 
you follow these instructions. 
Be sure that you read, understand, and follow these Instructions for Use before injecting Hefiya. Your 
healthcare provider should show you how to prepare and inject Hefiya properly using the pre-filled 
syringe before you use it for the first time. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions.
Your Hefiya single-use pre-filled syringe with needle guard and add-on finger flange
Figure A: Hefiya pre-filled syringe with needle guard and add-on finger flange
It is important that you:</p>
<p>do not open the outer box until you are ready to use the syringe.</p>
<p>do not use the syringe if the seals of the blister are broken, as it may not be safe for you to use. </p>
<p>never leave the syringe unattended where others might tamper with it. </p>
<p>if you drop your syringe, do not use it if it looks damaged, or if you dropped it with the needle 
cap removed.</p>
<p>do not remove the needle cap until just before you give the injection.</p>
<p>be careful not to touch the needle guard wings before use. Touching them may cause the needle 
guard to be activated too early. Do not remove the finger flange before the injection.</p>
<p>inject Hefiya 15 30 minutes after taking it out of the refrigerator for a more comfortable 
injection.</p>
<p>throw away the used syringe right away after use. Do not re-use a syringe. See  4. Disposing 
of used syringes  at the end of these Instructions for Use.
How should you store Hefiya?</p>
<p>Store your outer carton of syringes in a refrigerator, between 2 C to 8 C.</p>
<p>When needed (for example when you are travelling), Hefiya may be stored at room temperature 
(up to 25 C) for a maximum period of 21 days   be sure to protect it from light. Once removed 
from the refrigerator for room temperature storage, your pre-filled syringe must be used within 
21 days or discarded, even if it is later returned to the refrigerator. You should record the date 
when your pre-filled syringe is first removed from the refrigerator, and the date after which it 
should be discarded. </p>
<p>Keep the syringes in the original carton until ready to use to protect from light. </p>
<p>Do not store the syringes in extreme heat or cold. </p>
<p>Do not freeze the syringes.
Keep Hefiya and all medicines out of the reach of children. 
What do you need for your injection?

Figure D: needle guard is activated   do not 
use<em> In this configuration the needle guard is 
NOT ACTIVATED. * The syringe is ready for use (see 
Figure C).</em> In this configuration the needle guard 
is ACTIVATED.* DO NOT USE the syringe (see 
Figure D).
Preparing the syringe</p>
<p>For a more comfortable injection, take the blister containing the syringe out of the refrigerator 
and leave it unopened on your work surface for about 15 to 30 minutes so that it reaches room 
temperature.</p>
<p>Take the syringe out of the blister.</p>
<p>Look through the viewing window. The solution should be colourless or slightly yellowish as 
well as clear to slightly opalescent. Do not use if any particulates and/or discolorations are 
observed. If you are concerned with the appearance of the solution, then contact your pharmacist 
for assistance. </p>
<p>Do not use the syringe if it is broken or the needle guard is activated. Return the syringe and the 
package it came in to the pharmacy.</p>
<p>Look at the expiry date (EXP) on your syringe. Do not use the syringe if the expiry date has 
passed. 
Contact your pharmacist if the syringe fails any of the above mentioned checks. 
1. Choosing your injection site: </p>
<p>The recommended injection site is the front of your thighs. 
You may also use the lower abdomen, but not the area 5 cm 
around your navel (belly button) (see Figure E). </p>
<p>Choose a different site each time you give yourself an 
injection. </p>
<p>Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, 
scaly, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. If you 
have psoriasis, you should NOT inject directly into areas with 
psoriasis plaques.
Figure E: choose your injection site
2. Cleaning your injection site:</p>
<p>Wash your hands well with soap and water. </p>
<p>Using a circular motion, clean the injection site with an 
alcohol wipe. Leave it to dry before injecting (see Figure F).</p>
<p>Do not touch the cleaned area before injecting.
Figure F: clean your injection site
3. Giving your injection:</p>
<p>Carefully pull the needle cap straight off to remove it from 
the syringe (see Figure G).  </p>
<p>Discard the needle cap. </p>
<p>You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is 
normal. 
Figure G: pull the needle cap off</p>
<p>Gently pinch the skin at the injection site (see Figure H).</p>
<p>Insert the needle into your skin as shown. </p>
<p>Push the needle all the way in to ensure that the medication 
can be fully administered. 
Figure H: insert the needle</p>
<p>Hold the syringe as shown (see Figure I).</p>
<p>Slowly press down on the plunger as far as it will go, so that 
the plunger head is completely between the needle guard 
wings.</p>
<p>Keep the plunger pressed fully down while you hold the 
syringe in place for 5 seconds. 
Figure I: hold the syringe</p>
<p>Keep the plunger fully pressed down while you carefully 
lift the needle straight out from the injection site and let go 
of your skin (see Figure J). 
Figure J: lift the needle straight out</p>
<p>Slowly release the plunger and allow the needle safety guard 
to automatically cover the exposed needle (see Figure K).</p>
<p>There may be a small amount of blood at the injection site. 
You can press a cotton ball or gauze onto the injection site 
and hold it for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You 
may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, 
if needed. 
Figure K: slowly release the plunger
4. Disposing of used syringes:</p>
<p>Dispose of the used syringe in a sharps container (closable, 
puncture-resistant container). For the safety and health of 
you and others, needles and used syringes must never be 
re-used.</p>
<p>Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or 
household waste. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to 
throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures 
will help protect the environment. Any unused product or 
waste material should be disposed of in accordance with 
local requirements.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please talk to a doctor, pharmacist or nurse who is familiar with 
Hefiya.
