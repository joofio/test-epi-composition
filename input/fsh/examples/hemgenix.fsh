Hemgenix is a gene therapy product that contains the active substance etranacogene dezaparvovec. A
gene therapy product works by delivering a gene into the body to correct a genetic defect.
Hemgenix is used for the treatment of severe and moderately severe Haemophilia B (congenital 
Factor IX deficiency) in adults who do not have current or past inhibitors (neutralising antibodies)
against the Factor IX protein.
People with Haemophilia B are born with an altered form of a gene needed to make Factor IX, an 
essential protein required for blood to clot and stop any bleeding. People with Haemophilia B have 
insufficient levels of Factor IX and are prone to internal or external bleeding episodes.
How Hemgenix works
The active substance in Hemgenix is based on a virus that does not cause disease in humans. This virus 
has been modified so that it cannot spread in the body but can deliver a copy of the Factor IX gene into 
the liver cells. This allows the liver to produce the Factor IX protein and raise the levels of working 
Factor IX in the blood. This helps the blood to clot more normally and prevents or reduces bleeding 
episodes.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to etranacogene dezaparvovec or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).
-
If you suffer from an active infection which is either an acute (short-term) infection, or chronic 
(long-term) infection that is not controlled by medicines.
-
If your liver does not work properly due to advanced liver fibrosis (tissue scarring and thickening),
or cirrhosis (scarring due to long-term liver damage).
If any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure of any of the above, please talk to your doctor 
before you receive Hemgenix.
Warnings and precautions
Before the treatment with Hemgenix
Your doctor will perform several tests before you are given Hemgenix treatment.
Antibody blood tests
Your doctor will conduct blood tests to check for certain antibodies (proteins) before treatment with 
Hemgenix, including:</p>
<p>Blood tests to check for the presence of antibodies in your blood directed against the human 
Factor IX protein (Factor IX inhibitors).
If you test positive for these antibodies, another test will be performed in approximately 2 weeks. If 
both the initial test and re-test results are positive, Hemgenix administration will not be initiated.</p>
<p>Blood tests to check for the amount of antibodies in your blood directed against the type of virus
used to make Hemgenix may also be performed.
Liver health
In order to decide if this medicine is suitable for you, your doctor will check the status of your liver 
health before you start treatment with Hemgenix and perform:</p>
<p>Blood tests to check the level of liver enzyme in your blood</p>
<p>Liver ultrasound</p>
<p>Elastography testing to check for scarring or thickening of your liver.
During or shortly after Hemgenix infusion
Your doctor will monitor you during or shortly after Hemgenix infusion.
Infusion-related reactions
Infusion-related side effects can occur during or shortly after you are given the Hemgenix infusion (drip). 
Your doctor will monitor you during Hemgenix infusion and for at least 3 hours after you are given 
Hemgenix.</p>
<p>Symptoms of such side effects are listed in section 4  Possible side effects . Tell your doctor or 
nurse immediately if you experience these or any other symptoms during or shortly after the 
infusion.</p>
<p>Depending on your symptoms, your infusion may be slowed down or interrupted. If the infusion is 
interrupted, it can be restarted at a slower rate when the infusion reaction is resolved. Your doctor 
may also consider if you should be given corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone or prednisone) to help 
manage the infusion reaction.
After the treatment with Hemgenix
After treatment with Hemgenix, your doctor will continue to check your health. It is important that you 
discuss the schedule for these blood tests with your doctor so that they can be carried out as necessary.
Liver enzymes
Hemgenix will trigger a response within your immune system that could lead to an increased level of 
certain liver enzymes in your blood called transaminases (transaminitis). Your doctor will regularly 
monitor your liver enzyme levels to ensure that the medicine is working as it should:</p>
<p>In the first 3 months, at least, after you are given Hemgenix, you will have blood tests once per 
week to monitor your liver enzyme levels.<em> If you experience an increase in liver enzymes, you may have more frequent blood tests to 
check the levels of your liver enzymes, until they return to normal. You may also need to take 
another medicine (corticosteroids) to manage these side effects.</em> Your doctor may also perform additional tests to exclude other causes for the increase in your 
liver enzymes, if needed, in consultation with a doctor experienced in liver diseases.</p>
<p>Your doctor will repeat liver enzyme testing tests every three months from month 4 up to one year 
after you are given Hemgenix to continue checking of your liver health. In the second year after 
you are given Hemgenix, your doctor will follow up your liver enzymes half-yearly. After the 
second year, your doctor will check your liver enzymes annually for at least 5 years after you are 
given Hemgenix.
Factor IX levels
Your doctor will regularly check your Factor IX levels to see if treatment with Hemgenix was successful.</p>
<p>In at least the first 3 months after you are given Hemgenix, you will have blood tests once per week 
to check your Factor IX levels.</p>
<p>Your doctor will repeat these test every three months from month 4 up to 1 year after you are given 
Hemgenix to continue checking your Factor IX level. In the second year after you are given 
Hemgenix, your doctor will check your Factor IX levels half-yearly. Thereafter, your doctor will 
check them annually at least for 5 years after you are given Hemgenix.</p>
<p>If you experience an increase in liver enzymes or will need to take another medicine (e.g. 
corticosteroids), you will have more frequent blood tests to check your Factor IX levels, until your
liver enzymes return to normal or you stop taking your additional medicine.
Use of other Haemophilia treatments
After Hemgenix use, talk to your doctor about if or when you should stop your other Haemophilia 
treatments and develop a treatment plan of what to do in case of surgery, trauma, bleeds, or any 
procedures that could potentially increase the risk of bleeding. It is very important to continue your 
monitoring and doctor visits to determine if you need to take other treatments to manage Haemophilia.
Abnormal clotting of blood (thromboembolic events)
After treatment with Hemgenix, your Factor IX protein level may increase. In some patients, it could 
increase to levels above the normal range for a period of time.
-
Unusually elevated Factor IX levels may cause your blood to clot abnormally, increasing the risk 
of blood clots, such as in the lung (pulmonary thromboembolism) or in a blood vessel of the leg 
(venous or arterial thrombosis). This theoretical risk is low due to your inborn deficiency in the 
clotting cascade when compared with healthy subjects.
-
You may be at risk of abnormal blood clotting, if you have preexisting problems with your heart 
and blood vessels (e.g. a history of a heart disease (cardiovascular disease), thick and stiff arteries 
(arteriosclerosis), high blood pressure (hypertension), or if you are diabetic or above 50 years).
-
Your doctor will regularly monitor your blood for any potential abnormalities in Factor IX levels, 
in particular if you continue receiving your routine Factor IX prophylaxis (Factor IX replacement 
therapy) after Hemgenix administration (see also section 3  How to use Hemgenix ).
-
Consult your doctor immediately, if you observe signs of abnormal clotting, such as sudden chest 
pain, shortness of breath, sudden onset of muscle weakness, loss of sensation and/or balance, 
decreased alertness, difficulty in speaking, or swelling of one or both legs.
Avoiding blood donations and donations for transplantations
The active substance in Hemgenix may temporarily be excreted through your blood, semen, breast 
milk or bodily waste, a process called shedding (see also section 2  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
fertility ).
To ensure that people without Haemophilia B are not exposed to Hemgenix DNA through shedding 
process in your body and/or semen, you will not be able to donate blood, semen, or organs, tissues and 
cells for transplantation after you have been treated with Hemgenix.
Immunocompromised patients or patients with HIV or other infection
If you have problems with your immune system (are immunocompromised), are undergoing or will 
undergo a treatment suppressing your immune system, or have an HIV or other new or recent 
infection, your doctor will decide where you will be able to receive Hemgenix.
Neutralising antibodies against Factor IX proteins (Factor IX inhibitors)
Neutralising antibodies against Factor IX proteins may stop Hemgenix from working properly. Your 
doctor may check your blood for these antibodies, if your bleeds will not be controlled, or return after you 
have been given Hemgenix (see also section 3  How to use Hemgenix ).
Receiving gene therapy again in the future
After receiving Hemgenix, your immune system will produce antibodies to the shell of the 
AAV vector. It is not yet known whether or under which conditions therapy with Hemgenix may be 
repeated. It is also not yet known whether or under which conditions subsequent use of another gene 
therapy may be possible.
Risk of malignancy potentially associated with Hemgenix
-
Hemgenix will insert into liver cells and it could possibly insert into the liver cell DNA or the DNA 
of other body cells. As a consequence, Hemgenix could contribute to a risk of cancer, such as liver 
cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Although there is no evidence of this in the clinical studies so 
far, this remains possible because of the nature of the medicine. You should therefore discuss this 
with your physician.
-
If you are a patient with preexisting risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g. you have liver 
fibrosis (scarring and thickening of the liver), or Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, fatty liver (nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), or you excessively drink alcohol), your doctor will regularly (e.g. 
annually) monitor your long-term liver health for at least 5 years after Hemgenix administration 
and perform the following tests:</p>
<p>Annual liver ultrasound and</p>
<h2>Annual blood test to check for increases in so-called alpha-fetoprotein.</h2>
<p>After treatment with Hemgenix, you will be expected to enrol in a follow up study to help study the 
long-term safety of the treatment for 15 years, how well it continues to work and any side effects 
that may be linked to the treatment. In the event of cancer, your doctor may take a sample of your 
cancer (biopsy) to check if Hemgenix has inserted into the cell DNA.
Children and adolescents
Hemgenix has not been studied in children or adolescents under the age of 18. Other medicines and Hemgenix
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
If you are taking medication that are known to damage the liver (hepatotoxic medication), your doctor 
may decide that you may need to stop this medication to be able to receive Hemgenix.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
There are no data regarding Hemgenix use in women with Haemophilia B.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or plan to become pregnant, ask your 
doctor for advice prior to be given Hemgenix.
-
Hemgenix treatment is not recommended in women who are able to become pregnant. It is not yet 
known whether Hemgenix can be used safely in these patients as the effects on pregnancy and the 
unborn child are not known.
-
Hemgenix should not be used during pregnancy. It is not known whether this medicinal product 
can cause harm to your unborn baby when administered to you during your pregnancy.
-
Hemgenix should not be used during breast-feeding. It is unknown whether this medicine is 
excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
Use of contraception and avoiding partner pregnancy for a period of time
After a male patient has been treated with Hemgenix, the patient and any female partner must avoid 
pregnancy for 12 months. You should use effective contraception (e.g. barrier contraception such as 
condom or diaphragm). This is to prevent the theoretical risk that the Factor IX gene from a father s 
Hemgenix treatment is transmitted to a child with unknown consequences. For the same reason, male 
patients must not donate semen. Discuss with your doctor which methods of contraception are suitable.
Driving and using machines
Hemgenix has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Temporary dizziness, tiredness,
and headaches have occurred shortly after Hemgenix infusion. If you are affected, you should use 
caution until you are certain that Hemgenix does not adversely affect your ability to drive or use 
machines. Talk to your doctor about this.
Hemgenix contains sodium and potassium
-
The medicine contains 35.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
-
This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, that is to say 
essentially potassium-free.</p>         </div>"""

Discontinuation of exogenous Factor IX treatment
-
It may take several weeks before improved bleeding control becomes apparent after Hemgenix 
infusion, and you may need to continue your replacement therapy with exogenous Factor IX during 
the first weeks after Hemgenix infusion.
-
Your doctor will regularly monitor your blood for the Factor IX activity levels, i.e. weekly for at 
least first 3 months, and at regular intervals thereafter, and decide if and when you should receive, 
reduce, or stop your exogenous Factor IX therapy (see section 2).

<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before using.
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product
This medicinal product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
Personal protective equipment, including gloves, safety goggles, protective clothing and masks, should be 
worn while preparing and administering etranacogene dezaparvovec.
Preparation of etranacogene dezaparvovec prior to administration
1. Use aseptic techniques during the preparation and administration of etranacogene dezaparvovec.
2. Use etranacogene dezaparvovec vial(s) only once (single-use vial(s)).
3. Verify the required dose of etranacogene dezaparvovec based on the patient s body weight. The total 
number of vials in each finished pack corresponds to the dosing requirement for each individual 
patient based on the body weight.
4. Etranacogene dezaparvovec must be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection prior to administration.
-
Withdraw the volume of the calculated Hemgenix dose (in mL) from the 500 mL-infusion 
bag(s) with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. The volume to be 
withdrawn will vary based on the patient body weight.<em> For patients &lt;120 kg body weight, withdraw the volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection corresponding to the total Hemgenix dose (in mL) from 
one 500 mL-infusion bag.</em> For patients  120 kg body weight, withdrawn the volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection corresponding to the total Hemgenix dose (in mL) from two 
500 mL-infusion bags, by withdrawing half of the volume from each of the two 500 mL-
infusion bags.
-
Add subsequently the required Hemgenix dose to the infusion bag(s) to bring the total volume 
in each infusion bag back to 500 mL.
5. Add the Hemgenix dose directly into the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Do 
not add the Hemgenix dose into the air within the infusion bag during diluting.
6. Gently invert the infusion bag(s) at least 3 times to mix the solution and ensure even distribution of 
the diluted product.
7. To avoid foaming:
-
Do not shake the etranacogene dezaparvovec vial(s) and the prepared infusion bag(s).
-
Do not use filter needles during preparation of etranacogene dezaparvovec.
8. To reduce the risk of spillage and/or aerosol formation, the infusion bag(s) should be provided 
connected to an infusion tubing prefilled with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection.
9. The infusion tubing prefilled with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection
should be connected to the main intravenous infusion line also primed with sterile sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection prior to use.
10. Use only sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection since the stability of etranacogene 
dezaparvovec has not been determined with other solutions and diluents.
11. Do not infuse the diluted etranacogene dezaparvovec solution in the same intravenous line with any 
other products.
12. Do not use a central line or port.
Administration
13. Diluted etranacogene dezaparvovec should be visually inspected prior to administration. The diluted 
etranacogene dezaparvovec should be a clear, colourless solution. If particulates, cloudiness or 
discoloration are visible in the infusion bag, do not use etranacogene dezaparvovec.
14. Use the product after dilution as soon as possible. You must not exceed the storage time of the diluted 
product beyond that provided in SmPC section 6.3. 15. Use an integrated (in-line) 0.2  m filter made out of polyethersulfone (PES).
16. The diluted etranacogene dezaparvovec solution must be administered into a peripheral vein by a 
separate intravenous infusion line through a peripheral venous catheter.
17. Etranacogene dezaparvovec solution should be infused closely following the infusion rate(s) provided 
in SmPC section 4.2. The administration should be completed within  24 hours after the dose 
preparation (see SmPC section 4.2).
18. After the entire content of the infusion bag(s) is infused, the infusion line must be flushed at the same 
infusion rate with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure all etranacogene 
dezaparvovec is delivered.
Measures to take in case of accidental exposure
In case of accidental exposure local guidance for pharmaceutical waste must be followed.<em> In case of accidental exposure to eyes, immediately flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes. Do 
not use alcohol solution.</em> In case of accidental needle stick exposure, encourage bleeding of the wound and wash injection area 
well with soap and water.<em> In case of accidental exposure to skin, the affected area must be thoroughly cleaned with soap and 
water for at least 15 minutes. Do not use alcohol solution.</em> In case of accidental inhalation, move the person into fresh air.<em> In case of accidental oral exposure, abundantly rinse mouth with water.</em> In each case, obtain subsequently medical attention.
Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with etranacogene dezaparvovec 
must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant with viricidal activity (e.g. a chlorine releasing 
disinfectant like hypochlorite containing 0.1% available chlorine (1000 ppm)) after usage.
Precautions to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product
Unused medicinal product and disposable material that may have come in contact with Hemgenix (solid 
and liquid waste) must be disposed of in compliance with the local guidance for pharmaceutical waste.
The risk of an adverse effect to human health upon accidental exposure to Hemgenix and the 
environmental risks are, however, considered negligible.
Caregivers should be advised on the proper handling of waste material generated from contaminated 
medicinal ancillaries during Hemgenix use.
Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with etranacogene dezaparvovec
must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant with viricidal activity (e.g. a chlorine releasing 
disinfectant like hypochlorite containing 0.1% available chlorine (1000 ppm)) after usage and then 
autoclaved, if possible.</p>         </div>"""
