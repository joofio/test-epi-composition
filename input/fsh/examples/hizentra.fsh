Hizentra belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins 
are also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections. </p>
<p>How Hizentra works 
Hizentra contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. 
Immunoglobulins are produced by human body s immune system. They help your body to fight 
infections caused by bacteria and viruses or maintain the balance in your immune system (referred to 
as immunomodulation). The medicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins 
naturally present in your blood. </p>
<p>What Hizentra is used for 
Replacement therapy 
Hizentra is used to raise abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels 
(replacement therapy). The medicine is used in adults and children (0-18 years) in the following 
situations: </p>
<ol>
<li>Treatment of patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce 
immunoglobulins (primary immunodeficiencies). This includes conditions such as: </li>
<li>low immunoglobulin levels (hypogammaglobulinaemia) or absence of immunoglobulins 
(agammaglobulinaemia) in the blood </li>
<li>combination of low immunoglobulin levels, frequent infections and inability to produce 
adequate amounts of antibodies after vaccination (common variable immunodeficiency) </li>
<li>combination of low level or absence of immunoglobulins and absence or non-functional 
immune cells (severe combined immunodeficiency) </li>
<li>
<p>lack of certain immunoglobulin G subclasses causing recurrent infections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment of patients with low or dysfunctional immunoglobulin levels in acquired conditions 
(secondary immunodeficiency) who experience severe or recurrent infections due to a weakened 
immune system resulting from other conditions or treatments. 
Immunomodulatory therapy in CIDP patients 
Hizentra is also used in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a 
form of autoimmune disease. CIDP is characterised by chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves 
that causes muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and arms. It is believed that the 
body s defense attack underlines such inflammation, and the immunoglobulins present in Hizentra 
help to protect the nerves from being attacked (immunomodulatory therapy). </p>

<p>if you are allergic to human immunoglobulins, polysorbate 80 or L-proline. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have experienced an 
intolerance against one of these components earlier. </p>
<p>if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the amino acid 
proline in the blood). </p>
<p>into a blood vessel. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Hizentra. </p>
<p>You may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it. However, true allergic 
reactions are rare. They may occur even if you received human immunoglobulins previously and 
tolerated them well. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough of the immunoglobulin type 
A (IgA) in your blood (IgA deficiency). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if you have an immunoglobulin 
type A (IgA) deficiency. Hizentra contains residual amounts of IgA which might cause an 
allergic reaction. 
In these rare cases allergic reactions, such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see 
also section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>If you notice such signs during the infusion of Hizentra, stop the infusion and contact your 
doctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart or blood vessel disease or blood clots, have thick 
blood, or have been immobile for some time. These things may increase your risk of having a blood 
clot after using Hizentra. Also tell your doctor what drugs you are using, as some drugs, such as those 
that contain the hormone estrogen (for example, birth control pills), may increase your risk of 
developing a blood clot. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience signs and symptoms such 
as shortness of breath, chest pain, pain and swelling of a limb, weakness or numbness on one side of 
the body after receiving Hizentra. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor if you experience the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, neck 
stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting after receiving Hizentra. Your doctor 
will decide if further tests are necessary and whether Hizentra should be continued. </p>
<p>Your healthcare professional will avoid potential complications by ensuring: </p>
<p>that you are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin. 
The medicine must be infused slowly at first. The recommended infusion rate given under 
section 3  How to use Hizentra  must be closely followed. </p>
<p>that you are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period, especially if: 
* you receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time 
* you have switched from a different medicine 
* there has been a long interval (more than eight weeks) since the previous infusion. 
In these cases, it is recommended that you are monitored during the first infusion and for an 
hour afterwards. If the points above do not apply for you it is recommended that you are 
observed for at least 20 minutes after administration. 
Other medicines and Hizentra </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any 
other medicines. </p>
<p>You must not mix other medicines with Hizentra. </p>
<p>Tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with Hizentra. 
Hizentra may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and 
chicken pox. Therefore, after receiving this medicine you may have to wait up to 3 months 
before receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. In the case of measles vaccinations the 
impairment may persist for up to 1 year. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are 
breast-feeding. Your doctor will decide whether you can receive Hizentra during your 
pregnancy or while you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>No clinical studies have been performed with Hizentra in pregnant women. However, medicines that 
contain immunoglobulins have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women for years, and no 
harmful effects on the course of pregnancy or on the baby have been observed. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding and receive Hizentra, the immunoglobulins of the medicine can also be found 
in the breast milk. Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Patients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with Hizentra that might 
affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should not drive or use machines until 
these effects have disappeared. </p>
<p>Hizentra contains proline 
You must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2  What you need to know 
before you use Hizentra ). Please tell your doctor prior to treatment. </p>
<p>Other important information about Hizentra 
Blood tests 
After receiving Hizentra, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a 
certain time. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor about your treatment with Hizentra prior to any blood test. </p>
<p>Information on what Hizentra is made of 
Hizentra is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood). When medicines are 
made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent infections being 
passed on to patients. These include: 
* careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, and 
* the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. 
Manufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can 
inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also 
applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. </p>
<p>The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV, the AIDS virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (liver inflammation), and for the 
non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. <br />
It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Hizentra the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used  (see 
section 3  How to use Hizentra ). </p>
<p>Hizentra contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial/syringe, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dosage 
Your doctor will calculate the correct dose for you taking into account your weight and response to 
treatment. 
The dose or dosing interval should not be changed without consulting your doctor. 
If you think you should receive Hizentra more or less frequently, please speak to your doctor. 
If you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Replacement therapy 
Your doctor will determine whether you need a loading dose (for adults and children) of at least 1 to 
2.5 ml/kg of body weight divided over several days. Following this, maintenance doses may be given 
at repeated intervals, from daily to once every two weeks, to reach a cumulative monthly dose of about 
2 to 4 ml/kg of body weight. Your healthcare professional may adjust the dose based on your response 
to the treatment. </p>
<p>Immunomodulatory therapy 
Your doctor will initiate therapy with Hizentra 1 week after your last intravenous immunoglobulin 
infusion by administrating under the skin (subcutaneously) with a weekly dose of 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg of 
body weight. Your doctor will determine your weekly Hizentra dose. The weekly maintenance doses 
may be divided into smaller doses and administered as often as required during the week. For dosing 
every two weeks, your doctor will double the weekly Hizentra dose. Your healthcare professional may 
adjust the dose based on your response to the treatment. </p>
<p>Method and route of administration 
In case of home treatment, this will be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the 
treatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP with SCIg and in the guidance of patients for home treatment. </p>
<p>You will be instructed and trained in: 
* aseptic infusion techniques 
* the keeping of a treatment diary, and 
* measures to be taken in case of severe side effects. </p>
<p>Infusion site(s) 
* Administer Hizentra under the skin only. 
* You may infuse Hizentra into sites such as abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and lateral hip. If large 
doses are given (&gt; 50 ml), try to administer them at multiple sites.<br />
<em> You may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. Injection sites should be at least 
5 cm apart.<br />
</em> In the case, you will use a device-assisted infusion technique (e.g. pump-assisted infusion), 
more than one infusion device can be used simultaneously. 
* In the case, you will use the manual push infusion technique with a syringe, you may use only 
one infusion site per syringe. If you need to administer an additional Hizentra syringe, you must 
use a new sterile injection needle and change the infusion site. 
* The volume of product infused into a particular site may vary. </p>
<p>Infusion rate(s) 
Your doctor will determine the appropriate infusion technique and the infusion rate for you taking into 
account your individual dose, dosing frequency and product tolerability. </p>
<p>Device-assisted infusion: 
The recommended initial infusion rate is up to 20 ml/hour/site. If well-tolerated, you may gradually 
increase the infusion rate to 35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, the infusion 
rate can be increased further as per your tolerability. </p>
<p>Manual push infusion: 
The recommended initial infusion rate is up to 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site). If well-tolerated, you 
may increase the infusion rate up to 2.0 ml/min/site (120 ml/hour/site) for subsequent infusions. 
Thereafter, the infusion rate can be increased further as per your tolerability. </p>
<p>Instructions for use </p>
<p>Follow the steps below and use aseptic technique to administer Hizentra. 
1 
Clean surface 
Thoroughly clean a table or other flat surface using an antiseptic wipe. 
2 
Assemble supplies 
Place Hizentra and other supplies and equipment needed for the infusion on a clean, flat surface. 
3 
Thoroughly wash and dry hands 
4 
Check Vials 
Visually inspect Hizentra for particles in the solution or discoloration as well as expiry date before 
administering Hizentra. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or contain particles. Do not use 
solutions that have been frozen. Administer solution which is at room or body temperature. 
Once a vial has been opened, use the solution immediately. 
5 
Preparation of Hizentra for infusion </p>
<p>Clean the vial stopper   Remove the protective cap from the vial 
to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper. Clean the 
stopper with an alcohol wipe or antiseptic preparation and allow it 
to dry. </p>
<p>Transfer Hizentra to syringe for infusion   Attach a transfer 
device or needle to a sterile syringe, using aseptic technique. If 
using a transfer device (vented spike), follow the instructions 
provided by the device manufacturer. If using a needle, pull back 
on the plunger to draw air into the syringe that is comparable to 
the amount of Hizentra to be withdrawn. Then, insert the needle 
into the center of the vial stopper and, to avoid foaming, inject air 
into headspace of the vial (not into the liquid). Finally, withdraw 
the desired volume of Hizentra. When using multiple vials to 
achieve the desired dose, repeat this step. </p>
<p>6 
Prepare the tubing 
Attach the administration tubing or needle set to the syringe. Prime the tubing to eliminate all 
remaining air. 
7 
Prepare infusion site(s) 
Select the infusion site(s)   The number and location of infusion 
sites depends on the volume of the total dose. Each infusion site 
should be at least 5 cm apart. 
You may use an unlimited number of sites simultaneously. </p>
<p>Clean the infusion site(s) using an antiseptic skin preparation, 
Allow each site to dry before proceeding. </p>
<p>8 
Insert the needle 
Grasp the skin between 2 fingers and insert the needle into the 
subcutaneous tissue. </p>
<p>Secure the needle to the skin   If necessary, use gauze and tape or 
transparent dressing to hold the needle in place. </p>
<p>9 
Infuse Hizentra 
Start infusion. 
If using an infusion pump, follow the manufacturer s instructions. </p>
<p>Record the infusion 
Record the following data in your treatment diary: 
* the date of administration, 
* the batch number of the medicine, and 
* the infused volume, flow rate, the number and location of infusion sites. </p>
<p>Clean up 
Dispose of any unused product and all used administration supplies after administration in 
accordance with local requirements. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your doctor or healthcare 
professional. </p>
<p>If you use more Hizentra than you should 
If you think you have had too much Hizentra, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Hizentra 
If you think you have missed a dose, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. </p>         </div>"""
