  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Humira contains the active substance adalimumab.
Humira is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below:</p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis</p>
<p>Enthesitis-related arthritis</p>
<p>Paediatric plaque psoriasis</p>
<p>Paediatric Crohn s disease</p>
<p>Paediatric uveitis
The active ingredient in Humira, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies 
are proteins that attach to a specific target.
The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is involved in the 
immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By 
attaching to TNF , Humira decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases.
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that usually first appears 
in childhood.
Humira is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years of age. Your child 
may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not 
work well enough, your child will be given Humira to treat his/her polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis.
Your doctor will decide if Humira should be used with methotrexate or alone.
Enthesitis-related arthritis
Enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where tendons join the 
bone.
Humira is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years of age. Your child may first be 
given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well 
enough, your child will be given Humira to treat his/her enthesitis-related arthritis.
Paediatric plaque psoriasis
Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery 
scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away 
from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body s 
immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells.
Humira is used to treat severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for 
whom topical therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable.
Paediatric Crohn s disease
Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.
Humira is used to treat moderate to severe Crohn s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.
Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child
will be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease.
Paediatric uveitis
Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.
Humira is used to treat children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation 
affecting the front of the eye
This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or 
wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Humira works by reducing this inflammation.
Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child
will be given Humira to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>If your child has active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see  Warnings and precautions ). 
It is important that you tell your doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, for example, 
fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems.</p>
<p>If your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child 
has had or has a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Humira.
Allergic reactions</p>
<p>If your child gets allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash do not inject more Humira and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare 
cases, these reactions can be life threatening.
Infections</p>
<p>If your child has an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body 
(for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Humira. If you are unsure, contact 
your doctor. </p>
<p>Your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving Humira treatment. This risk 
may increase if your child has problems with his/her lungs. These infections may be serious and 
include: </p>
<p>tuberculosis</p>
<p>infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria</p>
<p>severe infection in the blood (sepsis)
In rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if your 
child gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell 
you to stop using Humira for some time.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child lives or travels in regions where fungal infections (for example, 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child has had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that 
increase the risk of infections.</p>
<p>Your child and his/her doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while your child is 
being treated with Humira. It is important to tell your doctor if your child gets symptoms of 
infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems.
Tuberculosis</p>
<p>As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Humira, your doctor will 
check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Humira. This will include 
a thorough medical evaluation including your child s medical history and appropriate screening 
tests (for example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should 
be recorded on your child s Patient Reminder Card. </p>
<p>It is very important that you tell your doctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if 
your child has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If your child 
has active tuberculosis, do not use Humira.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has received treatment for the 
prevention of tuberculosis. </p>
<p>If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack 
of energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your 
doctor immediately.
Hepatitis B</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has active HBV 
or if you think he/she might be at risk of getting HBV. </p>
<p>Your doctor should test your child for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Humira can cause 
the virus to become active again.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the 
immune system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.<br />
Surgery or dental procedure</p>
<p>If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that your 
child is taking Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. 
Demyelinating disease</p>
<p>If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer 
around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he/she should receive or 
continue to receive Humira. Tell your doctor immediately if your child experiences symptoms like 
changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body.
Vaccinations</p>
<p>Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Humira. </p>
<p>Check with your doctor before your child receives any vaccines. </p>
<p>It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for 
their age before they start treatment with Humira.</p>
<p>If your child received Humira while she was pregnant, her baby may be at higher risk for 
getting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Humira dose 
she received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other 
health care professionals about your child s Humira use during her pregnancy so they can 
decide when her baby should receive any vaccine.
Heart failure</p>
<p>If your child has mild heart failure and is being treated with Humira, his/her heart failure status 
must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had 
or has a serious heart condition. If he/she develops new or worsening symptoms of heart failure 
(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. 
Your doctor will decide if your child should receive Humira.
Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale</p>
<p>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or 
help your child to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If your child develops
a fever that does not go away, develops light bruises or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call 
your doctor right away.
Cancer</p>
<p>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking 
Humira or other TNF blockers.  </p>
<p>People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time 
may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph 
system) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).</p>
<p>If your child takes Humira the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may 
increase. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen in 
patients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-
mercaptopurine.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Humira. </p>
<p>Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira. </p>
<p>If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, 
tell your doctor.</p>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. 
If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether 
treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for your child.
Autoimmune disease</p>
<p>On rare occasions, treatment with Humira could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your 
doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur.
Other medicines and Humira
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Your child should not take Humira with medicines containing the following active substances due to 
increased risk of serious infection:
  anakinra
  abatacept.
Humira can be taken together with:
  methotrexate
  certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, 
leflunomide and injectable gold preparations)
  steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
If you have questions, please ask your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue 
its use for at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment.</p>
<p>If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor 
for advice about taking this medicine.</p>
<p>Humira should only be used during a pregnancy if needed.</p>
<p>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received Humira during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not 
receive Humira.</p>
<p>Humira can be used during breast-feeding.</p>
<p>If your child received Humira during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting 
an infection.</p>
<p>It is important that you tell her baby s doctor and other health care professionals about her Humira 
use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on vaccines 
see the  Warnings and precautions  section.
Driving and using machines
Humira may have a small effect on your child s ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning 
sensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking Humira.</p>         </div>"""
