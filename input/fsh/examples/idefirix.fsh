(your body's defences) from rejecting the donated kidney. </p>
<p>Idefirix works by breaking down a type of antibody in the body called immunoglobulin G (IgG), 
which is involved in destroying 'foreign' or harmful substances. </p>

- If you are allergic to imlifidase or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have a severe infection. 
- If you have a blood disorder called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), that results in 
blood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Infusion reactions 
Idefirix contains a protein and it can cause allergic reactions in some people. You will receive 
medicines to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. If you get any symptoms of an allergic reaction, 
such as severe rash, shortness of breath, feeling hot, flushing, during the infusion ( drip ), the infusion 
may need to be slowed down or stopped. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can 
be continued. </p>
<p>Infections 
IgG is important for protecting you against infections and since Idefirix breaks down IgG, you will 
receive antibiotics to reduce the risk of infections. </p>
<p>Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)<br />
Your body will produce new IgG antibodies, which may attack the transplanted kidney. Your doctor 
will monitor you closely and you will receive medicines to reduce the risk of rejection. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been 
studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Idefirix 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Idefirix can 
affect the way some medicines work, and the dose of these may have to be adjusted.  </p>
<p>As Idefirix breaks down IgG, IgG-based medicines may not work if given at the same time as Idefirix. 
This includes the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>basiliximab (used to prevent rejection of kidney transplants) </li>
<li>rituximab (used to treat cancers such as non-Hodgkin s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis) </li>
<li>alemtuzumab (used to treat a form of multiple sclerosis) </li>
<li>adalimumab (used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, psoriasis, Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis) </li>
<li>denosumab (used to treat osteoporosis) </li>
<li>belatacept (used to prevent rejection of kidney transplants) </li>
<li>etanercept (used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis) </li>
<li>rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) (used to prevent rejection of kidney transplants) </li>
<li>intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (used to increase abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in 
the blood or to treat inflammatory diseases such as Guillain-Barr  syndrome, Kawasaki disease 
and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Idefirix is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Talk to your doctor if you think you may be pregnant. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Idefirix passes into breast milk. You should not breast-feed if you are being 
treated with Idefirix. </p>
<p>Idefirix contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
