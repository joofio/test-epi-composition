II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to 
tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Ifirmasta prevents the binding of angiotensin-II 
to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. Ifirmasta slows 
the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.
Ifirmasta is used in adult patients
-
to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension)
-
to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory 
evidence of impaired kidney function.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6),
-
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Ifirmasta in early pregnancy 
  see pregnancy section),
-
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ifirmasta and if any of the following apply to you:
-
if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea,
-
if you suffer from kidney problems,
-
if you suffer from heart problems,
-
if you receive Ifirmasta for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may perform 
regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor kidney 
function,
-
if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes,
-
if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics,
-
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:
-
an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems,
-
aliskiren.
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals.
See also information under the heading  Do not take Ifirmasta .
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Ifirmasta is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).
Children and adolescents
This medicine should not be used in children and adolescents (&lt; 18 years) because the safety and 
efficacy have not yet been fully established.
Other medicines and Ifirmasta
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions:
-
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not 
take Ifirmasta  and  Warnings and precautions ).
You may need to have blood checks if you take:
-
potassium supplements,
-
salt substitutes containing potassium,
-
potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics),
-
medicines containing lithium,
-
repaglinide (medication used for lowering blood sugar levels).
If you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan 
may be reduced.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Ifirmasta before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Ifirmasta. Ifirmasta is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Ifirmasta is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.
Driving and using machines
Ifirmasta is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness or 
weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your 
doctor before attempting to drive or use machines.</p>         </div>"""

Method of administration
Ifirmasta is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of water). 
You can take Ifirmasta with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about the same time each 
day. It is important that you continue to take Ifirmasta until your doctor tells you otherwise.
-
Patients with high blood pressure
The usual dose is 150 mg once a day (two tablets a day). The dose may later be increased to 
300 mg (four tablets a day) once daily depending on blood pressure response.
-
Patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease
In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, 300 mg (four tablets a day) once daily 
is the preferred maintenance dose for the treatment of associated kidney disease.
The doctor may advise a lower dose, especially when starting treatment in certain patients such as 
those on haemodialysis, or those over the age of 75 years.
The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment.
Use in children and adolescents
Ifirmasta should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets, 
contact your doctor immediately.
If you take more Ifirmasta than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately.
If you forget to take Ifirmasta
If you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Some of these effects may be serious and may require medical attention.
As with similar medicines, rare cases of allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), as well as localised 
swelling of the face, lips and/or tongue have been reported in patients taking irbesartan. If you get any 
of these symptoms or get short of breath, stop taking irbesartan and contact your doctor

type 2 diabetes with kidney disease, blood tests may show an increased level of potassium.
-
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): dizziness, feeling sick/vomiting, and fatigue and 
blood tests may show raised levels of an enzyme that measures the muscle and heart function 
(creatine kinase enzyme). In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with renal 
disease, dizziness when getting up from a lying or sitting position, low blood pressure when 
getting up from a lying or sitting position, pain in joints or muscles and decreased levels of a 
protein in the red blood cells (haemoglobin) were also reported.
-
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): heart rate increased, flushing, cough, diarrhoea, 
indigestion/heartburn, sexual dysfunction (problems with sexual performance), chest pain.
Some undesirable effects have been reported since marketing of irbesartan. Undesirable effects where 
the frequency is not known are: feeling of spinning, headache, taste disturbance, ringing in the ears, 
muscle cramps, pain in joints and muscles, decreased number of red blood cells (anaemia   symptoms 
may include tiredness, headaches, being short of breath when exercising, dizziness and looking pale), 
reduced number of platelets, abnormal liver function, increased blood potassium levels, impaired renal 
function, inflammation of small blood vessels mainly affecting the skin (a condition known as 
leukocytoclastic vasculitis), severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock) and low blood sugar levels. 
Uncommon cases of jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or whites of the eyes) have also been 
reported.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
