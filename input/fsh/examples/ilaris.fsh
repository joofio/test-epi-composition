  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Ilaris is 
Ilaris contains the active substance canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a group of 
medicines called interleukin inhibitors. It blocks the activity of a substance called interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1 beta) in the body, which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases. </p>
<p>What Ilaris is used for 
Ilaris is used for treatment of the following inflammatory diseases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic fever syndromes: </li>
<li>Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), </li>
<li>Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), </li>
<li>Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), </li>
<li>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). </li>
<li>Still s disease including adult onset Still s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (SJIA) </li>
<li>Gouty arthritis </li>
</ul>
<p>More information on each of these diseases is given below. </p>
<p>Periodic fever syndromes 
Ilaris is used in adults and children aged 2 years and older to treat the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS)   this is a group of auto-inflammatory 
diseases, which include: </li>
<li>Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), </li>
<li>Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), also called chronic infantile 
neurological, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), </li>
<li>Severe forms of familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome (FCAS) / familial cold 
urticaria (FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin 
rash. </li>
<li>Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) </li>
<li>Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) also known as mevalonate kinase deficiency 
(MKD) </li>
<li>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): Ilaris is used to treat FMF. Ilaris can be used together with 
colchicine, if appropriate. </li>
</ul>
<p>In patients with periodic fever syndromes (CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF), the body produces 
too much IL-1 beta. This may cause fever, headache, fatigue, skin rash, or painful joints and muscles. 
By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may improve these symptoms. </p>
<p>Still s disease 
Ilaris is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat active Still s disease including adult-onset 
Still s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and 
older if other treatments have not worked well enough. Ilaris can be used alone or in combination with 
methotrexate. </p>
<p>Still s disease including SJIA and AOSD is an inflammatory disease that can cause pain, swelling and 
inflammation of one or more joints, as well as rash and fever. A pro-inflammatory protein called IL-1 
beta plays an important role in Still s disease inflammation. Ilaris blocks the activity of IL-1 beta, 
which may improve the signs and symptoms of Still s disease. </p>
<p>Gouty arthritis 
Ilaris is used in adults to treat the symptoms of frequent gouty arthritis attacks if other treatments have 
not worked well enough. </p>
<p>Gouty arthritis is caused by the formation of urate crystals. These crystals cause excessive production 
of IL-1 beta, which in turn can lead to sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint 
(known as a gouty arthritis attack). By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may lead to an 
improvement in these symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to canakinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have, or suspect you have, an active and severe infection. </p>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Ilaris if any of the following applies to you: </p>
<p>if you currently have an infection or if you have had repeated infections or a condition such as a 
known low level of white blood cells which makes you more likely to get infections. </p>
<p>if you have or have ever had tuberculosis or direct contact with a person with an active 
tuberculosis infection. Your doctor may check whether you have tuberculosis using a specific 
test. </p>
<p>if you have signs of a liver disorder such as yellow skin and eyes, nausea, loss of appetite, dark-
coloured urine and light-coloured stools. </p>
<p>if you need to have any vaccinations. You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of 
vaccine called a live vaccine while being treated with Ilaris (see also  Other medicines and 
Ilaris ). </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately 
- If you have ever developed an atypical, widespread rash or skin peeling after taking Ilaris. 
The serious skin reaction, DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), has 
rarely been reported in association with Ilaris treatment, predominantly in patients with systemic 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Seek medical attention immediately if you notice an atypical, 
widespread rash, which may occur in conjuction with high body temperature and enlarged 
lymph nodes. </p>
<p>Still s disease </p>
<p>Patients with Still s disease may develop a condition called macrophage activation syndrome 
(MAS), which can be life-threatening. Your doctor will monitor you for potential triggering 
factors of MAS that include infections and re-activation of the underlying Still s disease (flare). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and SJIA: Ilaris can be used in children aged 2 years and 
older. </p>
<p>Gouty arthritis: Ilaris is not recommended for children or adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ilaris 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Live vaccines: You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of vaccine called a live 
vaccine while you are being treated with Ilaris. Your doctor may want to check your vaccination 
history and give you any vaccinations that you have missed before you start treatment with 
Ilaris. If you need to be given a live vaccine after starting treatment with Ilaris, discuss this with 
your doctor. A live vaccine should normally be given 3 months after your last injection of Ilaris 
and 3 months before the next one. </p>
<p>Medicines called tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, such as etanercept, adalimumab or 
infliximab. These are used mainly in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases. They should not be 
used with Ilaris because this may increase the risk of infections. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using 
Ilaris and for at least 3 months after the last Ilaris treatment. It is important to tell your doctor if 
you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor 
will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Ilaris during pregnancy. </p>
<p>If you received canakinumab while you were pregnant, it is important that you inform the 
baby s doctor or nurse before any vaccinations are given to your baby. Your baby should not 
receive live vaccines until at least 16 weeks after you received your last dose of canakinumab 
before giving birth. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Ilaris passes into human milk. Your doctor will discuss with you the 
potential risks of taking Ilaris before breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ilaris treatment may give you a spinning sensation (dizziness or vertigo) or intense tiredness 
(asthenia). This may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel a spinning 
sensation or feel tired, do not drive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling normal again. </p>         </div>"""

<ol>
<li>Remove the caps from the Ilaris and water vials. 
Do not touch the vial stoppers. Clean the stoppers 
with the alcohol swab. </li>
<li>Open the wrappers containing the syringe and the 
transfer needle (the 50 mm needle) and attach the 
needle to the syringe. </li>
<li>Carefully remove the cap from the transfer needle 
and set the cap aside. Pull the plunger all the way 
down to the 1.0 ml mark, filling the syringe with 
air. Insert the needle into the water vial through the 
centre of the rubber stopper. </li>
<li>Gently push the plunger all the way down until air 
is in the vial. </li>
<li>Turn the vial and syringe upside down and bring to 
eye level. </li>
<li>Make sure the tip of the transfer needle is covered 
by the water and slowly pull the syringe plunger 
down to slightly past the 1.0 ml mark. If you see 
bubbles in the syringe, remove bubbles as 
instructed by your healthcare professional or 
pharmacist. </li>
<li>
<p>Make sure 1.0 ml of water is in the syringe, then 
take the needle out of the vial. (There will be water 
remaining in the vial.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert the transfer needle through the centre of the 
stopper of the vial of Ilaris powder, taking care not 
to touch the needle or the stopper. Slowly inject the 
water into the vial containing the Ilaris powder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully remove the transfer needle from the vial 
and recap the needle as instructed by your 
healthcare provider or pharmacist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without touching the rubber stopper, swirl (do not 
shake) the vial slowly at an angle of about 
45 degrees for about 1 minute. Allow to stand for 
5 minutes. </p>
</li>
<li>Now, gently turn the vial upside down and back 
again ten times, again taking care not to touch the 
rubber stopper. </li>
<li>Allow to stand for about 15 minutes at room 
temperature to get a clear to opalescent solution. 
Do not shake. Do not use if particles are present in 
the solution. </li>
<li>Make sure all of the solution is in the bottom of the 
vial. If drops remain on the stopper, tap the side of 
the vial to remove them. The solution should be 
clear to opalescent and free of visible particles. The 
solution should be colourless or may have a slight 
brownish-yellow tint. </li>
<li>If not used immediately after mixing, the 
solution should be stored in the refrigerator 
(2 C to 8 C) and used within 24 hours. </li>
</ol>
<p>Preparing the injection </p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the rubber stopper of the vial containing the 
Ilaris solution with a new alcohol swab. </li>
<li>
<p>Uncap the transfer needle again. Pull the plunger of 
the syringe all the way down to the 1.0 ml mark, 
filling the syringe with air. Insert the syringe 
needle into the vial of Ilaris solution through the 
centre of the rubber stopper. The needle should not 
be in the liquid at this point. Gently push the 
plunger all the way down until all of the air is 
injected into the vial. Do not inject air into the 
liquid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not turn the vial and syringe upside down, the 
vial should stay upright. Insert the needle all the 
way into the vial until it reaches the bottom edge. </p>
</li>
<li>Tip the vial to ensure that the required amount of 
solution can be drawn into the syringe </li>
<li>NOTE: The required amount depends on the dose 
to be administered. Your healthcare provider will 
instruct you on the right amount for you. </li>
<li>Slowly pull the syringe plunger up to the correct 
mark (amount to be given), filling the syringe with 
Ilaris solution. If there are air bubbles in the 
syringe, remove bubbles as instructed by your 
healthcare provider. Ensure that the correct amount 
of solution is in the syringe. </li>
<li>Remove the syringe and needle from the vial. 
(There may be solution remaining in the vial.) 
Recap the transfer needle as instructed by your 
healthcare provider or pharmacist. Remove the 
transfer needle from the syringe. Place the transfer 
needle in the sharps container. </li>
<li>Open the wrapper containing the injection needle 
and attach the needle to the syringe. Set the syringe 
aside. </li>
</ol>
<p>Giving the injection </p>
<ol>
<li>Choose an injection site on the upper thigh, 
abdomen, upper arm or buttocks. Do not use an 
area that has a rash or broken skin, or is bruised or 
lumpy. Do not inject into scar-tissue as this may 
mean you do not get all of your medicine. Avoid 
injecting into a vein. </li>
<li>Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab. 
Allow the area to dry. Uncap the injection needle. </li>
<li>
<p>Gently pinch the skin up at the injection site. Hold 
the syringe at a 90-degree angle and in a single, 
smooth motion, push the needle straight down 
completely into the skin. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the needle all the way in the skin while 
slowly pushing the syringe plunger down until the 
barrel is empty. Release the pinched skin and pull 
the needle straight out. Dispose of the needle and 
syringe in the sharps container without recapping 
or removing the needle. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After the injection </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not rub the injection area. If bleeding occurs, 
apply a clean, dry cotton swab over the area, and 
press gently for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bleeding 
stops. Then apply an adhesive plaster. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safely dispose of needles and syringe in the sharps 
container or as directed by your healthcare provider 
or pharmacist. Never re-use syringes or needles. </p>
</li>
<li>Properly dispose of vials containing remaining 
water and Ilaris solution (if any) as directed by 
your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Any 
unused product or waste material should be 
disposed of in accordance with local requirements. </li>
</ol>
<p>Keep the sharps container out of reach of children. </p>
<p>Dispose of it as directed by your healthcare provider or 
pharmacist. </p>
