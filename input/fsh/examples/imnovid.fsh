  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Imnovid is 
Imnovid contains the active substance  pomalidomide . This medicine is related to thalidomide and 
belongs to a group of medicines which affect the immune system (the body s natural defences). </p>
<p>What Imnovid is used for 
Imnovid is used to treat adults with a type of cancer called  multiple myeloma . </p>
<p>Imnovid is either used with: 
* two other medicines - called  bortezomib  (a type of chemotherapy medicine) and 
 dexamethasone  (an anti-inflammatory medicine) in people who have had at least one other 
treatment - including lenalidomide.  </p>
<p>Or 
*  one other medicine - called  dexamethasone  in people whose myeloma has become worse, 
despite having at least two other treatments - including lenalidomide and bortezomib. </p>
<p>What is multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain type of white blood cell (called the 
 plasma cell ). These cells grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow. This results in 
damage to the bones and kidneys. </p>
<p>Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, treatment can reduce the signs and symptoms 
of the disease, or make them disappear for a period of time. When this happens, it is called  response . </p>
<p>How Imnovid works 
Imnovid works in a number of different ways: 
* by stopping the myeloma cells developing 
* by stimulating the immune system to attack the cancer cells 
* by stopping the formation of blood vessels supplying the cancer cells. </p>
<p>The benefit of using Imnovid with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
When Imnovid is used with bortezomib and dexamethasone, in people who have had at least one other 
treatment, it can stop multiple myeloma getting worse: 
  On average, Imnovid when used with bortezomib and dexamethasone stopped multiple 
myeloma from coming back for up to 11 months - compared with 7 months for those patients 
who only used bortezomib and dexamethasone. </p>
<p>The benefit of using Imnovid with dexamethasone<br />
When Imnovid is used with dexamethasone, in people who have had at least two other treatments, it 
can stop multiple myeloma getting worse: 
* On average, Imnovid when used with dexamethasone stopped multiple myeloma from coming 
back for up to 4 months - compared with 2 months for those patients who used only 
dexamethasone. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Imnovid: 
* if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant   this is 
because Imnovid is expected to be harmful to an unborn child. (Men and women taking this 
medicine must read the section  Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding   information for 
women and men  below). 
* if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you 
from becoming pregnant (see  Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding   information for 
women and men ). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each 
prescription that the necessary measures have been taken and will provide you with this 
confirmation. 
* if you are allergic to pomalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>If you are uncertain whether any of the conditions above apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist 
or nurse before taking Imnovid. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Imnovid if: 
* you have ever had blood clots in the past. During the treatment with Imnovid you have an 
increased risk of getting blood clots in your veins and arteries. Your doctor may recommend 
you take additional treatments (e.g. warfarin) or lower the dose of Imnovid to reduce the chance 
that you get blood clots.<br />
* you have ever had an allergic reaction such as rash, itching, swelling, feeling dizzy or trouble 
breathing while taking related medicines called  thalidomide  or  lenalidomide . 
* you have had a heart attack, have heart failure, have difficulty breathing, or if you smoke, have 
high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels. 
* you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your bone marrow. This 
could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels of chemicals 
in the blood which can lead to kidney failure. You may also experience an uneven heartbeat. 
This condition is called tumour lysis syndrome. 
* you have or have had neuropathy (nerve damage causing tingling or pain in your hands or feet). 
* you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection. Treatment with Imnovid may cause the 
hepatitis B virus to become active again in patients who carry the virus, resulting in a recurrence 
of the infection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection. 
* you experience or have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following 
symptoms: rash on face or extended rash, red skin, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged 
lymph nodes (signs of severe skin reaction called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) or drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
(TEN) or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). See also section 4  Possible side effects ).  </p>
<p>It is important to note that patients with multiple myeloma treated with pomalidomide may develop 
additional types of cancer, therefore your doctor should carefully evaluate the benefit and risk when 
you are prescribed this medicine. </p>
<p>At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you: experience 
blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way 
you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of 
sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal 
brain condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these 
symptoms prior to treatment with Imnovid, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. </p>
<p>At the end of the treatment you should return all unused capsules to the pharmacist. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding   information for women and men 
The following must be followed as stated in the Imnovid Pregnancy Prevention Programme. 
Women and men taking Imnovid must not become pregnant or father a child. This is because 
pomalidomide is expected to harm the unborn baby. You and your partner should use effective 
methods of contraception while taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Women 
Do not take Imnovid if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become 
pregnant. This is because this medicine is expected to harm the unborn baby. Before starting the 
treatment, you should tell your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if you think this is 
unlikely. </p>
<p>If you are able to become pregnant: 
* you must use effective methods of contraception for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment, 
for the whole time you are taking treatment, and until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment. 
Talk to your doctor about the best method of contraception for you. 
* each time your doctor writes a prescription for you, he will ensure you understand the necessary 
measures that have to be taken to prevent pregnancy. 
* your doctor will arrange pregnancy tests before treatment, at least every 4 weeks during 
treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the treatment has finished. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant despite the prevention measures: 
* you must stop the treatment immediately and talk to your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if Imnovid passes into human breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or 
intend to breast-feed. Your doctor will advise if you should stop or continue breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Men 
Imnovid passes into human semen. </p>
<ul>
<li>If your partner is pregnant or able to become pregnant, you must use condoms for the whole 
time you are taking treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. </li>
<li>If your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking Imnovid, tell your doctor straight away. 
Your partner should also tell her doctor straight away. </li>
</ul>
<p>You should not donate semen or sperm during treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. </p>
<p>Blood donation and blood tests 
You should not donate blood during treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. 
Before and during the treatment with Imnovid you will have regular blood tests. This is because your 
medicine may cause a fall in the number of blood cells that help fight infection (white cells) and in the 
number of cells that help to stop bleeding (platelets). </p>
<p>Your doctor should ask you to have a blood test: 
* before treatment 
* every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment 
* at least every month after that for as long as you are taking Imnovid. </p>
<p>As a result of these tests, your doctor may change your dose of Imnovid or stop your treatment. The 
doctor may also change the dose or stop the medicine because of your general health. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Imnovid is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Imnovid 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Imnovid can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other 
medicines can affect the way Imnovid works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Imnovid if you are taking any of the 
following medicines: 
* some antifungals such as ketaconazole 
* some antibiotics (for example ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) 
* certain antidepressants such as fluvoxamine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some people feel tired, dizzy, faint, confused or less alert when taking Imnovid. If this happens to you, 
do not drive or operate tools or machinery. </p>
<p>Imnovid contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

short of breath and you are also more likely to get infections. 
* Decreased number of lymphocytes (one type of white blood cells) often caused by infection 
(lymphopenia). 
* Low blood levels of magnesium (hypomagnesaemia), which may cause tiredness, generalised 
weakness, muscle cramps, irritability and may result in low blood levels of calcium 
(hypocalcaemia), which may cause numbness and, or tingling of hands, feet, or lips, muscle 
cramps, muscle weakness, light-headedness, confusion.
