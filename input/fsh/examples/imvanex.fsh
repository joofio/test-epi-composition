produce its own protection in the form of antibodies against the smallpox, monkeypox and vaccinia 
viruses.

substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) or chicken protein,
benzonase, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin which may be present in the vaccine in very small
amounts.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving IMVANEX: </p>
<p>if you have atopic dermatitis (see section 4).</p>
<p>if you have HIV infection or any other condition or treatment leading to a weakened immune
system.
The protective efficacy of IMVANEX against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia 
virus has not been studied in humans. 
In case of illness with high temperature, your doctor will postpone the vaccination until you are 
feeling better. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require postponement of 
the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first. 
IMVANEX may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. 
Prior vaccination with IMVANEX may modify the cutaneous response ( take ) to subsequently 
administered replication-competent smallpox vaccine resulting in a reduced or absent take. 
Other medicines or vaccines and IMVANEX 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or if you have 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are a pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
to your doctor for advice. The use of this vaccine during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not 
recommended. However, your doctor will assess whether the possible benefit in terms of preventing 
smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus would outweigh the potential risks to you 
and your foetus/baby.<br />
Driving and using machines 
There is no information on the effect of IMVANEX on your ability to drive or use machines. 
However, it is possible that if you experience any of the side effects listed in section 4, then some of 
these may affect your ability to drive or use machines (e.g. dizziness). 
IMVANEX contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
