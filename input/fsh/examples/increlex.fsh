-
It is used to treat children and adolescents from 2 to 18 years old who are very short for their 
age because their bodies do not make enough IGF-1. This condition is called primary IGF-1

section 6). 
-
in premature babies or neonates because it contains benzyl alcohol.
Warnings and precautions 
There is an increased risk of tumours and growths (both cancerous and non-cancerous) in children and 
adolescents treated with INCRELEX.  If any new growth, skin lesion or any unexpected symptom 
occurs during treatment or after treatment, see your doctor immediately since mecasermin may play a 
role in cancer development.<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using INCRELEX
-
if you have a curved spine (scoliosis). You should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. 
-
if you develop a limp or hip or knee pain 
-
if you have enlarged tonsils (tonsillar hypertrophy). You should have examinations periodically. 
- if you have symptoms of increased pressure in the brain (intracranial hypertension), such as 
visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting, contact the doctor for advice. 
- if you have a localised reaction at the injection site or generalised allergic reaction with 
INCRELEX. Call the doctor as soon as possible if you get a localised rash. Get medical help 
immediately if you have a generalised allergic reaction (hives, trouble breathing, faintness or 
collapse and feeling generally unwell). 
- if you have finished growing (the bone growth plates are closed). In this case INCRELEX 
cannot help you grow and should not be used. </p>
<p>Children under 2 years old </p>
<p>The use of this medicine has not been studied in children under 2 years of age and is therefore not 
recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and INCRELEX </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Especially tell the doctor if you take insulin or other anti-diabetes medicines. A dose adjustment may 
be needed for these medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>A negative pregnancy test is recommended for all women of child bearing potential prior to treatment 
with mecasermin. It is also recommended that all women of childbearing potential use adequate 
contraception during treatment. </p>
<p>Mecasermin therapy should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs. </p>
<p>Mecasermin should not be administered to a breast-feeding mother. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Mecasermin may cause hypoglycaemia (very common side effect, see section 4) that may impair your 
ability to drive and use machines because your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced. </p>
<p>You should avoid engaging in any high-risk activities (e.g., driving, etc.) within 2-3 hours after 
dosing, particularly at the start of INCRELEX treatment, until a dose of INCRELEX has been found 
which does not cause side effects that make these activities risky. </p>
<p>INCRELEX contains benzyl alcohol and sodium </p>
<p>INCRELEX contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative which may cause toxic reactions and allergic 
reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

you are not sure. 
The typical dose is 0.04 to 0.12 mg/kg of patient weight administered twice a day. See the 
 Instructions for Use  at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Inject INCRELEX just under your skin shortly before or after a meal or snack because it may have 
insulin-like hypoglycaemic effects and so it may decrease blood sugar levels (see hypoglycaemia in 
section 4). Do not inject your dose of INCRELEX if you cannot eat for any reason. Do not make up 
the missed dose by giving two doses the next time. The next dose should be taken as usual, with a 
meal or snack. </p>
<p>Inject INCRELEX just below the skin in your upper arm, upper leg (thigh), stomach area (abdomen), 
or buttocks. Change the injection site for each injection. Never inject it into a vein or muscle.  </p>
<p>Only use INCRELEX that is clear and colourless. </p>
<p>Treatment with mecasermin is a long-term therapy. For further information ask the doctor. </p>
<p>If you use more INCRELEX than you should </p>
<p>Mecasermin, like insulin, may lower blood sugar levels (see hypoglycaemia in section 4). </p>
<p>If more INCRELEX than recommended was injected, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Acute overdose could lead to hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).  </p>
<p>Treatment of acute overdose of mecasermin should be directed at reversing hypoglycaemia. Sugar-
containing fluids or food should be consumed. If the patient is not awake or alert enough to drink 
sugar-containing fluids, an injection of glucagon into the muscle may be necessary to reverse the low 
blood sugar. Your doctor or nurse will instruct you how to give the injection of glucagon. </p>
<p>Long-term overdose may result in enlargement of certain body parts (e.g., hands, feet, parts of the 
face) or excessive growth of the whole body. If you suspect long-term overdose, contact your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to use INCRELEX </p>
<p>Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If a dose is skipped, the next dose should not be made larger to compensate. The next dose should be 
taken as usual, with a meal or snack. </p>
<p>If you stop using INCRELEX </p>
<p>A disruption or early ending of treatment with mecasermin may impair the success of the growth 
therapy. Please ask the doctor for advice before stopping the treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you get 
any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in 
this leaflet. </p>
<p>The most frequently occurring side effects with mecasermin are: low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), 
vomiting, injection site reactions, headache and middle ear infections. Serious allergic reactions have 
also been reported with INCRELEX. If you develop any of these events, please follow the advice 
given for each event in the sections below.  </p>
<p>Frequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
Cancerous and non-cancerous tumours 
An increase in both cancerous and non-cancerous tumours has been reported in patients treated with 
INCRELEX.  The risk of such tumours may be higher if INCRELEX is used for condition other than 
what is stated in Section 1 or used at higher than recommended dose as per Section 3. Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) 
Generalised hives, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, swelling of the face and/or throat have been 
reported following mecasermin use. Stop INCRELEX immediately and seek urgent medical advice if 
you develop a serious allergic reaction. 
Local allergic reactions at the injection site (itching, hives) have also been reported. </p>
<p>Hair loss (alopecia) 
Hair loss has also been reported following mecasermin use. </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)<br />
Mecasermin may lower blood sugar levels. Signs of low blood sugar are: dizziness, tiredness, 
restlessness, hunger, irritability, trouble concentrating, sweating, nausea and fast or irregular 
heartbeats.  </p>
<p>Severe hypoglycaemia may cause unconsciousness, seizures/fits or death. Stop INCRELEX 
immediately and seek urgent medical advice if you develop seizures/fits or become unconscious.  </p>
<p>If you take INCRELEX, you should avoid participating in high risk activities (such as vigorous 
physical activity) within 2 to 3 hours after INCRELEX injection, especially at the beginning of 
INCRELEX treatment. </p>
<p>Before beginning treatment with INCRELEX the doctor or nurse will explain to you how to treat 
hypoglycaemia. You should always have a source of sugar such as orange juice, glucose gel, sweets, 
or milk available in case symptoms of hypoglycaemia occur. For severe hypoglycaemia, if you are not 
responsive and cannot drink sugar-containing fluids, you should give an injection of glucagon. The 
doctor or nurse will instruct you how to give the injection. Glucagon raises the blood sugar when it is 
injected. It is important that you have a well-balanced diet including protein and fat such as meat and 
cheese in addition to sugar-containing foods. </p>
<p>You should be monitored at fingertip for blood sugar (glucose) before each meal at treatment initiation 
and until a well-tolerated dose is established. If frequent symptoms of hypoglycaemia or severe 
hypoglycaemia occur, blood sugar monitoring should continue regardless of eating condition and if 
possible, in case of hypoglycaemic symptoms.  </p>
<p>Injection site hypertrophy (tissue at injection site increases in size) and bruising 
These can be avoided by changing the injection site at each injection (injection site rotation).  </p>
<p>Digestive system<br />
Vomiting and pain in the upper belly have occurred with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Infections 
Infections of the middle ear have been observed in children with mecasermin treatment.  </p>
<p>Musculoskeletal system 
Joint pains and pains in the limbs have occurred with mecasermin treatment.  </p>
<p>Nervous system 
Headache has occurred with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
Seizures 
Seizures (fits) have been observed with mecasermin treatment. 
Dizziness and tremor have also been reported with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Heart abnormalities<br />
A fast heart rate and abnormal heart sounds have been reported with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Increased blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
Increased blood sugar has also been observed with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Enlarged tonsils/adenoids 
Mecasermin may enlarge your tonsils/adenoids. Some signs of enlarged tonsils/adenoids include: 
snoring, difficulty breathing or swallowing, sleep apnoea (a condition where breathing stops briefly 
during sleep), or fluid in the middle ear, as well as infections of the ear. Sleep apnea can cause 
excessive daytime sleepiness. Call the doctor should these symptoms bother you. The doctor should 
regularly examine your tonsils/adenoids.  </p>
<p>Enlarged thymus 
An enlarged thymus (a specialized organ of the immune system) has been observed with mecasermin 
treatment. </p>
<p>Papilloedema 
A swelling at the back of the eye (due to increased pressure within the brain) may be observed by a 
doctor or optician during mecasermin treatment.  </p>
<p>Hypoacusis (hearing loss) 
Hypoacusis (hearing loss), ear pain and fluid in the middle ear have been observed with mecasermin 
treatment. Tell the doctor if you develop hearing problems. </p>
<p>Worsened scoliosis (caused by rapid growth) 
If you have scoliosis, you will need to be checked often for an increase in the curve of the spine.<br />
Pain in muscles has also been seen with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Reproductive system 
Breast enlargement has been observed with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Digestive system<br />

<p>Reactions at the injection site 
Reactions including pain, irritation, bleeding, bruising, redness and hardening have been reported with 
INCRELEX treatment. Injection site reactions can be avoided by changing the injection site at each 
injection (injection site rotation). </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)<br />
Increased pressure in the brain (intracranial hypertension) 
INCRELEX can sometimes cause a temporary increase in pressure within the brain. The symptoms of 
intracranial hypertension can include visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting. Tell the 
doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms. Your doctor can check to see if intracranial 
hypertension is present. If it is present, your doctor may decide to temporarily reduce or discontinue 
mecasermin therapy. Mecasermin may be started again after the episode is over.  </p>
<p>Heart abnormalities 
In some patients treated with mecasermin, an ultrasound examination of the heart (echocardiogram) 
showed an increased size of the heart muscle and abnormalities of heart valve function. Your doctor 
may perform an echocardiogram before, during and after mecasermin treatment.  </p>
<p>Reactions at the injection site 
Reactions including rash, swelling and fatty lumps have been reported with INCRELEX treatment. 
Injection site reactions can be avoided by changing the injection site at each injection (injection site 
rotation). </p>
<p>Weight increase 
Weight increase has been observed with mecasermin treatment. </p>
<p>Other uncommon side effects seen with mecasermin treatment include depression, nervousness. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects
