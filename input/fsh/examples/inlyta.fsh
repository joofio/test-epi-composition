<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before taking Inlyta </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have high blood pressure. 
Inlyta can raise your blood pressure. It is important to check your blood pressure before you 
take this medicine, and regularly while you are taking it. If you have high blood pressure 
(hypertension) you may be treated with medicines to reduce the blood pressure. Your doctor 
should make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting Inlyta treatment, and 
while on treatment with this medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have thyroid gland problems. 
Inlyta can cause thyroid gland problems. Tell your doctor if you get tired more easily, generally 
feel colder than other people, or your voice deepens whilst taking this medicine. Your thyroid 
function should be checked before you take Inlyta and regularly while you are taking it. If your 
thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone before, or while on treatment with this 
medicine, you should be treated with thyroid hormone replacement. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have had a recent problem with blood clots in your veins and arteries (types of 
blood vessels), including stroke, heart attack, embolism, or thrombosis.<br />
Get emergency help right away and call your doctor if you get symptoms such as chest pain or 
pressure; pain in your arms, back, neck or jaw; shortness of breath; numbness or weakness on 
one side of your body; trouble talking; headache; vision changes; or dizziness while on 
treatment with this medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you suffer from bleeding problems. 
Inlyta may increase your chance of bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding, 
coughing up of blood or bloody sputum while on treatment with this medicine.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) 
or a tear in a blood vessel wall. </p>
</li>

<p>If during treatment with this medicine you get severe stomach (abdominal) pain or 
stomach pain that does not go away. 
Inlyta may increase the risk of developing a hole in the stomach or intestine or formation of 
fistula (abnormal tube-like passage from one normal body cavity to another body cavity or the 
skin). 
Tell your doctor if you have severe abdominal pain while on treatment with this medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are going to have an operation or if you have an unhealed wound.

healing. Your treatment with this medicine should be restarted when the wound has adequately 
healed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If during treatment with this medicine, you get symptoms such as headache, confusion, 
seizures (fits), or changes in vision with or without high blood pressure. 
Get emergency help right away and call your doctor. This could be a rare neurological side 
effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.  </p>

Your doctor should do blood tests to check your liver function before and during treatment with 
Inlyta. </p>

<li>
