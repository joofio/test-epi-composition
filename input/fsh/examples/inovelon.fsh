adults, adolescents and children from 1 year of age. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is the name given to a 
group of severe epilepsies in which you may experience repeated seizures of various types.

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if:
-
you have Congenital Short QT Syndrome or a family history of such a syndrome (electrical
disturbance of the heart), as taking rufinamide could make it worse.
-
you suffer from liver problems. There is limited information on the use of rufinamide in this 
group, so the dose of your medicine may need to be increased more slowly. If your liver disease 
is severe the doctor may decide Inovelon is not recommended for you.
-
you get a skin rash or fever. These could be signs of an allergic reaction. See the doctor 
immediately as very occasionally this may become serious.
-
you suffer an increase in the number or severity or duration of your seizures, you should contact 
the doctor immediately if this happens.
-
you experience difficulty walking, abnormal movement, dizziness or sleepiness inform the 
doctor, if any of these happen.
-
if you take this medicine and have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact 
your doctor or go to a hospital straight away (see section 4).
Consult the doctor, even if these events occurred at any time in the past.
Children
Inovelon should not be given to children younger than 1 year of age since there is not enough 
information on its use in this age group.
Other medicines and Inovelon
Tell the doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. If you are taking the following medicines: phenobarbital, 
fosphenytoin, phenytoin or primidone, you may need to be carefully monitored for two weeks at the 
start of, or after the end of treatment with rufinamide, or after any marked change in the dose. A 
change in the dose of the other medicines may be needed as they may become slightly less effective 
when given with rufinamide.
Antiepileptic medicines and Inovelon
If the doctor prescribes or recommends an additional treatment for epilepsy (e.g., valproate) you must 
tell the doctor you are taking Inovelon as the dose may need adjusting.
Adults and children taking valproate at the same time as rufinamide will result in high levels of
rufinamide in the blood. Tell your doctor if you are taking valproate as the dose of Inovelon may need 
to be reduced by your doctor.
Tell the doctor if you are taking hormonal/oral contraceptives, e.g.,  The pill . Inovelon may make the 
pill not effective at preventing pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that you use an additional 
safe and effective contraceptive method (such as a barrier method, e.g., condoms) when taking 
Inovelon.
Tell the doctor if you are taking the blood thinner   warfarin. The doctor may need to adjust the dose.
Tell the doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat heart conditions). The doctor may 
need to adjust the dose.
Inovelon with food and drink
See section 3    How to use Inovelon  for advice on taking Inovelon with food and drink.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant, or think you might be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant, ask the doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking Inovelon. You must only take Inovelon during your pregnancy if 
the doctor tells you to.
You are advised not to breast-feed while taking Inovelon, as it is not known if rufinamide will be 
present in breast milk.
If you are a woman of childbearing age, you must use contraceptive measures while taking Inovelon.
Ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine at the same time as Inovelon.
Driving and using machines
Inovelon may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of 
treatment or after a dose increase. If this happens to you, do not drive or operate machinery.
Inovelon contains lactose
If you have been told by the doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact the doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.
Inovelon contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per daily dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

If you take more Inovelon than you should
If you may have taken more Inovelon than you should, tell the doctor or pharmacist immediately, or
