  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and 
hydrochlorothiazide.  Irbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor 
antagonists.  Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels 
causing them to tighten.  This results in an increase in blood pressure.  Irbesartan prevents the binding of 
angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower.<br />
Hydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased urine 
output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. 
The two active ingredients in Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva work together to lower blood pressure 
further than if either was given alone. </p>
<p>Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva is used to treat high blood pressure,  when treatment with 
irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. </p>         </div>"""

particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. 
* if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) <br />
</em> if your suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the hormone 
aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood pressure) <br />
* if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you  <br />
  have diabetes-related kidney problems. </li>
<li>aliskiren </li>
<li>if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the 
risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun 
exposure and UV rays while taking Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva  </li>
<li>if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing after taking Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva, seek medical attention 
immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) 
in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading  Do not take Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva .  </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.  Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 
Teva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, 
as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). </p>
<p>You should also tell your doctor: 
* if you are on a low-salt diet 
* if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle pain or 
cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an excessive effect of 
hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva). <br />
* if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn (such as 
redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal 
* if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics 
* if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking 
Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva. This could be a sign of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer 
of the eye (choroidal effusion) or that you are developing glaucoma, increased pressure in your eye(s). 
You should discontinue Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva treatment and seek medical attention. </p>
<p>The hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping test. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). If a 
child swallows some tablets, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,  have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>

<p>If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take 
Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva  and  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>Diuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiaizde Teva may have 
an effect on other medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with

<p>You may need to have blood checks if you take: 
<em><br />
potassium supplements

steroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers, arthritis medicines, or colestyramine and colestipol resins for 
lowering blood cholesterol. </p>

Due to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva, if you drink alcohol while 
on treatment with this medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, especially 
when getting up from a sitting position.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise 
you to stop taking Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know 
you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 
Teva. Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva is not recommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken 
when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month 
of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide 
Teva is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment 
for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide Teva is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, 
occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience 
these, talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines.  </p>
