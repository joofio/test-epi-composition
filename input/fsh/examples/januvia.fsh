DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) that lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
This medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal and decreases the amount
of sugar made by the body. 
Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to help lower your blood sugar, which is too high because of
your type 2 diabetes. This medicine can be used alone or in combination with certain other medicines
(insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones) that lower blood sugar, which you may already be
taking for your diabetes together with a food and exercise plan.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that
your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar.
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems
like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving Januvia
(see section 4).
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid.
Your doctor may ask you to stop Januvia.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had:</p>
<ul>
<li>a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis)</li>
<li>gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of fat) in your blood.
These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis (see section 4).</li>
<li>type 1 diabetes</li>
<li>diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss,
nausea or vomiting)</li>
<li>any past or present kidney problems</li>
<li>an allergic reaction to Januvia (see section 4)
This medicine is unlikely to cause low blood sugar because it does not work when your blood sugar is
low. However, when this medicine is used in combination with a sulphonylurea medicine or with
insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your
sulphonylurea or insulin medicine.
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not use this medicine. It is not effective in children
and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and
effective when used in children younger than 10 years.
Other medicines and Januvia
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heartbeat and
other heart problems). The level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if taking with
Januvia.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
You should not take this medicine during pregnancy.
It is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. You should not take this medicine if you are
breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However,
dizziness and drowsiness have been reported, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.
Taking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause
hypoglycaemia, which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work without safe
foothold.
Januvia contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .</li>
