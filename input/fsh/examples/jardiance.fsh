Jardiance contains the active substance empagliflozin.
Jardiance is a member of a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
What Jardiance is used for
Type 2 diabetes mellitus</p>
<p>Jardiance is used to treat type 2 diabetes in adults and children aged 10 years and older that 
cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone. </p>
<p>Jardiance can be used without other medicines in patients who cannot take metformin (another 
diabetes medicine).</p>
<p>Jardiance can also be used with other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. These may be 
medicines taken by mouth or given by injection such as insulin.
Jardiance works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar (glucose) to 
be removed in your urine. Thereby Jardiance lowers the amount of sugar in your blood.
This medicine can also help prevent heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
It is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as told by your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.
Heart failure</p>
<p>Jardiance is used to treat heart failure in adult patients with symptoms due to impaired heart 
function.
Chronic kidney disease</p>
<p>Jardiance is used to treat chronic kidney disease in adult patients.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. If you have type 2 
diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, 
and your body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. This results in high levels of glucose in your 
blood which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor 
circulation in your limbs.
What is heart failure?
Heart failure occurs when the heart is too weak or stiff and cannot work properly. This can lead to 
serious medical problems and need for hospital care. The most common symptoms of heart failure are 
feeling breathless, feeling tired or very tired all the time, and ankle swelling. 
Jardiance helps protect your heart from getting weaker and improves your symptoms.
What is chronic kidney disease?
Chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition. It might be caused by other diseases such as diabetes 
and high blood pressure or even by your own immune system attacking the kidneys. When you have 
chronic kidney disease, your kidneys may gradually lose their ability to clean and filter the blood 
properly. This can lead to serious medical problems such as swollen legs, heart failure or need for 
hospital care. 
Jardiance helps protect your kidneys from losing their function.</p>         </div>"""

section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away:
Ketoacidosis</p>
<p>if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a 
doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of  ketoacidosis<br />
  a serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get because of increased levels of 
 ketone bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing ketoacidosis may 
be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden 
reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine, and during treatment:</p>
<p>if you have  type 1 diabetes . This type usually starts when you are young and your body does 
not produce any insulin. You should not take Jardiance if you have type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>if you have serious kidney problems   your doctor may limit your dose to 10 mg once a day or 
ask you to take a different medicine (see also section 3,  How to take Jardiance ).</p>
<p>if you have serious liver problems   your doctor may ask you to take a different medicine.</p>
<p>might be at risk of dehydration, for example:<em> if you are being sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink</em> if you are taking medicines that increase urine production [diuretics] or lower blood 
pressure* if you are 75 years old or older.
Possible signs are listed in section 4 under  dehydration . Your doctor may ask you to stop 
taking Jardiance until you recover to prevent loss of too much body fluid. Ask about ways to 
prevent dehydration.</p>
<p>if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask 
you to stop taking Jardiance until you have recovered.
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling 
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening 
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue 
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Foot care
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional.
Kidney function
Your kidneys should be checked before you start taking and whilst you are on this medicine.
Urine glucose
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are taking this 
medicine.
Children and adolescents
Jardiance can be used in children aged 10 years and older for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. No data 
are available in children below 10 years of age.
Jardiance is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age for the treatment of 
heart failure or for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, because it has not been studied in these 
patients.
Other medicines and Jardiance
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
It is important to tell your doctor:</p>
<p>if you are taking medicines that increase urine production (diuretics). Your doctor may ask you 
to stop taking Jardiance. Possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are listed in 
section 4.<br />
if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or 
a  sulphonylurea  medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, 
to prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too low (hypoglycaemia).</p>
<p>if you are taking lithium because Jardiance can lower the amount of lithium in your blood.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Jardiance if you are 
pregnant. It is unknown if Jardiance is harmful to the unborn child. Do not use Jardiance if you are 
breast-feeding. It is not known if Jardiance passes into human breast milk.
Driving and using machines
Jardiance has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Taking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause 
blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, 
sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or 
use any tools or machines, if you feel dizzy while taking Jardiance.
Jardiance contains lactose
Jardiance contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Jardiance contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free .</p>         </div>"""

How much to take</p>
<p>The recommended dose of Jardiance is one 10 mg tablet once a day. If you have type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, your doctor will decide whether to increase your dose to 25 mg once a day, if needed 
to help to control your blood sugar.</p>

diabetes medicine. Remember to take all medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best 
results for your health.
Appropriate diet and exercise help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the 
diet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking Jardiance.
If you take more Jardiance than you should
If you take more Jardiance than you should, talk to a doctor immediately or go to a hospital 
immediately. Take the medicine pack with you.

take your next dose at the usual time.</p>
<p>If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at 
the usual time.</p>
