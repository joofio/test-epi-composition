<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given JEMPERLI if you have: </p>
<ul>
<li>immune system problems; </li>
<li>lung or breathing problems; </li>
<li>liver or kidney problems; </li>
<li>serious rash; </li>
<li>any other medical problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms you need to look out for 
JEMPERLI can have serious side effects, which can sometimes become life-threatening and can lead 
to death. These side effects may happen at any time during treatment, or even after your treatment has 
ended. You may get more than one side effect at the same time. </p>
<p>You need to be aware of possible symptoms, so your doctor can give you treatment for side effects if 
necessary. </p>
<p>Read the information under  Symptoms of serious side effects  in section 4. Talk to your doctor or 
nurse if you have any questions or worries. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
JEMPERLI should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and JEMPERLI 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may interfere with the effect of JEMPERLI: 
* medicines that make your immune system weak   for example, corticosteroids, such as 
prednisone. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these. </p>
<p>However, once you are treated with JEMPERLI, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce 
any side effects that you may have. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
<em> You must not be given JEMPERLI if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically 
recommends it.<br />
</em> If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before you are given this medicine.<br />
<em> JEMPERLI can cause harmful effects or death to your unborn baby.<br />
</em> If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception while 
you are being treated with JEMPERLI and for at least 4 months after your last dose.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
<em> If you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
* You must not breast-feed during treatment and for at least 4 months after your last dose of 
JEMPERLI.<br />
</em> It is not known if the active ingredient of JEMPERLI passes into your breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
JEMPERLI is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you have side 
effects that affect your ability to concentrate and react, you should be careful when driving or 
operating machines. </p>
<p>JEMPERLI contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free.  However, before JEMPERLI is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that may 
contain sodium. Talk to your doctor if you are on a low salt diet. </p>         </div>"""
