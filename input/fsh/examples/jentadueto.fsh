metformin.
-
Linagliptin belongs to a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors).
-
Metformin belongs to a class of medicines called biguanides.
How Jentadueto works
The two active substances work together to control blood sugar levels in adult patients with a form of 
diabetes called  type 2 diabetes mellitus . Along with diet and exercise, this medicine helps to improve 
the levels and effects of insulin after a meal and lowers the amount of sugar made by your body.
This medicine can be used alone or with certain other medicines for diabetes like sulphonylureas, 
empagliflozin, or insulin.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that 
your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. 
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems 
like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to linagliptin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine
(listed in section 6).
-
if you have severely reduced kidney function.
if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see  Risk of lactic 
acidosis  below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called  ketone 
bodies  accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell.
-
if you ever had a diabetic pre-coma.
-
if you have a severe infection such as an infection affecting your lung or bronchial system or 
your kidney. Severe infections may lead to kidney problems, which can put you at risk for lactic 
acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions').
-
if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration), e.g. due to long-lasting or severe 
diarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row. Dehydration may lead to kidney 
problems, which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions').
-
if you are treated for acute heart failure or have recently had a heart attack, have severe 
problems with your circulation (such as shock) or have breathing difficulties. This may lead to a 
lack in oxygen supply to tissue which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see 'Warnings and 
precautions').
-
if you have liver problems.
-
if you drink alcohol to excess, either every day or only from time to time (see section 
'Jentadueto with alcohol').
Do not take Jentadueto if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or
pharmacist before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Jentadueto
-
if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin). Jentadueto should not be 
used to treat this condition.
-
if you are taking insulin or an anti-diabetic medicine known as  sulphonylurea , your doctor may 
want to reduce your dose of insulin or sulphonylurea when you take either of them together with 
Jentadueto in order to avoid low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).
-
if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.
If you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, like persistent, severe abdominal pain, you should consult
your doctor.
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. 
Your doctor may ask you to stop Jentadueto.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking Jentadueto.
Diabetic skin problems are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse.
Risk of lactic acidosis.
Due to the metformin component, Jentadueto may cause a very rare, but very serious complication 
called lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing 
lactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or 
alcohol intake, dehydration(see further information below), liver problems and any medical conditions 
in which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Jentadueto for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instruction.
Stop taking Jentadueto and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you 
experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma.
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:
-
vomiting
-
stomach ache (abdominal pain)
-
muscle cramps
-
a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness
-
difficulty in breathing
-
reduced body temperature and heartbeat
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Jentadueto during and for some time after the 
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Jentadueto.
During treatment with Jentadueto, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and Jentadueto
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Jentadueto before or at the time of 
the injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Jentadueto.
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may 
need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the 
dosage of Jentadueto. It is especially important to mention the following:
-
medicines which increase urine production (diuretics)
-
medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen 
and celecoxib)
-
certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists)
-
medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially if you have reduced 
kidney function (such as verapamil, rifampicin, cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, 
trimethoprime, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib, olaparib).
-
carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. These may be used to control fits (seizures) or chronic 
pain.
-
rifampicin. This is an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis.
-
medicines used to treat diseases that involve inflammation, like asthma and arthritis
(corticosteroids).
-
bronchodilators ( -sympathomimetics) for the treatment of bronchial asthma.
-
alcohol-containing medicines.
Jentadueto with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Jentadueto since this may increase the risk of lactic 
acidosis (see section  Warnings and precautions ).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
You should not use Jentadueto if you are pregnant. It is unknown if this medicine is harmful to the 
unborn child.
Metformin passes into human milk in small amounts. It is not known whether linagliptin passes into
human milk. Talk to your doctor if you want to breast-feed while taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Jentadueto has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
However, taking Jentadueto in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can 
cause too low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use 
machines or work without safe foothold.</p>         </div>"""

How much to take
The amount of Jentadueto that you will take varies depending on your condition and the doses you 
currently take of metformin and/or individual tablets of linagliptin and metformin. Your doctor will 
tell you exactly the dose of this medicine to take.
How to take this medicine
-
one tablet twice daily by mouth in the dose prescribed by your doctor.
-
with meals to lower your chance of an upset stomach.
You should not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of 5 mg linagliptin and 2,000 mg 
metformin hydrochloride.
Continue to take Jentadueto as long as your doctor prescribes it so you can continue to help control 
your blood sugar. Your doctor may prescribe this medicine together with another oral anti-diabetic 
medicine or insulin. Remember to take all medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best 
results for your health.
You should continue your diet during treatment with Jentadueto and take care that your carbohydrate
intake is equally distributed over the day. If you are overweight, continue your energy-restricted diet 
as instructed. This medicine alone is unlikely to cause abnormally low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). 
When Jentadueto is used with a sulphonylurea medicine or with insulin, low blood sugar can occur 
and your doctor may reduce the dose of your sulphonylurea or insulin.
If you take more Jentadueto than you should
If you take more Jentadueto tablets than you should have, you may experience lactic acidosis. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific such as feeling or being very sick, vomiting, stomach 
ache with muscle cramps, a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness, and difficulty in 
breathing. Further symptoms are reduced body temperature and heartbeat. If this happens to you, you 
may need immediate hospital treatment, as lactic acidosis can lead to coma. Stop taking this 
medicine immediately and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away (see section 2). 
Take the medicine pack with you.
If you forget to take Jentadueto
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is nearly time for the 
next dose, skip the missed dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Never take 
two doses at the same time (morning or evening).
If you stop taking Jentadueto
Keep taking Jentadueto until your doctor tells you to stop. This is to help keep your blood sugar under 
control. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

Some symptoms need immediate medical attention
You should stop taking Jentadueto and see your doctor straight away if you experience the following 
symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia): trembling, sweating, anxiety, blurred vision, tingling 
lips, paleness, mood change, or confusion. Hypoglycaemia (frequency very common (may affect more 
than 1 in 10 people)) is an identified side effect for the combination of Jentadueto plus sulphonylurea
and for the combination Jentadueto plus insulin.
Jentadueto may cause a very rare (may affect up to 1 user in 10,000), but very serious side effect 
called lactic acidosis (see section  Warnings and precautions ). If this happens you must stop taking 
Jentadueto and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately, as lactic acidosis may lead to 
coma.
Some patients have experienced inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis; frequency rare, may affect 
up to 1 in 1000 people). 
STOP taking Jentadueto and contact a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following serious 
side effects:
-
Severe and persistent pain in the abdomen (stomach area) which might reach through to your 
back, as well as nausea and vomiting, as it could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas 
(pancreatitis).
Other side effects of Jentadueto include:
Some patients have experienced allergic reactions (frequency rare), which may be serious, including 
wheezing and shortness of breath (bronchial hyperreactivity; frequency uncommon (may affect up to 1 
in 100 people)). Some patients experienced rash (frequency uncommon), hives (urticaria; frequency 
rare), and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or 
swallowing (angioedema; frequency rare). If you experience any of the signs of illness mentioned 
above, stop taking Jentadueto and call your doctor right away. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine 
to treat your allergic reaction and a different medicine for your diabetes.
Some patients have had the following side effects while taking Jentadueto:
-
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): diarrhoea, blood enzyme increase (lipase increase), 
feeling sick (nausea)
-
Uncommon: inflamed nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), cough, loss of appetite (decreased 
appetite), being sick (vomiting), blood enzyme increase (amylase increase), itching (pruritus)
-
Rare: blistering of skin (bullous pemphigoid)

Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): a metallic taste (taste disturbance), decreased or low 
vitamin B12 levels in the blood (symptoms may include extreme tiredness (fatigue), a sore and red 
tongue (glossitis), pins and needles (paraesthesia) or pale or yellow skin). Your doctor may 
arrange some tests to find out the cause of your symptoms because some of these may also be 
caused by diabetes or due to other unrelated health problems.
-
Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): hepatitis (a problem with your liver), skin 
reaction as redness of the skin (erythema).
Reporting of side effects
