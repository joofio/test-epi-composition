<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Important warning about the dose of Jylamvo (methotrexate): 
This oral solution contains 2 mg methotrexate in 1 ml solution and the scaling of the dosing 
syringe is in ml and not mg. 
Take Jylamvo only once a week for the treatment of rheumatic or skin diseases (RA, JIA and 
psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis). 
Taking too much of Jylamvo (methotrexate) may be fatal.<br />
Please read section 3 of this leaflet very carefully. 
If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you take this medicine. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jylamvo:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have diabetes mellitus treated with insulin </li>
<li>if you are suffering from inactive, chronic infections (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C, 
shingles [herpes zoster]) as they may flare up </li>
<li>if you have ever had any liver or kidney disease </li>
<li>if you have problems with your lung function </li>
<li>if you are particularly overweight </li>
<li>if you have an abnormal build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) or around the lungs (pleural 
effusions) </li>
<li>if you are dried out (dehydrated) or suffer from conditions that result in dehydration (vomiting, 
diarrhoea, constipation, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth) </li>
</ul>
<p>If you had skin problems after radiotherapy (radiation dermatitis) or sunburn, these reactions can recur 
after methotrexate therapy (recall reaction). </p>
<p>Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphoma) may occur in patients receiving low dose methotrexate and if this 
is the case, therapy must be stopped. </p>
<p>Acute bleeding from the lungs in patients with underlying rheumatologic disease has been reported 
with methotrexate. If you experience symptoms of spitting or coughing up blood you should contact 
your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Diarrhoea can be a possible side effect of Jylamvo and requires an interruption of therapy. If you 
suffer from diarrhoea please speak to your doctor. </p>
<p>Certain brain disorders (encephalopathy/leukoencephalopathy) have been reported in cancer patients 
receiving methotrexate. Such side effects cannot be excluded when methotrexate is used to treat other 
diseases. </p>
<p>If you, your partner or your caregiver notice new onset or worsening of neurological symptoms 
including general muscle weakness, disturbance of vision, changes in thinking, memory and 
orientation leading to confusion and personality changes contact your doctor immediately because 
these may be symptoms of a very rare, serious brain infection called progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). </p>
<p>Psoriasis skin changes can become worse during treatment with methotrexate if you are under UV 
light. 
Methotrexate temporarily affects sperm and egg production. Methotrexate can cause miscarriage and 
severe birth defects. You should avoid having a baby if you are being given methotrexate at the time 
and for at least 6 months after the end of your treatment with methotrexate if you are a woman. If you 
are a man you should avoid fathering a child if you are being given methotrexate at the time and for at 
least 3 months after the end of your treatment. See also section  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
fertility . </p>
<p>Recommended follow-up examinations and precautions </p>
<p>Even if methotrexate is used in low doses, serious side effects can occur. In order to detect them in 
time, your doctor must perform monitoring examinations and laboratory tests. </p>
<p>Prior to the start of therapy: </p>
<p>Before you start treatment, your blood will be checked to see if you have enough blood cells. Your 
blood will also be tested to check your liver function and to find out if you have hepatitis. Furthermore, 
serum albumin (a protein in the blood), hepatitis (liver infection) status and kidney function will be 
checked. The doctor may also decide to run other liver tests, some of these may be images of your 
liver and others may need a small sample of tissue taken from the liver in order to examine it more 
closely. Your doctor may also check to see if you have tuberculosis and they may X-ray your chest or 
perform a lung function test. </p>
<p>During the treatment: </p>
<p>Your doctor may perform the following examinations: </p>
<p>examination of the oral cavity and the pharynx for changes in the mucous membrane such as 
inflammation or ulceration </p>
<p>blood tests/ blood count with number of blood cells and measurement of serum methotrexate 
levels </p>
<p>blood test to monitor liver function </p>
<p>Imaging tests to monitor liver condition </p>
<p>small sample of tissue taken from the liver in order to examine it more closely </p>
<p>blood test to monitor kidney function </p>
<p>respiratory tract monitoring and, if necessary, lung function test </p>
<p>It is very important that you appear for these scheduled examinations. </p>
<p>If the results of any of these tests are conspicuous, your doctor will adjust your treatment accordingly. </p>
<p>Children, adolescents and elderly 
Children, adolescents and the elderly treated with methotrexate should have particularly careful 
medical monitoring in order to detect important side effects quickly. </p>
<p>This medicine is not recommended in children under 3 years of age as there is insufficient experience 
in this age group </p>
<p>Other medicines and Jylamvo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal or natural medicinal 
products. 
Remember to inform your doctor about the treatment with Jylamvo if you are prescribed another 
medicine during treatment. </p>
<p>It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are using the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, such as leflunomide, azathioprine (also 
used to prevent rejection after an organ transplant), sulfasalazine (also used for ulcerative 
colitis)  </li>
<li>ciclosporin (for supressing the immune system) </li>
<li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or salicylates (medicines against pain and/or 
inflammation such as acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac and ibuprofen or pyrazole) </li>
<li>live vaccines </li>
<li>diuretics, that reduce fluid retention  </li>
<li>medicines for lowering blood sugar levels such as metformin </li>
<li>retinoids (for the treatment of psoriasis and other skin diseases) </li>
<li>antiepileptic medicines (prevention of seizures) </li>
<li>barbiturates (sleeping medicines) </li>
<li>sedatives </li>
<li>oral contraceptives </li>
<li>probenecid (for gout) </li>
<li>antibiotics </li>
<li>pyrimethamine (for the prevention and treatment of malaria) </li>
<li>vitamin preparations containing folic acid </li>
<li>proton pump inhibitors (for the treatment of heartburn, ulcers and some other stomach 
complaints) </li>
<li>theophylline (for breathing problems) </li>
<li>mercaptopurine (for the treatment of certain types of leukaemia). </li>
<li>cancer treatments ( such as doxorubicin and procarbazine during high-dose methotrexate 
therapy) </li>
</ul>
<p>Jylamvo with food, drink and alcohol 
This medicine can be taken with or without food. When you have taken your dose, drink some water 
and swallow it to ensure you have taken your full dose and there is no methotrexate left in your mouth. 
You should not drink alcohol during treatment with Jylamvo and should avoid drinking excessive 
amounts of coffee, caffeinated drinks and black leaf tea. Ensure that you drink a lot of fluids during 
treatment with Jylamvo because dehydration (the reduction of body water) can increase the side effects 
of methotrexate.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not use Jylamvo during pregnancy except if your doctor has prescribed it for oncology treatment. 
Methotrexate can cause birth defects, harm the unborn child or cause miscarriage. It is associated with 
malformations of the skull, face, heart and blood vessels, brain, and limbs.  It is therefore very 
important that methotrexate is not given to pregnant women or to women who are planning to become 
pregnant unless used for oncology treatment.  </p>
<p>For non-oncological indications, in women of child-bearing age the possibility of a pregnancy must be 
ruled out, e.g. by pregnancy tests, before treatment is started. </p>
<p>Do not use Jylamvo if you are trying to become pregnant. You must avoid becoming pregnant during 
treatment with methotrexate and for at least 6 months after the end of treatment. Therefore you must 
ensure that you are taking effective contraception for the whole of this period (see also section 
"Warnings and precautions"). </p>
<p>If you become pregnant during treatment or suspect you might be pregnant, speak to your doctor as 
soon as possible. If you do become pregnant during treatment, you should be offered advice regarding 
the risk of harmful effects on the child through treatment. </p>
<p>If you want to become pregnant, you should speak with your doctor, who may refer you for specialist 
advice before the planned start of treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment as methotrexate passes into the breast milk. If your doctor 
considers that continuing treatment with methotrexate is essential, you must stop breast-feeding. 
Male Fertility 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father 
takes methotrexate less than 30 mg (15 ml)/week. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded and 
there is no information regarding higher methotrexate doses.  Methotrexate can have a genotoxic 
effect. This means that the medicine can cause genetic mutations. Methotrexate can affect the 
production of sperm, which is associated with the possibility of birth defects. </p>
<p>You should avoid fathering a child or to donate semen during treatment with methotrexate and for at 
least 3 months after the end of treatment. As treatment with methotrexate at higher doses commonly 
used in cancer treatment can cause infertility and genetic mutations, it may be advisable for male 
patients treated with methotrexate doses higher than 30 mg (15 ml)/week to consider sperm 
preservation before the beginning of treatment (see also section "Warnings and precautions"). </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<pre><code>!          Caution: This medicine can affect your capacity to react and your ability to drive.
</code></pre>
<p>Side effects affecting the central nervous system such as tiredness or dizziness can occur during 
treatment with Jylamvo. In some cases the ability to drive or use machines may be affected. If you feel 
tired or dizzy, you should not drive a vehicle or use machines.   </p>
<p>Jylamvo contains ethyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate 
Ethyl parahydroxybenzoate (E214) and sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) may cause 
allergic reactions (possibly delayed). </p>         </div>"""

how it works. </p>
<p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Taking Jylamvo incorrectly can result in severe side effects and even death. </p>
<p>The duration of the treatment is determined by the treating physician. Treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis, severe psoriasis and severe psoriatic arthritis with Jylamvo 
is a long-term treatment. </p>
<p>Recommended dose 
Your doctor will decide what dose of Jylamvo you should take according to the condition you are 
being treated for, how severe it is and your general health. Keep to the dose exactly and follow your 
doctor s instructions exactly on when to take the medicine. </p>
<p>Dose in rheumatic and skin diseases (RA, JIA and psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis) 
Take Jylamvo only once a week. Decide with your doctor the most suitable day of the week to take 
the medicine. </p>
<p>Dosage in adult rheumatoid arthritis:<br />
The usual initial dose is 7.5 mg (3.75 ml), once a week. </p>
<p>Dosage for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis:<br />
The usual initial dose is 7.5 mg (3.75 ml), once a week.  </p>
<p>The doctor may increase the dose if the used dose is not effective but tolerated well.<br />
Your doctor may adjust the dose to suit you according to your response to treatment and side effects. </p>
<p>Dose in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 
Your doctor will tell you what dose you should take for your condition and when you should take the 
dose. Keep to this dose exactly. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents<br />
The doctor will calculate the dose required from the child s body surface area (m2), and the dose is<br />
expressed as mg/m2. Elderly 
Because of the reduced liver and kidney function and the lower folate reserves in elderly patients, a 
relatively low dosage should be chosen for them. </p>
<p>How to take the medicine<br />
Your pack of Jylamvo contains a bottle of medicine with a cap, a bottle adaptor and a white dosing 
syringe. Always use the syringe provided to take your medicine. </p>
<p>If you are a parent or caregiver giving the medicine, wash your hands before and after giving a dose. 
Wipe up spillages immediately. For protection, you should wear disposable gloves when handling 
Jylamvo. </p>
<p>Women who are pregnant, planning to be or breast-feeding should not handle methotrexate. </p>
<p>If Jylamvo comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, you should wash the affected area with water 
and soap. </p>
<p>Jylamvo is for oral use and provided ready for use.  </p>
<p>Please note that this oral solution contains 2 mg methotrexate in 1 ml solution and that the 
scaling of the dosing syringe is in ml and not mg. </p>
<p>Methotrexate can be taken with or without food. When you have taken your dose, drink some water 
and swallow it to ensure you have taken your full dose and there is no methotrexate left in your mouth. </p>
<p>When you use the medicine follow the instructions below: </p>
<ol>
<li>Put on disposable gloves before handling. </li>
<li>Shake the bottle. </li>
<li>Remove the bottle cap and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle. </li>
<li>Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor. </li>
<li>Turn the bottle upside down. </li>
<li>Pull the syringe plunger back SLOWLY so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the 
syringe until the WIDEST part of the white syringe plunger is lined up to the black syringe 
marking of the dose required.  DO NOT measure to the narrow tip of the plunger.  If there are 
air bubbles in the syringe, repeat until bubbles are eliminated. </li>
<li>Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, 
holding the syringe by the barrel rather than the plunger. </li>
<li>Confirm that the dose in the syringe is correct. </li>
<li>Ensure that the patient is sitting up or standing before giving the medicine. 
Gently place the tip of the syringe into the patient s mouth and direct it to the inside of the 
cheek. </li>
<li>Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of the 
cheek. DO NOT push down the plunger too hard or squirt the medicine to the back of the mouth 
or throat as this may cause choking. The plunger should be pushed back gently to the seated 
position until it clicks into place. </li>
<li>Remove the syringe from the patient s mouth. </li>
<li>Ask the patient to swallow the medicine and then to drink some water, making sure no medicine 
is left in the mouth. </li>
<li>Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place. Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. </li>
<li>Wash the syringe immediately after use with fresh warm,  soapy  water and rinse well. The 
syringe should be held under water and the plunger drawn in and out several times until all 
traces of medicine are removed from inside the syringe including the tip. The plunger and barrel 
should then be separated and both washed thoroughly in the warm soapy water. They should 
then be rinsed thoroughly under COLD water and excess water shaken off before wiping dry 
with a clean paper towel. The plunger and barrel should be stored in a clean dry container with 
the medicine and reassembled before next use. All parts of the syringe should be completely dry 
before using it for the next dose. </li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat the above instructions for each dose, as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you take more Jylamvo than you should 
Follow your doctor's dose recommendations. Never change the dose on your own. </p>
<p>If you suspect that you (or someone else) have (has) taken too much Jylamvo, tell your doctor 
immediately or contact the nearest hospital casualty department. The doctor will decide whether any 
treatment is needed. </p>
<p>An overdose of methotrexate can cause serious reactions. The symptoms of an overdose can include 
bleeding, an unusual feeling of weakness, ulcers in the mouth, feeling sick, vomiting, black or bloody 
stools, coughing up blood or vomiting blood with a coffee grounds appearance and a reduced urine. 
See also section 4  Possible side effects . </p>
<p>Take the medicine pack with you when you visit your doctor or the hospital.

<p>If you forget to take Jylamvo<br />
Never take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose but continue with the prescribed dose. Ask 
your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Jylamvo 
Do not interrupt or stop the treatment with Jylamvo without first discussing this with your doctor. If 
you suspect you have a severe side effect, talk to your doctor immediately. </p>

<p>*has been reported for methotrexate used in patients with underlying rheumatologic disease.  </p>
<p>Methotrexate can reduce the number of white blood cells and therefore weaken your immune defences. 
If you notice any symptoms of an infection such as fever or a marked worsening in your general state of 
health or fever with local signs of an infection such as sore throat/inflammation of the throat or mouth or 
problems passing water, see your doctor immediately. A blood test will be done to check for reduction in 
the white blood cells (agranulocytosis). It is important to tell your doctor about all the medicines you take. </p>
<p>Methotrexate can cause serious (sometimes life-threatening) side effects. Your doctor will therefore do tests 
to check for any changes in your blood (such as a low white blood cell count, a low blood platelet count, 
lymphomas), kidneys or liver. </p>

listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in
