<p>Rheumatoid arthritis 
Jyseleca is used to treat adults with rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease of the joints. It can 
be used if previous therapy did not work well enough, or was not tolerated. Jyseleca can be used on its 
own, or together with another arthritis medicine, methotrexate. </p>
<p>Jyseleca reduces inflammation in your body. It helps to reduce pain, tiredness, stiffness and swelling 
in your joints, and it slows down damage to the bone and cartilage in the joints. These effects can help 
you to perform your normal daily activities, and improve your quality of life. </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis 
Jyseleca is used to treat adults with ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory disease of the bowel. It can be 
used if you did not respond well enough or did not tolerate previous therapy. It helps to reduce the 
signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis and to reduce your need for steroids. </p>         </div>"""

<li>if you have an active serious infection (see section  Warnings and precautions ). </li>
<li>if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these apply to you, do not take Jyseleca and tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jyseleca: 
* if you have an infection, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor if you get symptoms 
such as fever, wounds, feeling more tired than usual or dental problems as these can be signs of 
infection. Jyseleca can reduce your body s ability to fight infections and may make an existing 
infection worse or increase the chance of you getting a new infection. If you have diabetes or 
are aged 65 years or older you may have an increased chance of getting infections. 
* if you have ever had tuberculosis (TB), or have come into contact with somebody with TB. 
You may need tests to check for tuberculosis before and during treatment with Jyseleca. 
* if you have had a herpes zoster infection (shingles) in the past, Jyseleca can allow it to come 
back. Tell your doctor if you get a painful skin rash with blisters during Jyseleca treatment as 
these can be signs of shingles. 
* if you have ever had hepatitis B or C. 
* if you have or have had cancer, smoke or have smoked in the past, because your doctor will 
discuss with you if Jyseleca is appropriate for you. 
* Non-melanoma skin cancer has been observed in patients taking Jyseleca. Your doctor may 
recommend that you have regular skin examinations while taking Jyseleca. If new skin lesions 
appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. 
* if you recently had a vaccine, or are due to have one. Certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) 
are not recommended while using Jyseleca. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you start 
Jyseleca. They may want to make sure that you are up to date with your vaccinations. 
* if you have, or have had, heart problems, because your doctor will discuss with you if 
Jyseleca is appropriate for you.<br />
* if you have previously had blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or 
lungs (pulmonary embolism) or have an increased risk for developing this (for example: if you 
had a recent major surgery, if you use hormonal contraceptives\hormonal replacement therapy, 
if a coagulation defect is identified in you or your close relatives). Your doctor will discuss with 
you if Jyseleca is appropriate for you. Tell your doctor if you get sudden shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, chest pain or pain in upper back, swelling of the leg or arm, leg pain or 
tenderness, or redness or discoloration in the leg or arm as these can be signs of blood clots in 
the veins. </p>
<p>Elderly </p>
<p>Patients aged 65 years and older may be at increased risk of infections, heart attack and some types of 
cancer. Your doctor may decide that Jyseleca is not suitable for you. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been 
studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Jyseleca 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, especially if you use medicines that affect your immune system (such as ciclosporin or 
tacrolimus). 
It is also very important to talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
* medicines to treat heart failure, coronary disease or high blood pressure (such as diltiazem or 
carvedilol) 
* the medicine fenofibrate (used to treat high cholesterol) </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
Jyseleca must not be used in pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or if you 
are planning to have a baby, do not take this medicine. Talk to your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Contraception 
Be careful not to get pregnant while you are taking Jyseleca. You must use reliable contraception 
while you are taking Jyseleca, and for at least 1 week after you take your last dose of Jyseleca. If you 
do become pregnant while you are taking Jyseleca, stop taking the tablets and tell your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed while you are taking Jyseleca. It is not known whether the active substance 
passes into human breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Jyseleca can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy when taking Jyseleca, do not drive and do not use any 
tools or machines. </p>
