lung cells to work better in some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited condition in 
which the lungs and the digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. </p>
<p>Kaftrio taken with ivacaftor is for patients aged 6 years and over who have CF, with at least one 
F508del mutation in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. Kaftrio 
is intended as a long-term treatment. </p>
<p>Kaftrio works on a protein called CFTR. The protein is damaged in some people with CF, if they have 
a mutation in the CFTR gene. </p>
<p>Kaftrio is normally taken with another medicine, ivacaftor. Ivacaftor causes the protein to work 
better, while tezacaftor and elexacaftor increase the amount of protein at the cell surface. </p>
<p>Kaftrio (taken with ivacaftor) helps your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also 
notice that you do not get ill as often, or that it is easier to gain weight. </p>         </div>"""

Talk to your doctor and do not take the tablets, if this applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions 
* Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems, or have had them previously. Your doctor 
may need to adjust your dose. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment with 
Kaftrio, especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past. Liver enzymes in 
the blood can increase in patients receiving Kaftrio. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of liver problems. These are listed in 
section 4. * Depression (including suicidal thoughts and behaviours) has been reported in patients while 
taking Kaftrio, usually starting within the first three months of treatment. Talk to your doctor 
straight away if you (or someone taking this medicine) experience any of the following 
symptoms which may be signs of depression: sad or altered mood, anxiety, feelings of emotional 
discomfort or thoughts of harming or killing yourself. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems, or you have previously had them. </p>

<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor before starting treatment with Kaftrio if you have received an organ 
transplant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are using hormonal contraception   for example, women using the 
contraceptive pill. This may mean you are more likely to get a rash while taking Kaftrio.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your doctor may do eye examinations before and during treatment with Kaftrio. Cloudiness 
of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has occurred in some children and 
adolescents receiving this treatment. </p>
</li>
</ul>

Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 6 years because it is not known if Kaftrio is safe 
and effective in this age group. </p>

medicines. Some medicines can affect how Kaftrio works or may make side effects more likely. In 
particular, tell your doctor if you take any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may change the 
dose of one of the medicines if you take any of these.

<p>Kaftrio with food and drink 
Avoid food or drinks containing grapefruit during treatment as these may increase the side effects of 
Kaftrio by increasing the amount of Kaftrio in your body. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
* Ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.<br />
* Pregnancy: It may be better to avoid using this medicine during pregnancy. Your doctor will 
help you decide what is best for you and your child. 
* Breast-feeding: It is not known if ivacaftor, tezacaftor or elexacaftor passes into breast milk. 
Your doctor will consider the benefit of breast-feeding for your baby and the benefit of 
treatment for you to help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Kaftrio can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle, or use machines unless you are not 
affected. </p>
