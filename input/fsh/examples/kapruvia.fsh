kidney disease who need dialysis to clean their blood. </p>
<p>Kapruvia works at targets in the body called kappa-opioid receptors which are involved in controlling 
the perception of itching. By stimulating these receptors on nerves and immune cells outside the brain, 
Kapruvia relieves the sensation of itch caused by chronic kidney disease. The active substance 
difelikefalin does not pass the blood-brain barrier (the natural protective barrier between blood vessels 
and the brain), which reduces the risk of side effects. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Kapruvia if you: 
* have an increased potassium level in the blood 
* have or have had heart weakness or a heart rhythm disorder 
* have reduced function of the blood-brain barrier (such as cancer in the brain or the central 
nervous system, or a disease of the central nervous system like multiple sclerosis or dementia) 
as this might increase your risk of side effects 
* are 65 years of age or older, as you may be more likely to be made drowsy by the medicine 
* are using medicines that could increase the risk of drowsiness or dizziness, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines that slow down brain activity such as those that help with sleep disturbances 
and anxiety </li>
<li>medicines to treat allergies, cold, nausea and/or vomiting called sedating antihistamines  </li>
<li>strong painkillers, called opioid analgesics 
Talk to your doctor if you take any of these medicines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Kapruvia is not recommended for children under 18 years, as it has not been studied in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kapruvia 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given Kapruvia. </p>
<p>Kapruvia has not been studied in pregnant women. It is unknown whether Kapruvia can harm the 
unborn baby. Your doctor will discuss with you if you should use Kapruvia during pregnancy.  </p>
<p>It is not known whether difelikefalin can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding your doctor 
will advise you on whether to stop breast-feeding or using Kapruvia, considering the benefit of breast-
feeding to the baby and Kapruvia to you, the mother.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Kapruvia can cause drowsiness and dizziness which may affect your ability to react. Do not drive or 
use machines if your ability to react is reduced or you do not know the effect of Kapruvia on your 
ability to react. </p>
<p>Kapruvia contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .  </p>         </div>"""

given as an injection into a vein by a doctor or nurse at the end of your dialysis treatment through the 
tube that connects you to the dialysis machine. </p>
<p>Kapruvia will be given 3 times per week. This increases to 4 times per week in case of a fourth 
dialysis. No more than 4 doses are recommended, even if the number of dialysis treatments in a week 
is more than 4. If a dialysis treatment is unfinished, your doctor will decide whether it is better for you to receive 
Kapruvia after the unfinished dialysis session or wait until your next dialysis treatment. 
If a dialysis treatment is missed, the usual dose of Kapruvia will be given to you at the next dialysis 
treatment. 
Itching is expected to decrease after 2-3 weeks treatment with Kapruvia. </p>
<p>Patients with reduced liver function 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate reduced liver function. Kapruvia is 
not recommended for patients with severely reduced liver function, as use has not been studied in 
these patients. </p>
<p>If you have been given more Kapruvia than you should
