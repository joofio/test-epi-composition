<p>Platelets are very small cells in the blood that can clump together and help the blood to clot. 
Sometimes clots can form within a damaged blood vessel such as in an artery in the heart and this can 
be very dangerous as the clot can cut off the blood supply (a thrombotic event), causing a heart attack 
(myocardial infarction). </p>
<p>Kengrexal diminishes the clumping of platelets and so reduces the chance of a blood clot forming. </p>
<p>You have been prescribed Kengrexal because you have blocked blood vessels in your heart (coronary 
artery disease) and you need a procedure (called a percutaneous coronary intervention   PCI) to 
remove the blockage. During this procedure you may have a stent inserted in your blood vessel to help 
to keep it open. Using Kengrexal reduces the risk that this procedure will cause a clot to form and 
block the blood vessels again. </p>
<p>Kengrexal is only for use in adults. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to cangrelor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as bleeding from the 
stomach or intestines or you have a condition which makes you more prone to uncontrolled 
bleeding (impaired haemostasis or irreversible coagulation disorders). 
- If you have recently undergone major surgery or suffered from any form of serious physical 
trauma such as a bone fracture or road traffic accident. 
- If you have uncontrolled very high blood pressure. 
- If you have ever had a stroke, or a  mini-stroke  (also known as a transient ischaemic attack, 
TIA) caused by the temporary interruption of the blood supply to the brain. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Kengrexal if: 
* You are, or you think you may be at increased risk of bleeding. For example, if you have a 
medical condition that affects blood clotting or because of another medical condition that may 
increase the risk of bleeding such as a recent serious injury, any recent surgery, history of a 
stroke or a transient ischaemic attack  or recent bleeding from your stomach or gut. 
* You suffer from impaired kidney function or require dialysis. 
* You have ever suffered from an allergic reaction to Kengrexal or any of its constituents. 
* You suffer from breathing difficulties such as asthma. 
* You have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Kengrexal is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kengrexal 
You may receive acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) while you are treated with Kengrexal or another type of 
anti-platelet medicine (e.g., clopidogrel) before and after you are treated with Kengrexal. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines that may increase the risk of side effects such as 
bleeding including blood thinners (anticoagulants e.g. warfarin). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. Kengrexal is not recommended for use during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
The effect of Kengrexal wears off quickly and it is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use 
machines. </p>
<p>Kengrexal contains sodium and sorbitol 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic 
disorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which 
may cause serious side effects. 
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
