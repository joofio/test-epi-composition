* on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to 
treat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits 
(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only 
one side of the brain but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain 
(partial onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given 
to you by your doctor to reduce the number of fits.

<p>partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents, children and 
infants from one month of age; </p>
<p>myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in adults and

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Keppra 
* If you suffer from kidney problems, follow your doctor s instructions. He/she may decide if 
your dose should be adjusted. 
* If you notice any slowdown in the growth or unexpected puberty development of your child, 
please contact your doctor. 
* A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Keppra have had thoughts 
of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal 
ideation, please contact your doctor. 
* If you have a family or medical history of irregular heart rhythm (visible on an 
electrocardiogram), or if you have a disease and/or take a treatment that make(s) you prone to 
heartbeat irregularities or salt imbalances. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the following side effects gets serious or last longer than a few 
days: 
* Abnormal thoughts, feeling irritable or reacting more aggressively than usually, or if you or 
your family and friends notice important changes in mood or behaviour. 
* Aggravation of epilepsy: 
Your seizures may rarely become worse or happen more often, mainly during the first month 
after the start of the treatment or increase of the dose.<br />
In a very rare form of early-onset epilepsy (epilepsy associated with SCN8A mutations) that 
causes multiple types of seizures and loss of skills you may notice that the seizures remain 
present or are becoming worse during your treatment.  </p>
<p>If you experience any of these new symptoms while taking Keppra, see a doctor as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<ul>
<li>Keppra is not indicated in children and adolescents below 16 years on its own (monotherapy).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Keppra 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not take macrogol (a drug used as laxative) for one hour before and one hour after taking 
levetiracetam as this may results in a loss of its effect.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only 
if after careful assessment it is considered necessary by your doctor. 
You should not stop your treatment without discussing this with your doctor. 
A risk of birth defects for your unborn child cannot be completely excluded.<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Keppra may impair your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery, as it may make you feel 
sleepy. This is more likely at the beginning of treatment or after an increase in the dose. You should 
not drive or use machines until it is established that your ability to perform such activities is not 
affected. </p>

250 mg in the morning and 1 tablet of 250 mg in the evening, and the dose will be gradually 
incremented to reach 1000 mg daily after 2 weeks. </p>

alertness, inhibition of breathing and coma. 
Contact your doctor if you took more tablets than you should. Your doctor will establish the best 
possible treatment of overdose. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Keppra: 
Contact your doctor if you have missed one or more doses.<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.  </p>
<p>If you stop taking Keppra: 
If stopping treatment, Keppra should be discontinued gradually to avoid an increase of seizures. 
Should your doctor decide to stop your Keppra treatment, he/she will instruct you about the gradual 
withdrawal of Keppra. </p>
