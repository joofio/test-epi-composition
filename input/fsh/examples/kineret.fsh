agent) that is used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) </li>
<li>COVID-19 in patients who have pneumonia, need extra oxygen and are at risk of lung failure </li>
<li>
<p>Periodic fever syndromes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) * 
Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), also called Chronic 
Infantile Neurological, Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA), * 
Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), * 
Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) </p>
</li>
<li>Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) </li>
<li>Still s disease including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still s 
Disease (AOSD) </li>
</ul>
<p>Cytokines are proteins made by your body that co-ordinate communication between cells and help 
control cell activity. In RA, CAPS, FMF, Still s disease, and in COVID-19 pneumonia, your body 
produces too much of a cytokine called interleukin-1. This results in harmful effects leading to 
inflammation, causing the symptoms of the disease. Normally, your body produces a protein that 
blocks the harmful effects of interleukin-1. The active substance of Kineret is anakinra, this works in 
the same way as your natural interleukin-1 blocking protein. Anakinra is produced by DNA 
technology using the micro-organism E. coli. </p>
<p>For RA, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of the disease in adults (age 18 years and 
over) in combination with another medicine called methotrexate. Kineret is for patients whose 
response to methotrexate on its own is not good enough to control the rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>For COVID-19, Kineret is used to treat the hyperinflammation (stronger than the usual inflammation) 
associated with the disease in adults (age 18 years and over) who have pneumonia, need extra oxygen 
to help them breathe (low- or high-flow oxygen) and are at risk of lung failure. </p>
<p>For CAPS, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the 
disease such as rash, joint pain, fever, headache and fatigue in adults and children (age 8 months and 
older). </p>
<p>For FMF, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the disease 
such as recurrent fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, muscle or joint pain and rash. Kineret can be used 
together with colchicine, if appropriate. </p>
<p>For Still s disease, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the 
disease such as rash, joint pain and fever. </p> </div>"""

- if you have neutropenia (low white blood cell count) determined after a blood test. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately 
- if you get a rash all over your body, shortness of breath, wheezing, fast pulse or sweating after 
your Kineret injection. These may be signs that you are allergic to Kineret. 
- if you have ever developed an atypical, widespread rash or skin peeling after taking Kineret. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Kineret:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a history of recurring infections, or if you suffer from asthma. Kineret may worsen 
these conditions; </li>
<li>if you have cancer. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given Kineret; </li>
<li>if you have a history of increased levels of liver enzymes; </li>
<li>if you require vaccinations. You must not be given live vaccines while being treated with 
Kineret. </li>
</ul>
<p>Still s disease 
- In rare cases patients with Still s disease, mainly children, may develop lung disease, also 
during Kineret treatment. The risk may be increased in patients with Down s syndrome (trisomy 
21). Symptoms of lung disease can be e.g. shortness of breath during light exercise, morning 
cough, and difficulties breathing. If you develop signs of lung disease you should contact your 
health care provider as soon as possible.<br />
- The serious skin reaction, DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), 
has rarely been reported in association with Kineret treatment, predominantly in patients with 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). Seek medical attention immediately if you notice 
an atypical, widespread rash, which may occur in conjunction with high body temperature and 
enlarged lymph nodes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
- RA: Use of Kineret in children and adolescents with Rheumatoid Arthritis has not been fully 
investigated and therefore cannot be recommended. 
- COVID-19: Use of Kineret in children and adolescents with COVID-19 has not been 
investigated and therefore cannot be recommended. 
- CAPS, FMF, Still s disease: Kineret is not recommended for children younger than 8 months of 
age because there is no data in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kineret 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Medicines called tumour necrosis factor (TNF- ) inhibitors, such as etanercept should not be used 
with Kineret because this may increase the risk of infections. </p>
<p>When you start taking Kineret the chronic inflammation in your body will decrease. This could mean 
that the doses of some other medicines, e.g. warfarin or phenytoin, have to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Kineret has not been tested in pregnant women. Use of Kineret is not recommended during pregnancy 
and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. It is important to tell your doctor if 
you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor will 
discuss with you the potential risks of taking Kineret during pregnancy. </p>
<p>It is not known whether anakinra is excreted in human milk. You must not breast-feed if you use 
Kineret. </p>
<p>Kineret contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say essentially

og hjælper med at kontrollere celleaktiviteten. Ved RA, CAPS, FMF, Stills sygdom og ved 
COVID-19-lungebetændelse producerer kroppen for meget af det cytokin, som hedder interleukin-1. Dette har skadelige virkninger, der fører til betændelsestilstande (inflammation), der forårsager 
sygdommens symptomer. Normalt producerer kroppen et protein, som blokerer for interleukin-1's 
skadelige virkning. Det aktive stof i Kineret er anakinra, der virker på samme måde som det naturlige

Fortæl altid lægen, hvis De tager anden medicin, for nylig har taget anden medicin eller planlægger at 
tage anden medicin. </p>
<p>Visse lægemidler, som kaldes TNF-α-hæmmere (tumornekrosefaktorhæmmere), som f.eks. etanercept, 
må ikke anvendes sammen med Kineret, fordi dette kan øge risikoen for infektioner. </p>
<p>Når De begynder at tage Kineret, reduceres den kroniske inflammation. Dette kan medføre, at 
doseringen af visse andre lægemidler som f.eks. warfarin skal justeres. </p>
<p>Graviditet og amning 
Hvis De er gravid eller ammer, har mistanke om, at De er gravid, eller planlægger at blive gravid, skal 
De spørge Deres læge til råds, før De tager dette lægemiddel. </p>
<p>Kineret er ikke blevet afprøvet hos gravide kvinder. Kineret bør ikke anvendes under graviditet, og til 
kvinder i den fertile alder, som ikke anvender sikker prævention. Det er vigtigt at fortælle det til 
lægen, hvis De er gravid, har mistanke om, at De er gravid eller planlægger at blive gravid. Lægen vil 
diskutere de mulige risici ved at tage Kineret under graviditeten med Dem. </p>
<p>Det er ukendt, om anakinra udskilles i human mælk. De skal derfor ikke amme, hvis De bruger 
Kineret. </p>
<p>Kineret indeholder natrium 
Dette lægemiddel indeholder mindre end 1 mmol (23 mg) natrium pr. 100 mg dosis, dvs. det er i det 
væsentlige natriumfrit. </p> </div>"""

<p>VEJLEDNING I KLARGØRING OG INJEKTION AF KINERET </p>
<p>Dette afsnit indeholder information om, hvorledes De injicerer Kineret til Dem selv eller Deres barn. 
Det er vigtigt, at De ikke forsøger at give Dem selv eller Deres barn injektionen, før Deres læge, 
sygeplejerske eller apotekspersonalet har vist Dem hvorledes. Hvis De er i tvivl om, hvorledes De 
injicerer Dem selv, så spørg Deres læge, sygeplejerske eller apotekspersonalet om hjælp. </p>
<p>Sådan skal De eller den person, der giver Dem injektionen, anvende den fyldte injektionssprøjte 
med Kineret </p>
<p>Det er vigtigt, at De injicerer Dem selv eller Deres barn på samme tidspunkt hver dag. Kineret 
injiceres lige under huden. Dette kaldes en subkutan injektion. </p>
<p>Udstyr: </p>
<p>For at give Dem selv eller Deres barn en subkutan injektion skal De bruge: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>en fyldt injektionssprøjte med Kineret </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>desinficerende servietter eller lignende, og </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>steril gaze eller serviet </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sådan skal De gøre, før De injicerer Dem selv eller Deres barn subkutant med Kineret </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tage den fyldte injektionssprøjte med Kineret ud af køleskabet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Den fyldte injektionssprøjte må ikke omrystes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kontroller udløbsdatoen på den fyldte injektionssprøjtes etiket (EXP). Anvend ikke den fyldte 
injektionssprøjte, hvis den sidste dato i den angivne måned er passeret. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kontroller Kinerets udseende. Opløsningen skal være klar, farveløs til hvid. Den kan evt. 
indeholde delvist gennemsigtige eller hvidlige proteinpartikler. Disse partikler har ingen 
betydning for produktets kvalitet. Hvis opløsningen er misfarvet eller grumset, eller hvis den 
indeholder andre partikler end de delvist gennemsigtige eller hvidlige, må den ikke anvendes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For at gøre indsprøjtningen mere behagelig kan De lade den fyldte injektionssprøjte ligge ved 
stuetemperatur i ca. 30 minutter, eller De kan holde den fyldte injektionssprøjte forsigtigt i 
hånden et par minutter. Opvarm ikke Kineret på nogen anden måde (De må ikke opvarme i 
mikrobølgeovn eller i varmt vand). </p>

utilizado no tratamento de: 
- Artrite reumatoide (AR) 
- COVID-19 em doentes com pneumonia, que necessitam de oxigénio adicional e que estão em 
risco de insuficiência pulmonar 
- Síndromes febris periódicas 
- Síndromes Periódicas Associadas à Criopirina (CAPS) 
o 
Doença Inflamatória Multissistémica de Início Neonatal (NOMID), também 
chamada Síndrome Crónica Infantil Neurológica, Cutânea e Articular (CINCA), 
o 
Síndrome de Muckle-Wells (MWS), 
o 
Síndrome Autoinflamatória Familiar induzida pelo Frio (FCAS) 
- Febre mediterrânica familiar (FMF) 
- Doença de Still incluindo Artrite idiopática juvenil sistémica (SJIA) e a Doença de Still do 
adulto (AOSD) </p>
<p>As citocinas são proteínas produzidas pelo corpo que coordenam a comunicação entre as células e 
ajudam a controlar a atividade celular. Quando se sofre de AR, CAPS, FMF, doença de Still e 
pneumonia por COVID-19, o corpo produz uma elevada quantidade de uma citocina chamada 
interleucina-1. Isto resulta em efeitos nocivos, que levam a inflamação, causando os sintomas da 
doença. Normalmente, o corpo produz uma proteína que bloqueia os efeitos nocivos da interleucina-1. A substância ativa do Kineret é o anacinra, que funciona do mesmo modo que a sua proteína natural 
bloqueadora da interleucina-1. Anacinra é produzido por tecnologia de ADN, utilizando o 
microrganismo E. coli. </p>
<p>Na AR, Kineret é utilizado para tratar os sinais e sintomas da doença em adultos (com 18 anos de 
idade ou mais) em combinação com outro medicamento chamado metotrexato. Kineret destina-se aos 
doentes cuja resposta ao metotrexato, por si só, não é suficientemente boa para controlar a artrite 
reumatoide. </p>
<p>Na COVID-19, Kineret é utilizado para tratar a hiperinflamação (mais forte do que a inflamação 
habitual) associada à doença em adultos (com 18 anos de idade ou mais) com pneumonia, que 
necessitam de oxigénio adicional para os ajudar a respirar (baixo e alto fluxo) e que estão em risco de 
insuficiência pulmonar. </p>
<p>Nas CAPS, Kineret é utilizado para tratar os sinais e sintomas de inflamação associada à doença, tais 
como erupção cutânea, dor nas articulações, dor de cabeça e fadiga, em adultos e crianças (com 
8 meses de idade ou mais). </p>
<p>Na FMF, Kineret é utilizado para tratar os sinais e sintomas da inflamação associada à doença, como 
febre recorrente, fadiga, dor abdominal, dor nos músculos ou nas articulações e erupção na pele.

<p>Contacte o seu médico imediatamente 
- se após a administração do Kineret desenvolver erupção da pele generalizada, dispneia, síbilo, 
pulsação acelerada ou sudorese. Estes podem ser sinais de que é alérgico ao Kineret. 
- se alguma vez desenvolveu uma erupção cutânea generalizada e atípica ou descamação da pele 
após tomar Kineret. </p>
<p>Advertências e precauções 
Fale com o seu médico antes de utilizar Kineret: 
- se tem um historial médico de infeções recorrentes ou se sofre de asma. O Kineret pode piorar 
estas situações; 
- se tem cancro. O seu médico terá de decidir se mesmo assim pode receber Kineret; 
- se tiver um histórico de aumento dos níveis de enzimas hepáticas; 
- se requer vacinações. Não lhe podem ser administradas vacinas vivas enquanto estiver a ser 
tratado com Kineret. </p>
<p>Doença de Still 
- Em casos raros, doentes com doença de Still, sobretudo crianças, podem desenvolver doença 
pulmonar, mesmo durante o tratamento com Kineret. O risco pode ser acrescido em doentes 
com síndrome de Down (trissomia 21). Sintomas de doença pulmonar podem ser, p. ex., falta de 
ar durante exercício ligeiro, tosse matinal e dificuldade em respirar. Se desenvolver sinais de 
doença pulmonar, deve contactar o seu prestador de cuidados de saúde o mais cedo possível. 
- A reação cutânea grave, DRESS (reação medicamentosa com eosinofilia e sintomas sistémicos), 
foi notificada raramente em associação com o tratamento com Kineret, predominantemente em 
doentes com artrite idiopática juvenil sistémica (SJIA). Consulte imediatamente um médico se 
notar uma erupção cutânea generalizada e atípica, que pode ocorrer em conjunto com 
temperatura corporal elevada e aumento dos gânglios linfáticos. </p>
<p>Crianças e adolescentes 
- AR: A utilização de Kineret em crianças e adolescentes com Artrite Reumatoide não foi 
totalmente investigada e como tal não pode ser recomendada. 
- COVID-19: A utilização de Kineret em crianças e adolescentes com COVID-19 não foi 
totalmente investigada e como tal não pode ser recomendada. 
- CAPS, FMF e doença de Still: Kineret não é recomendado em crianças com menos de 8 meses 
de idade pois não existem dados neste grupo etário. </p>
<p>Outros medicamentos e Kineret 
Informe o seu médico ou farmacêutico se estiver a tomar, tiver tomado recentemente, ou se vier a 
tomar outros medicamentos. </p>
<p>Os medicamentos denominados inibidores do fator de necrose tumoral (TNF-α), tais como o 
etanercept, não devem ser utilizados com Kineret, pois isso pode aumentar o risco de infeções. </p>
<p>Quando começar a tomar Kineret, a inflamação crónica no seu corpo irá diminuir. Isto poderá 
significar que as doses de alguns outros medicamentos, por exemplo, varfarina ou fenitoína, têm de ser 
ajustadas. </p>
<p>Gravidez e amamentação 
Se está grávida ou a amamentar, se pensa estar grávida ou planeia engravidar, consulte o seu médico 
antes de tomar este medicamento. </p>
<p>Kineret não foi testado em mulheres grávidas. A utilização de Kineret não é recomendada durante a 
gravidez e em mulheres com potencial para engravidar que não utilizam métodos contracetivos. É 
importante que contacte o seu médico se está grávida, se pensa estar grávida ou planeia engravidar. O 
seu médico discutirá consigo os riscos potenciais de tomar Kineret durante a gravidez. </p>
<p>Desconhece-se se o anacinra é excretado no leite humano. Não deve amamentar se estiver a utilizar 
Kineret. </p>
<p>Kineret contém sódio 
Este medicamento contém menos do que 1 mmol (23 mg) de sódio por dose de 100 mg, ou seja, é

<p>Os possíveis efeitos indesejáveis são semelhantes, quer esteja a ser tratado com Kineret para a AR, 
CAPS, FMF, doença de Still ou COVID-19.<br />
Se ocorrer qualquer um dos seguintes sintomas, informe imediatamente o seu médico: 
- Infeções graves como pneumonia (infeção pulmonar) ou infeções da pele podem ocorrer 
durante o tratamento com Kineret. Os sintomas podem incluir febre alta persistente, calafrios, 
tosse, dores de cabeça e vermelhidão e sensibilidade da pele. Uma febre baixa persistente, perda 
de peso e tosse persistente também podem ser sinais de uma infeção. 
- Reações alérgicas graves são pouco frequentes. No entanto, qualquer um dos seguintes 
sintomas pode indicar uma reação alérgica ao Kineret, pelo que deve informar imediatamente o 
médico. Não injete mais Kineret. 
- Tumefação (inchaço) da face, língua e garganta 
- Dificuldades em engolir ou respirar 
- Sensação súbita de pulsação acelerada ou sudorese 
- Pele pruriginosa (com comichão) e erupção da pele </p>
<p>Efeitos indesejáveis muito frequentes (podem afetar mais de 1 em 10 pessoas): 
- Vermelhidão, tumefação (inchaço), nódoas negras ou prurido no local da injeção. Estes 
sintomas são geralmente ligeiros a moderados e são mais frequentes no início do seu 
tratamento. 
- Dores de cabeça. 
- Níveis aumentados de colesterol total no sangue. </p>
<p>Efeitos indesejáveis frequentes (podem afetar até 1 em 10 pessoas): 
- Neutropenia (número baixo de glóbulos brancos) determinada após um teste sanguíneo. Este 
facto pode aumentar o risco de apanhar uma infeção. Os sintomas de uma infeção podem incluir 
febre ou faringite. 
- Infeções graves como pneumonia (infeção pulmonar) ou infeções da pele. 
- Trombocitopenia (nível baixo de plaquetas sanguíneas). </p>
<p>Efeitos indesejáveis pouco frequentes (podem afetar até 1 em 100 pessoas): 
- Reações alérgicas graves, incluindo tumefação (inchaço) da face, língua e garganta, dificuldades 
em engolir ou respirar, sensação súbita de pulsação acelerada ou sudorese, ou pele pruriginosa 
(com comichão) e erupção da pele. 
- Níveis elevados de enzimas hepáticas determinados após uma análise ao sangue. </p>
<p>Efeitos indesejáveis com frequência desconhecida (a frequência não pode ser calculada a partir dos 
dados disponíveis):<br />
- Sinais de problemas hepáticos, tais como pele e olhos amarelos, náuseas, perda de apetite, urina 
de cor escura e fezes de cor clara. 
- Se Kineret for injetado repetidamente no mesmo local, existe o risco de formação de um nódulo 
(depósito amiloide) sob a pele. Para evitá-lo, deve fazer-se a rotação do local de injeção. </p>
