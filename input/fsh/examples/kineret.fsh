  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Kineret contains the active substance anakinra. This is a type of cytokine (an immunosuppressive 
agent) that is used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) </li>
<li>COVID-19 in patients who have pneumonia, need extra oxygen and are at risk of lung failure </li>
<li>
<p>Periodic fever syndromes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) * 
Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), also called Chronic 
Infantile Neurological, Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA), * 
Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), * 
Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) </p>
</li>
<li>Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) </li>
<li>Still s disease including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still s 
Disease (AOSD) </li>
</ul>
<p>Cytokines are proteins made by your body that co-ordinate communication between cells and help 
control cell activity. In RA, CAPS, FMF, Still s disease, and in COVID-19 pneumonia, your body 
produces too much of a cytokine called interleukin-1. This results in harmful effects leading to 
inflammation, causing the symptoms of the disease. Normally, your body produces a protein that 
blocks the harmful effects of interleukin-1. The active substance of Kineret is anakinra, this works in 
the same way as your natural interleukin-1 blocking protein. Anakinra is produced by DNA 
technology using the micro-organism E. coli. </p>
<p>For RA, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of the disease in adults (age 18 years and 
over) in combination with another medicine called methotrexate. Kineret is for patients whose 
response to methotrexate on its own is not good enough to control the rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>For COVID-19, Kineret is used to treat the hyperinflammation (stronger than the usual inflammation) 
associated with the disease in adults (age 18 years and over) who have pneumonia, need extra oxygen 
to help them breathe (low- or high-flow oxygen) and are at risk of lung failure. </p>
<p>For CAPS, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the 
disease such as rash, joint pain, fever, headache and fatigue in adults and children (age 8 months and 
older). </p>
<p>For FMF, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the disease 
such as recurrent fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, muscle or joint pain and rash. Kineret can be used 
together with colchicine, if appropriate. </p>
<p>For Still s disease, Kineret is used to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation associated with the 
disease such as rash, joint pain and fever. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to anakinra or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, listed in section 6; 
- if you are allergic to other products that are produced by DNA technology using the micro-
organism E. coli; 
- if you have neutropenia (low white blood cell count) determined after a blood test. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately 
- if you get a rash all over your body, shortness of breath, wheezing, fast pulse or sweating after 
your Kineret injection. These may be signs that you are allergic to Kineret. 
- if you have ever developed an atypical, widespread rash or skin peeling after taking Kineret. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Kineret:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a history of recurring infections, or if you suffer from asthma. Kineret may worsen 
these conditions; </li>
<li>if you have cancer. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given Kineret; </li>
<li>if you have a history of increased levels of liver enzymes; </li>
<li>if you require vaccinations. You must not be given live vaccines while being treated with 
Kineret. </li>
</ul>
<p>Still s disease 
- In rare cases patients with Still s disease, mainly children, may develop lung disease, also 
during Kineret treatment. The risk may be increased in patients with Down s syndrome (trisomy 
21). Symptoms of lung disease can be e.g. shortness of breath during light exercise, morning 
cough, and difficulties breathing. If you develop signs of lung disease you should contact your 
health care provider as soon as possible.<br />
- The serious skin reaction, DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), 
has rarely been reported in association with Kineret treatment, predominantly in patients with 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). Seek medical attention immediately if you notice 
an atypical, widespread rash, which may occur in conjunction with high body temperature and 
enlarged lymph nodes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
- RA: Use of Kineret in children and adolescents with Rheumatoid Arthritis has not been fully 
investigated and therefore cannot be recommended. 
- COVID-19: Use of Kineret in children and adolescents with COVID-19 has not been 
investigated and therefore cannot be recommended. 
- CAPS, FMF, Still s disease: Kineret is not recommended for children younger than 8 months of 
age because there is no data in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kineret 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Medicines called tumour necrosis factor (TNF- ) inhibitors, such as etanercept should not be used 
with Kineret because this may increase the risk of infections. </p>
<p>When you start taking Kineret the chronic inflammation in your body will decrease. This could mean 
that the doses of some other medicines, e.g. warfarin or phenytoin, have to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Kineret has not been tested in pregnant women. Use of Kineret is not recommended during pregnancy 
and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. It is important to tell your doctor if 
you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor will 
discuss with you the potential risks of taking Kineret during pregnancy. </p>
<p>It is not known whether anakinra is excreted in human milk. You must not breast-feed if you use 
Kineret. </p>
<p>Kineret contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>For instructions on how to inject yourself or your child with Kineret, please read the  Instructions for 
preparing and giving an injection of Kineret  section at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>If you use more Kineret than you should 
You should have no serious problems if you accidentally take more Kineret than you need. However, 
you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. If you feel unwell in any way 
you should contact your doctor or nurse immediately. </p>
