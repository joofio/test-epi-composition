<p>Kirsty is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and 
above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce 
enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with Kirsty helps to prevent 
complications from your diabetes.  </p>
<p>Kirsty will start to lower your blood sugar 10-20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect occurs 
between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3-5 hours. Due to this short action 
Kirsty should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin 
preparations. Moreover Kirsty can be used for continuous infusion in a pump system. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless.<br />
If any of these applies, do not use Kirsty. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. </p>
<p>Before using Kirsty </p>
<p>Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin.  </p>
<p>Remove the protective cap.  </p>
<p>Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination.  </p>
<p>Needles and syringes must not be shared. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: </p>
<p>If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  </p>
<p>If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  </p>
<p>If you are ill, carry on using your insulin and consult your doctor.  </p>
<p>If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use Kirsty). Tell your doctor if 
you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried 
out in children below the age of 1 year. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kirsty 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you use:<br />
<em> Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes<br />
</em> Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)<br />
<em> Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure)<br />
</em> Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure)<br />
<em> Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)<br />
</em> Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)<br />
* Sulphonamides (used to treat infections).  </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you use:<br />
<em> Oral contraceptives (birth control pills)<br />
</em> Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention)<br />
<em> Glucocorticoids (such as  cortisone  used to treat inflammation)<br />
</em> Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders)<br />
<em> Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat 
asthma)<br />
</em> Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body s metabolic processes)<br />
* Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  </p>
<p>Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar.  </p>
<p>Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  </p>
<p>If you have used any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Kirsty and alcohol </p>
<p>If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before using this medicine. Kirsty can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose 
may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, 
particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  </p>
<p>There are no restrictions on treatment with Kirsty during breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine:<br />
<em> If you have frequent hypoglycaemia.<br />
</em> If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia.  </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and 
therefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger 
yourself or others.  </p>
<p>Kirsty has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier after 
an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. </p>
<p>Kirsty contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Dose and when to use your insulin<br />
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Kirsty is generally used immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of the 
injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, Kirsty can be given soon after a meal. See How 
and where to inject below for information.<br />
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Kirsty can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human insulin 
when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in relation 
to meals.  </p>
<p>Use in special patient groups<br />
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor.  </p>
<p>How and where to inject<br />
Kirsty is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). or for continuous infusion in a pump system. 
Administration in a pump system will require a comprehensive instruction by your healthcare 
professional. You must never inject yourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle 
(intramuscularly). If necessary Kirsty can be given directly into a vein but this must only be done by 
physicians or other healthcare staff.  </p>
<p>With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front of 
your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if injected into the front of your waist. You should 
always measure your blood sugar regularly.  </p>
<p>How to use Kirsty 
1. Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. 
Inject the air into the vial.<br />
2. Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull 
the needle out of the vial. Then expel the air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct. </p>
<p>How to inject Kirsty </p>
<p>Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse.  </p>
<p>Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the 
insulin.  </p>
<p>Discard the needle after each injection. </p>
<p>For use in an infusion pump system<br />
Kirsty should never be mixed with any other insulin when used in a pump.<br />
Follow the instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding the use of Kirsty in a pump. 
Before use of Kirsty in the pump system, you must have received a comprehensive instruction in the 
use and information about any actions to be taken in case of illness, too high or too low blood sugar or 
failure of the pump system.<br />
<em> Before inserting the needle, use soap and water to clean your hands and the skin where the 
needle is inserted to avoid any infection at the infusion site.<br />
</em> When you fill a new reservoir, be certain not to leave large air bubbles in either the syringe or 
the tubing.<br />
* Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set.<br />
To get the benefit of insulin infusion, and to detect possible malfunction of the insulin pump, it is 
recommended that you measure your blood sugar level regularly. </p>
<p>What to do in case of pump system failure<br />
You should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under 
the skin in case of pump system failure. 
If you use more insulin than you should 
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of 
serious and very common side effects in section 4. If you forget to use your insulin 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See c) Effects 
from diabetes in section 4. If you stop using your insulin<br />
Do not stop using your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis. See c) 
Effects from diabetes in section 4. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>a) Summary of serious and very common side effects  </p>
<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in people.  </p>
<p>Low blood sugar may occur if you:<br />
<em> Inject too much insulin.<br />
</em> Eat too little or miss a meal.<br />
<em> Exercise more than usual.<br />
</em> Drink alcohol (see Drinking alcohol and taking Kirsty in section 2).  </p>
<p>Signs of low blood sugar:<br />
Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary 
changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling 
anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating.  </p>
<p>Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon, you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  </p>
<p>What to do if you experience low blood sugar:  </p>
<p>If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case.  </p>
<p>When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, 
continue insulin treatment as usual.  </p>
<p>If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection 
of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. 
The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted.  </p>
<p>Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink due to risk of suffocation. </p>
<p>Serious allergic reactions to Kirsty or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic reaction) is a 
very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people.  </p>
<p>Seek medical advice immediately:<br />
<em> If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body.<br />
</em> If you suddenly feel unwell, and you start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy.<br />
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately.  </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink 
(lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this 
occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or 
thickened area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. </p>
<p>b) List of other side effects  </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)  </p>
<p>Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of using your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above.  </p>
<p>Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary.  </p>
<p>Swollen joints: When you start using insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Diabetic retinopathy: (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. </p>
<p>Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) </p>
<p>Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. </p>
<p>c) Effects from diabetes  </p>
<p>High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)  </p>
<p>High blood sugar may occur if you:<br />
<em> Have not injected enough insulin.<br />
</em> Forget to inject your insulin or stop using insulin.<br />
<em> Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need.<br />
</em> Get an infection and/or a fever.<br />
<em> Eat more than usual.<br />
</em> Exercise less than usual.  </p>
<p>Warning signs of high blood sugar: The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased 
urination; feeling thirsty; losing your appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or 
tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a fruity (acetone) smell of the breath.  </p>
<p>What to do if you experience high blood sugar:  </p>
<p>If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately.  </p>
<p>These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. </p>         </div>"""
