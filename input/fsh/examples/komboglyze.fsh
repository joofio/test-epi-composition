and metformin, part of a class of medicines called biguanides.
Both belong to a group of medicines called oral anti-diabetics. 
What Komboglyze is used for
This medicine is used to treat a type of diabetes called  type 2 diabetes .
How Komboglyze works
Saxagliptin and metformin work together to control your blood sugar. They increase the levels of 
insulin after a meal. They also lower the amount of sugar made by your body. Along with diet and 
exercise, this helps lower your blood sugar. This medicine can be used alone or together with other
antidiabetic medicines, including insulin.
To control your diabetes, you still need to diet and exercise, even when you are taking this medicine. 
So it is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise from your doctor or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to saxagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6);
-
If you have had a serious allergic (hypersensitive) reaction to any other similar medications that 
you take to control your blood sugar.
Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include:
-
Rash
-
Raised red patches on your skin (hives)
-
Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or 
swallowing.
If you have these symptoms, stop taking this medicine and call your doctor or nurse right 
away.</p>
<p>If you have ever had a diabetic coma;</p>
<p>If you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see  Risk of lactic 
acidosis  below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called  ketone 
bodies  accumulate in the blood and which can lead to a diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell;</p>
<p>If you have severely reduced kidney function or problems with your liver;</p>
<p>If you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your 
blood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems;</p>
<p>If you have a severe infection or are dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your body);</p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding (see also  Pregnancy and breast-feeding );</p>
<p>If you drink a large amount of alcohol (either every day or only from time to time) (please see 
section  Komboglyze with alcohol );
Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions:
Risk of lactic acidosis
Komboglyze may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if 
your kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with 
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further 
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a 
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Komboglyze for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Komboglyze and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you 
experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:</p>
<p>vomiting</p>
<p>stomach ache (abdominal pain)</p>
<p>muscle cramps</p>
<p>a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness</p>
<p>difficulty in breathing</p>
<p>reduced body temperature and heartbeat
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Komboglyze</p>
<p>If you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin). This medicine should not
be used to treat this condition;</p>
<p>If you have or have had a disease of the pancreas;</p>
<p>If you are taking insulin or an antidiabetic medicine known as  sulphonylurea , your doctor may 
want to reduce your dose of insulin or the sulphonylurea when you take either of them together 
with this medicine, in order to avoid low blood sugar;</p>
<p>If you have had allergic reactions to any other medicines that you take to control the amount of 
sugar in your blood;</p>
<p>If you have a problem or take a medicine that can lower your body s defence against infections; </p>
<p>If you have ever had heart failure or you have other risk factors for developing heart failure such 
as problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will advise you of the signs and symptoms of heart 
failure. You should call your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience any of 
these symptoms. Symptoms can include, but are not limited to, increasing shortness of breath, 
rapid increase in weight and swelling of the feet (pedal oedema);
If you need to have major surgery, you must stop taking Komboglyze during and for some time after 
the procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Komboglyze.
Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. Rash has been seen with saxagliptin and 
with certain anti-diabetic medicines in the same class as saxagliptin. Follow the recommendations for 
skin and foot care that your doctor or nurse gave you. Contact your doctor if you encounter blistering 
of the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to
stop Komboglyze.
If any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
this medicine.
Kidney tests or checks
During treatment with this medicine, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year 
or more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Children and adolescents
Komboglyze is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. It is not known if 
this medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Komboglyze
If you need to have an injection of contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Komboglyze before or at the time of 
the injection. Your doctor will decide when you can restart your treatment with Komboglyze.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may 
adjust the dosage of Komboglyze. It is especially important to mention the following:</p>
<p>cimetidine, a medicine used to treat stomach problems</p>
<p>ketoconazole which is used to treat fungal infections</p>
<p>bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma</p>
<p>diltiazem which is used for high blood pressure </p>
<p>rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis </p>
<p>corticosteroids, which are used to treat inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis</p>
<p>carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin, which are used to control fits (seizures) or
long-term pain</p>
<p>medicines which increase urine production (diuretics)</p>
<p>medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as 
ibuprofen and celecoxib)</p>
<p>certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists).
If any of the above apply to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
this medicine.
Komboglyze with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Komboglyze since this may increase the risk of lactic 
acidosis (see  Warnings and precautions ).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. This is because it may affect 
the baby.
Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. This is because metformin 
passes into human milk in small amounts.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Saxagliptin and metformin have a negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hypoglycaemia may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work with safe foothold and there 
is a risk of hypoglycaemia when taking this medicine in combination with medicines known to cause 
hypoglycaemia such as insulin and sulphonylureas.</p>         </div>"""
