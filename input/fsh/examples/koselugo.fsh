Koselugo contains the active substance selumetinib. 
Selumetinib is a type of medicine called a MEK inhibitor. It works by blocking certain proteins 
involved in the growth of tumour cells. 
Koselugo is expected to shrink tumours that grow along nerves, called plexiform neurofibromas. 
These tumours are caused by a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
What Koselugo is used for
Koselugo is used to treat children aged 3 years and above with plexiform neurofibromas that cannot be 
completely removed by surgery.
If you have any questions about how Koselugo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""
