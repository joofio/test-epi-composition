<p>Brodalumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works 
by blocking the activity of IL-17 proteins, which are present at increased levels in diseases such as 
psoriasis. </p>
<p>Kyntheum is used to treat a skin condition called  plaque psoriasis , which causes inflammation and 
scaly plaque formation on the skin. Kyntheum is used in adults with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis affecting large areas of the body. </p>
<p>Using Kyntheum will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and reducing psoriasis 
signs and symptoms, such as itch, redness, scaling, burning, stinging, cracking, flaking and pain. </p>         </div>"""

<li>if you have a long-term (chronic) infection  </li>
<li>if you have tuberculosis (TB), have had a positive TB test, or have been in close contact with 
someone with TB. You may be treated with another medicine for TB before you begin treatment 
with Kyntheum </li>
<li>if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccination. You should not be given 
certain types of vaccines (called  live vaccines ) while being treated with Kyntheum </li>
<li>if you have used Kyntheum during the last three months of your pregnancy, you should talk to 
your doctor before vaccinating your baby </li>
<li>if you are receiving any other treatment for psoriasis, such as another immunosuppressant or 
phototherapy with ultraviolet (UV) light. </li>
</ul>
<p>After starting Kyntheum, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately: 
* if you have been told by your doctor that you have developed Crohn s disease 
* if you feel depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of suicide, or have unusual mood changes 
* if you have an infection or have any signs of infection listed in Section 4  Possible side effects<br />
* if you have been told you have tuberculosis. </p>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis) 
Stop using Kyntheum and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice abdominal 
cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool (any signs of bowel problems). </p>
<p>Look out for allergic reactions 
Kyntheum can potentially cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions. You must look out 
for signs of these conditions while you are taking Kyntheum. </p>
<p>Stop using Kyntheum and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
indicating an allergic reaction. Such signs are listed under  Serious side effects  in section 4. Children and adolescents 
Kyntheum is not recommended for children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) because it has not 
been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kyntheum 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
* if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
* if you have recently had or you or your baby are going to have a vaccination, see "Warnings and 
precautions" in section 2 "What you need to know before using Kyntheum". </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Kyntheum has not been tested in 
pregnant women and it is not known if this medicine can harm your unborn baby. It is therefore 
preferable to avoid the use of Kyntheum during pregnancy. If you are a woman of childbearing 
potential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use adequate contraception while 
using Kyntheum and for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of Kyntheum. </p>
<p>It is not known whether brodalumab passes into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding 
or plan to breast-feed. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or stop 
using Kyntheum. Together you will consider the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit 
of Kyntheum to you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Kyntheum is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
