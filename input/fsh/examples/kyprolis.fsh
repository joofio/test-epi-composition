<p>Carfilzomib works by blocking the proteasome. The proteasome is a system within the cells that 
breaks down proteins when they are damaged or no longer needed. By preventing the breakdown of 
proteins in cancer cells, which are more likely to contain more abnormal proteins, Kyprolis causes the 
death of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Kyprolis is used to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma who have had at least one previous 
treatment for this disease. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells (a type of white blood cell). </p>
<p>Kyprolis will be given to you together with daratumumab and dexamethasone, with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, or only with dexamethasone. Daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone are 
other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma. </p>         </div>"""

during treatment. Before starting Kyprolis, and during treatment, you will undergo blood testing. This 
is to check that you have enough blood cells and your liver and kidneys are working properly. Your 
doctor or nurse will check if you are getting enough fluids. </p>
<p>You must read the package leaflet of all medicines that you take in combination with Kyprolis so that 
you understand the information related to those medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use Kyprolis if you are allergic to carfilzomib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Kyprolis if you have any of the conditions listed below. 
You may need extra tests to check that your heart, kidneys and liver are working properly. </p>
<ul>
<li>Heart problems, including a history of chest pain (angina), heart attack, irregular heartbeat, high 
blood pressure or if you have ever taken a medicine for your heart </li>
<li>Lung problems, including a history of shortness of breath at rest or with activity (dyspnoea) </li>
<li>Kidney problems, including kidney failure or if you have ever received dialysis </li>
<li>Liver problems, including a history of hepatitis, fatty liver, or if you have ever been told your 
liver is not working properly </li>
<li>Unusual bleeding, including easy bruising, bleeding from an injury, such as a cut, that takes 
longer than expected to stop, or internal bleeding such as coughing up blood, vomiting up 
blood, dark tarry stools, or bright red blood in your stools; or bleeding in the brain leading to 
sudden numbness or paralysis on one side of the face, legs or arms, sudden severe headache or 
trouble seeing or difficulty speaking or swallowing. This can indicate you have low numbers of 
platelets (cells that help the blood to clot) </li>
<li>A history of blood clots in your veins </li>
<li>Leg or arm pain or swelling (which could be a symptom of blood clots in the deep veins of the 
leg or arm), chest pain or shortness of breath (which may be a symptom of blood clots in the 
lungs) </li>
<li>Any other major disease for which you were hospitalised or received any medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Conditions you need to look out for </p>
<p>You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Kyprolis to reduce the risk of any 
problems. Kyprolis can make some conditions worse or cause serious side effects, which may be fatal, 
such as heart problems, lung problems, kidney problems, tumour lysis syndrome (a life-threatening 
condition that occurs when cancer cells break and release their content to the bloodstream), reactions 
to the Kyprolis infusion, unusual bruising or bleeding, (including internal bleeding), blood clots in 
your veins, liver problems, certain blood conditions, or a neurological condition known as PRES. See 
 Conditions you need to look out for  in section 4. Tell your doctor if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because this 
medicine could cause hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will check you for signs of 
this infection before, during and for some time after treatment with this medicine. Tell your doctor 
right away if you get worsening tiredness, or yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes. </p>
<p>At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you: experience 
blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way 
you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of 
sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal 
brain condition known as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these 
symptoms prior to treatment with carfilzomib, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kyprolis </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes any medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins or herbal remedies. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking medicines used to prevent pregnancy such as oral 
contraceptives or other hormonal contraceptives, as these may not be suitable for use with Kyprolis. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>For women taking Kyprolis </p>
<p>Do not take Kyprolis if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. 
Treatment with Kyprolis has not been evaluated in pregnant women. While taking Kyprolis, and for 
30 days after stopping treatment you should use a suitable method of contraception to ensure you do 
not become pregnant. You should talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant while taking Kyprolis, notify your doctor or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>Do not take Kyprolis if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if Kyprolis passes into breast milk in 
humans. </p>
<p>Lenalidomide is expected to be harmful to the unborn child. As Kyprolis is given in combination with 
lenalidomide, you must follow the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (see package leaflet for 
lenalidomide for information on pregnancy prevention and discuss with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse). </p>
<p>For men taking Kyprolis </p>
<p>While taking Kyprolis and for 90 days after stopping treatment, you should use a condom even if your 
partner is pregnant. </p>
<p>If your partner becomes pregnant whilst you are taking Kyprolis or within 90 days after stopping 
treatment, notify your doctor or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>While you are being treated with Kyprolis you may experience fatigue, dizziness, fainting, and/or a 
drop in blood pressure. This may impair your ability to drive or operate machines. Do not drive a car 
or operate machines if you have these symptoms. </p>
<p>Kyprolis contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 37 mg sodium per 10 mg vial. This is equivalent to 1.9% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains 109 mg sodium per 30 mg vial. This is equivalent to 5.5% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains 216 mg sodium per 60 mg vial. This is equivalent to 11% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>Kyprolis contains cyclodextrin </p>
<p>This medicine contains 500 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 10 mg vial. This is 
equivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains 1,500 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 30 mg vial. This 
is equivalent to 88 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains 3,000 mg cyclodextrin (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) per 60 mg vial. This

Kyprolis treatment may also be stopped if you experience side effects that cannot be managed. </p>
