disease. It is given for the treatment of non-neurological symptoms of the disease. </p>
<p>Alpha-mannosidosis disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a lack of an enzyme named 
alpha-mannosidase, which is needed to break down certain sugar compounds (called  mannose-rich 
oligosaccharides ) in the body. When this enzyme is missing or does not work properly, these sugar 
compounds build up inside cells and cause the signs and symptoms of the disease. The typical 
manifestations of the disease include distinctive facial features, mental retardation, difficulty in 
controlling movements, difficulties in hearing and speaking, frequent infections, skeletal problems, 
muscle pain and weakness. </p>
<p>Velmanase alfa is designed to replace the missing enzyme in patients with alpha-mannosidosis 
disease.  </p>         </div>"""

section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before Lamzede is used. 
Hypersensitivity reactions may occur with the administration of Lamzede. These reactions usually 
appear during or soon after the infusion and may manifest with several symptoms, such as localised or 
diffuse skin reactions, gastrointestinal symptoms or swelling of the throat, face, lips or tongue (see 
section 4  Possible side effects ). If the hypersensitivity reaction is severe, immediate discontinuation 
of Lamzede is recommended and current medical standards for emergency treatment are to be 
followed. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may be managed by temporary interruption of the 
infusion or by slowing down infusion rate; administration of medicines used to treat allergy may be 
considered by the physician. </p>
<p>If you are treated with Lamzede, you may experience a side effect during or immediately following 
the drip (infusion) used to give the medicine (see section 4  Possible side effects ). This is known as 
an infusion-related reaction and can sometimes be severe. 
- Your doctor may decide to keep you under observation for one hour or longer after the infusion 
in relation to the infusion related reactions. 
- Infusion-related reactions include dizziness, headache, nausea, low blood pressure, tiredness and 
fever. If you experience an infusion-related reaction, you must tell your doctor immediately. 
- If you have an infusion-related reaction you may be given additional medicines to treat or help 
prevent future reactions. These medicines may include medicines used to treat allergies 
(antihistamines), medicines used to treat fever (antipyretics) and medicines to control 
inflammation (corticosteroids). 
- If the infusion-related reaction is severe, your doctor will stop the infusion immediately and 
start giving you appropriate medical treatment. 
- If the infusion-related reactions are severe and/or there is a loss of effect from this medicine, 
your doctor will perform a blood test to check for antibodies that might affect the outcome of 
your treatment. 
- Most of the time you can still be given Lamzede even if you experience an infusion-related 
reaction. </p>
<p>Antibodies may play a role in hypersensitivity and infusion related reactions observed with the use of 
Lamzede. Although 24% of patients developed antibodies against Lamzede during its clinical 
development, no clear correlation was found between antibody titres and reduction in efficacy or 
occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lamzede 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before this medicine is used. </p>
<p>You should not take this medicine during pregnancy unless your doctor states it is clearly necessary. 
Your doctor will discuss that with you. </p>
<p>It is not known whether velmanase alfa passes into breast milk. Lamzede can be used during breast-
feeding since the velmanase alfa will not be absorbed by a breastfed child. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Lamzede has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Lamzede contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose unit, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
