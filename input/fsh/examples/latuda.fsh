antipsychotics. It is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia in adults (aged 18 years and over) and 
adolescents aged 13-17 years. Lurasidone works by blocking receptors in the brain to which the 
substances dopamine and serotonin attach. Dopamine and serotonin are neurotransmitters (substances 
that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other) that are involved in the symptoms of 
schizophrenia. By blocking their receptors, lurasidone helps to normalise the activity of the brain, 
reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is a disorder with symptoms such as hearing things, seeing or sensing things that are not 
there, mistaken beliefs, unusual suspiciousness, becoming withdrawn, incoherent speech and 
behaviour and emotional flatness. People with this disorder may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, 
or tense. This medicine is used to improve your symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>         </div>"""

If you have any of these conditions, please talk to your doctor as he/she may want to adjust your dose, 
monitor you more closely or stop treatment with Latuda. 
Children and adolescents

Other medicines and Latuda
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is especially important if you are taking: </p>
<p>any medicines that also work in the brain, as their effects could be additive in a negative way 
with the effects of Latuda on your brain </p>
<p>medicines that lower blood pressure, as this medicine can also lower blood pressure</p>
<p>medicines for Parkinson s disease and restless legs syndrome (e.g. levodopa) as this medicine 
can reduce their effects</p>
<p>medicines containing ergot alkaloid derivatives (used for treating migraines), and other 
medicines including terfenadine and astemizole (used for treating hay fever and other allergic 
conditions), cisapride (used for treating digestive problems), pimozide (used to treating 
psychiatric illnesses), quinidine (used for treating heart conditions), bepridil (used for treating 
chest pain)</p>
<p>medicines containing buprenorphine (used for treating opioid dependence) or opioids (used for 
treating sever pain) or anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, 
escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, 
amitriptyline, doxepine, or trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Latuda and you 
may experience symptoms such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the 
muscles that control movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive sweating, 
tremor, exaggeration of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature above 38 C. 
Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms.
Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines since your doctor may have to change the dose of 
that medicine during treatment with Latuda.
The following medicines may increase the level of lurasidone in your blood:</p>
<p>diltiazem (to treat high blood pressure)</p>
<p>erythromycin (to treat infections)</p>
<p>fluconazole (to treat fungal infections)</p>
<p>verapamil (to treat high blood pressure or chest pain).
The following medicines may decrease the level of lurasidone in your blood: </p>
<p>amprenavir, efavirenz, etravirine (to treat HIV infection)</p>
<p>aprepitant (to treat nausea and vomiting)</p>
<p>armodafinil, modafinil (to treat sleepiness)</p>
<p>bosentan (to treat high blood pressure or ulcers of the fingers)</p>

<p>rufinamide (to treat seizures). 
Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines since your doctor may change your dose of Latuda.
Latuda with food, drink and alcohol
Alcohol should be avoided when taking this medicine. This is because alcohol will have an additive 
negative effect.
Do not drink grapefruit juice while you are taking this medicine. Grapefruit can affect the way this 
medicine works.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not take this medicine during pregnancy unless this has been agreed with your doctor. 
If your doctor decides that the potential benefit of treatment during pregnancy justifies the potential 
risk to your unborn baby, your doctor will monitor your baby closely after birth. This is because the 
following symptoms may occur in newborn babies of mothers that have used lurasidone in the last 
trimester (last three months) of their pregnancy: </p>
<p>shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and 
difficulty in feeding. 
If your baby develops any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor. 
It is not known if lurasidone passes into breast milk. Talk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding, or if 
you plan to breast-feed. 
Driving and using machines 
Sleepiness, dizziness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see section 
4, Possible side effects). Do not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you know that this 
medicine does not affect you in a negative way.

regularly every day at the same time of the day, so that it is easier to remember it. You must take this 
medicine with food or just after eating, as this helps the body to take up the medicine and allows it to 
work better.

experience sleepiness, tiredness, abnormal body movements, problems with standing and walking, 
dizziness from low blood pressure, and abnormal heart beats.

on the day after the missed dose. If you miss two or more doses, contact your doctor.

If you stop taking this medicine you will lose the effects of the medicine. You should not stop this 
medicine unless told to do so by your doctor as your symptoms may return.
