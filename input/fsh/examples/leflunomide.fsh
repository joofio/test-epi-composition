  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Leflunomide ratiopharm 
- if you have ever had an allergic reaction to leflunomide (especially a serious skin reaction, 
often accompanied by fever, joint pain, red skin stains, or blisters e.g. Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome), to peanut or soya or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6), or if you are allergic to teriflunomide (used to treat multiple sclerosis), 
- if you have any liver problems, 
- if you have moderate to severe kidney problems, 
- if you have severely low numbers of proteins in your blood (hypoproteinaemia), 
- if you suffer from any problem which affects your immune system (e.g. AIDS), 
- if you have any problem with your bone marrow, or if you have low numbers of red or white 
cells in your blood or a reduced number of blood platelets, 
- if you are suffering from a serious infection, 
- if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Leflunomide ratiopharm 
- if you have ever suffered from inflammation of the lung (interstitial lung disease). 
- if you have ever had tuberculosis or if you have been in close contact with someone who has or 
has had tuberculosis. Your doctor may perform tests to see if you have tuberculosis. 
- if you are male and wish to father a child. As it can not be excluded that Leflunomide 
ratiopharm passes into semen, reliable contraception should be used during treatment with 
Leflunomide ratiopharm. Men wishing to father a child should contact their doctor who may 
advise them to stop taking Leflunomide ratiopharm and take certain medicines to remove 
Leflunomide ratiopharm rapidly and sufficiently from their body. You will then need a blood 
test to make sure that Leflunomide ratiopharm has been sufficiently removed from your body, 
and you should then wait for at least another 3 months before attempting to father a child. 
- if you are due to have a specific blood test (calcium level). Falsely low levels of calcium can 
be detected. </p>
<p>Leflunomide ratiopharm can occasionally cause some problems with your blood, liver, lungs or nerves 
in your arms or legs. It may also cause some serious allergic reactions (including Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms [DRESS]), or increase the chance of a severe infection. For 
more information on these, please read section 4 (Possible side effects). </p>
<p>DRESS appears initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high 
temperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type of white 
blood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out blood tests at regular intervals, before and during treatment with 
Leflunomide ratiopharm, to monitor your blood cells and liver. Your doctor will also check your blood 
pressure regularly as Leflunomide ratiopharm can cause an increase in blood pressure. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have unexplained chronic diarrhoea. Your doctor may perform additional tests 
for differential diagnosis. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you develop skin ulcer during treatment with Leflunomide ratiopharm (see also 
section 4). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Leflunomide ratiopharm is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years 
of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Leflunomide ratiopharm 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>This is especially important if you are taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis such as antimalarials (e.g. chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine), intramuscular or oral gold, D-penicillamine, azathioprine and other 
immunosuppressive medicines (e.g. methotrexate) as these combinations are not advisable, </li>
<li>warfarin and other oral medicines used to thin the blood, as monitoring is necessary to reduce 
the risk of side effects of this medicine </li>
<li>teriflunomide for multiple sclerosis </li>
<li>repaglinide, pioglitazone, nateglinide, or rosiglitazone for diabetes </li>
<li>daunorubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or topotecan for cancer </li>
<li>duloxetine for depression, urinary incontinence or in kidney disease in diabetics </li>
<li>alosetron for the management of severe diarrhoea </li>
<li>theophylline for asthma </li>
<li>tizanidine, a muscle relaxant </li>
<li>oral contraceptives (containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) </li>
<li>
<p>cefaclor, benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), ciprofloxacin for infections </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>indomethacin, ketoprofen for pain or inflammation </p>
</li>
<li>furosemide for heart disease (diuretic, water pill) </li>
<li>zidovudine for HIV infection </li>
<li>rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) </li>
<li>sulfasalazine for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis </li>
<li>a medicine called colestyramine (used to reduce high cholesterol) or activated charcoal as 
these medicines can reduce the amount of Leflunomide ratiopharm which is absorbed by the 
body. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are already taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and/or corticosteroids, 
you may continue to take them after starting Leflunomide ratiopharm. </p>
<p>Vaccinations 
If you have to be vaccinated, ask your doctor for advice. Certain vaccinations should not be given 
while taking Leflunomide ratiopharm, and for a certain amount of time after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Leflunomide ratiopharm with food, drink and alcohol 
Leflunomide ratiopharm may be taken with or without food. 
It is not recommended to drink alcohol during treatment with Leflunomide ratiopharm. Drinking 
alcohol while taking Leflunomide ratiopharm may increase the chance of liver damage. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Leflunomide ratiopharm if you are, or think you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant or 
become pregnant while taking Leflunomide ratiopharm, the risk of having a baby with serious birth 
defects is increased. Women of childbearing potential must not take Leflunomide ratiopharm without 
using reliable contraceptive measures. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with Leflunomide 
ratiopharm, as you need to ensure that all traces of Leflunomide ratiopharm have left your body before 
trying to become pregnant. This may take up to 2 years. This may be reduced to a few weeks by taking 
certain medicines which speed up removal of Leflunomide ratiopharm from your body. 
In either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that Leflunomide ratiopharm has been sufficiently 
removed from your body and you should then wait for at least another month before you become 
pregnant. </p>
<p>For further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you suspect that you are pregnant while taking Leflunomide ratiopharm or in the two years after you 
have stopped treatment, you must contact your doctor immediately for a pregnancy test. If the test 
confirms that you are pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with certain medicines to remove 
Leflunomide ratiopharm rapidly and sufficiently from your body, as this may decrease the risk to your 
baby. </p>
<p>Do not take Leflunomide ratiopharm when you are breast-feeding, as leflunomide passes into the 
breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Leflunomide ratiopharm can make you feel dizzy which may impair your ability to concentrate and 
react. If you are affected, do not drive, or use machines. </p>
<p>Leflunomide ratiopharm contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Leflunomide ratiopharm contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>
<p>Leflunomide ratiopharm contains soya lecithin 
If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
