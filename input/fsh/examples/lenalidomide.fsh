Lenalidomide Accord contains the active substance  lenalidomide . This medicine belongs to a group 
of medicines which affect how your immune system works. </p>
<p>What Lenalidomide Accord is used for 
Lenalidomide Accord is used in adults for: 
* Multiple myeloma 
* Myelodysplastic syndromes 
* Mantle cell lymphoma 
* Follicular lymphoma </p>
<p>Multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain kind of white blood cell, called the 
plasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide, becoming out of control. This can 
damage the bones and kidneys.  </p>
<p>Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms can be greatly 
reduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a  response . </p>
<p>Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma   in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant 
Lenalidomide Accord is used on its own as a maintenance therapy after patients have recovered 
enough following a bone marrow transplant. </p>
<p>Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma   in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant 
Lenalidomide Accord is taken with other medicines: These may include: 
* a chemotherapy medicine called  bortezomib<br />
  an anti-inflammatory medicine called  dexamethasone<br />
  a chemotherapy medicine called  melphalan  and 
  an immunosuppressant medicine called  prednisone .<br />
You will take these other medicines at the start of treatment and then continue to take lenalidomide on 
its own. </p>
<p>If you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check 
you carefully before starting treatment. </p>
<p>Multiple myeloma   in patients who have had treatment before 
Lenalidomide Accord is taken together with an anti-inflammatory medicine called  dexamethasone .  </p>
<p>Lenalidomide can stop the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma getting worse. It has also been 
shown to delay multiple myeloma from coming back following treatment.  </p>
<p>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
MDS are a collection of many different blood and bone marrow diseases. The blood cells become 
abnormal and do not function properly. Patients can experience a variety of signs and symptoms 
including a low red blood cell count (anaemia), the need for a blood transfusion, and be at risk of 
infection. </p>
<p>Lenalidomide Accord is used alone to treat adult patients who have been diagnosed with MDS, when 
all of the following apply: 
* you need regular blood transfusions to treat low levels of red blood cells ( transfusion-
dependent anaemia ) 
* you have an abnormality of cells in the bone marrow called an  isolated deletion 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality . This means your body does not make enough healthy blood cells 
* other treatments have been used before, are not suitable or do not work well enough. </p>
<p>Lenalidomide Accord can increase the number of healthy red blood cells that the body produces by 
reducing the number of abnormal cells: 
* this can reduce the number of blood transfusions needed. It is possible that no transfusions 
will be needed. </p>
<p>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
MCL is a cancer of part of the immune system (the lymph tissue). It affects a type of white blood cell 
called  B-lymphocytes  or B-cells. MCL is a disease where B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way and 
build up in the lymph tissue, bone marrow or blood. </p>
<p>Lenalidomide Accord is used alone to treat adult patients who have previously been treated with other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Follicular lymphoma (FL) 
FL is a slow growing cancer that affects the B-lymphocytes. These are a type of white blood cells that 
help your body fight infection. When you have FL, too many of these B-lymphocytes may collect in 
your blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. </p>
<p>Lenalidomide is taken together with another medicine called  rituximab  for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma. </p>
<p>How Lenalidomide Accord works 
Lenalidomide works by affecting the body s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It 
works in a number of different ways: 
* by stopping the cancer cells developing </p>
<ul>
<li>by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer </li>
<li>by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. </li>

Lenalidomide Accord before starting treament with Lenalidomide Accord. </p>
<p>Do not take Lenalidomide Accord: 
* if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, as 
lenalidomide is expected to be harmful to an unborn child (see section 2,  Pregnancy, breast-
feeding and contraception   information for women and men ). 
* if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you 
from becoming pregnant (see section 2,  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception <br />
information for women and men ). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record 
with each prescription that the necessary measures have been taken and provide you with this 
confirmation. 
* if you are allergic to lenalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in 
section 6. If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, do not take lenalidomide. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking lenalidomide 
* if you have had blood clots in the past - you have an increased risk of developing blood clots in 
the veins and arteries during treatment 
* if you have any signs of an infection, such as a cough or fever<br />
* if you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly hepatitis B infection, varicella 
zoster, HIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with lenalidomide may cause the 
virus to become active again, in patients who carry the virus, This results in a recurrence of the 
infection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection 
* if you have kidney problems - your doctor may adjust your dose of lenalidomide if you have had a 
heart attack, have ever had a blood clot, or if you smoke, have high blood pressure or high 
cholesterol levels 
* if you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking thalidomide (another medicine used to treat 
multiple myeloma) such as rash, itching, swelling, dizziness or trouble breathing 
* you have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following symptoms: widespread 
rash, red skin, high body temperature, flu-like symptoms, liver enzyme elevations, blood 
abnormalities (eosinophilia), enlarged lymph nodes   these are signs of a severe skin reaction 
called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS 
or drug hypersensitivity syndrome. (see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before starting treatment. </p>
<p>At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you:<br />
* experience blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a 
change in the way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased 
sensation or loss of sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a 
serious and potentially fatal brain condition known as progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these symptoms prior to treatment with lenalidomide, 
tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. 
* experience shortness of breath, tiredness, dizziness, pain in the chest, a faster heartbeat, or 
swelling in the legs or ankles. These may be symptoms of a serious condition known as 
pulmonary hypertension (see section 4). </p>
<p>Tests and checks 
Before and during the treatment with lenalidomide you will have regular blood tests. This is because 
Lenalidomide Accord may cause a fall in the blood cells that help fight infection (white blood cells) 
and help the blood to clot (platelets).<br />
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
* before treatment<br />
* every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment 
* then at least every month after that. </p>
<p>You may be evaluated for signs of cardiopulmonary problems before and during the treatment with 
lenalidomide. </p>
<p>For patients with MDS taking lenalidomide 
If you have MDS, you may be more likely to get a more advanced condition called acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML). In addition, it is not known how Lenalidomide Accord affects the chances of you 
getting AML. Your doctor may therefore do tests to check for signs which may better predict the 
likelihood of you getting AML during your treatment with Lenalidomide Accord. </p>
<p>For patients with MCL taking lenalidomide 
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
* before treatment 
* every week for the first 8 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment 
* then every 2 weeks in cycles 3 and 4 (see section 3  Treatment cycle  for more information) 
* after this it will happen at the start of each cycle and 
* at least every month. </p>
<p>For patients with FL taking lenalidomide 
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
* before treatment<br />
* every week for the first 3 weeks (1 cycle) of treatment 
* then every 2 weeks in cycles 2 to 4 (see Section 3  Treatment cycle  for more information) 
* After this it will happen at the start of each cycle and 
* at least every month. </p>
<p>Your doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your 
bone marrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels 
of chemicals in the blood which can lead to kidney failure (this condition is called  Tumour Lysis 
Syndrome ).  </p>
<p>Your doctor may check you for changes to your skin such as red spots or rashes. </p>
<p>Your doctor may adjust your dose of lenalidomide or stop your treatment based on the results of your 
blood tests and on your general condition. If you are newly diagnosed, your doctor may also assess 
your treatment based on your age and other conditions you already have. </p>
<p>Blood donation 
You should not donate blood during treatment and for at least 7 days after the end of treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Lenalidomide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years.  </p>
<p>Elderly and people with kidney problems 
If you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check 
you carefully before starting treatment. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lenalidomide Accord 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, or have recently taken any other medicines. This is because 
lenalidomide can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect
