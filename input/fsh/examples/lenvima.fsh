LENVIMA is a medicine that contains the active substance lenvatinib. It is used on its own to treat 
progressive or advanced thyroid cancer in adults when radioactive iodine treatment has not helped to 
stop the disease. </p>
<p>LENVIMA can also be used on its own to treat liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) in adults who 
have not previously been treated with another anticancer medicine that travels through the 
bloodstream. People get LENVIMA when their liver cancer has spread or cannot be taken out by 
surgery. </p>
<p>LENVIMA can also be used together with another anticancer medicine called pembrolizumab to treat 
advanced cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial carcinoma) in adults whose cancer has spread 
after being previously treated with another anticancer medicine that travels through the bloodstream 
and cannot be taken out by surgery or radiation treatment.   </p>
<p>How LENVIMA works 
LENVIMA blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are involved 
in the development of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to cells and help them to 
grow. These proteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action 
LENVIMA may slow the rate at which the cancer cells multiply and the tumour grows and help to cut 
off the blood supply that the cancer needs. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking LENVIMA if you: 
* have high blood pressure<br />
<em> are a woman able to become pregnant (see the section below on Contraception, pregnancy and 
breast-feeding) 
* have a history of heart problems or stroke 
* have liver or kidney problems 
* have had recent surgery or radiotherapy 
* need to have a surgical procedure. Your doctor may consider stopping LENVIMA if you will be 
undergoing a major surgical procedure as LENVIMA may affect wound healing. LENVIMA 
may be restarted once adequate wound healing is established.<br />
</em> are over 75 years<br />
<em> belong to an ethnic group other than White or Asian<br />
</em> weigh less than 60 kg 
* have a history of abnormal connections (known as a fistula) between different organs in the 
body or from an organ to the skin<br />
* If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. 
* have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, 
numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth.  You may be advised to 
have a dental check-up before starting LENVIMA as bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis) 
has been reported in patients treated with LENVIMA.  If you need to undergo an invasive dental 
treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are being treated with LENVIMA, 
particularly when you are also receiving or have received injections of bisphosphonates (used to 
treat or prevent bone disorders). 
* are receiving or have received some medicines used to treat osteoporosis (antiresorptive 
medicines) or cancer medicines which alter formation of blood vessels (so called angiogenesis 
inhibitors), as the risk of bone damage in the jaw may be increased. 
Before taking LENVIMA, your doctor may carry out some tests, for example to check your blood 
pressure and your liver or kidney function and to see if you have low levels of salt and high levels of 
thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. Your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you 
and decide whether you can be given LENVIMA. You may need to have additional treatment with 
other medicines, to take a lower dose of LENVIMA, or to take extra care due to an increased risk of 
side effects. </p>
<p>If you are not sure talk to your doctor before taking LENVIMA. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
LENVIMA is not currently recommended for use in children and adolescents younger than 18 years 
old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and LENVIMA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes herbal preparations and medicines without a prescription. </p>
<p>Contraception, pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
* If you could become pregnant, use highly effective contraception while taking this medicine, 
and for at least one month after you finish treatment. Because it is not known if LENVIMA can 
reduce the effect of the oral contraceptive pill, if this is your normal method of contraception 
you should ensure you also add a barrier method such as the cap or condoms if you have sex 
during treatment with LENVIMA. 
* Do not take LENVIMA if you are planning to become pregnant during your treatment. This is 
because it may seriously harm your baby. 
* If you become pregnant while being treated with LENVIMA, tell your doctor immediately. 
Your doctor will help you decide whether the treatment should be continued. 
* Do not breast-feed if you are taking LENVIMA. This is because the medicine passes into breast 
milk and may seriously harm your breastfed baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
LENVIMA may cause side effects that can affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving 
or using machines if you feel dizzy or tired. </p>         </div>"""

if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>How much to take 
Thyroid cancer 
* The recommended dose of LENVIMA is usually 24 mg once a day<br />
(2 capsules of 10 mg and 1 capsule of 4 mg).<br />
* If you have severe liver or kidney problems the recommended dose is 14 mg once a day<br />
(1 capsule of 10 mg and 1 capsule of 4 mg). 
* Your doctor may reduce your dose if you have problems with side effects.  </p>
<p>Liver cancer 
* The recommended dose of LENVIMA depends on your body weight when you first start 
treatment. The dose is usually 12 mg once a day (3 capsules of 4 mg) if you weigh 60 kg or 
more and 8 mg once a day (2 capsules of 4 mg) if you weigh less than 60 kg.<br />
* Your doctor may reduce your dose if you have problems with side effects. </p>
<p>Uterine cancer 
* The recommended dose of LENVIMA is 20 mg once a day (2 capsules of 10 mg), in 
combination with pembrolizumab. The pembrolizumab is given by your doctor as an injection 
in your vein, either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks. 
* Your doctor may reduce your dose if you have problems with side effects. </p>
<p>Taking this medicine<br />
* You can take the capsules with or without food. 
* Do not open the capsules to avoid exposure to the contents of the capsule. 
* Swallow the capsules whole with water. If you cannot swallow the capsules whole, a liquid 
mixture can be prepared using water, apple juice, or milk. The liquid mixture may be given by 
mouth or through a feeding tube. If given through a feeding tube, then the liquid mixture should 
be prepared using water. If not used at the time of preparation, the liquid mixture may be stored 
in a covered container and must be refrigerated at 2 C to 8 C for a maximum of 24 hours. Shake 
the liquid mixture for 30 seconds after removing from the refrigerator. If the liquid mixture is 
not used within 24 hours of preparation, it should be thrown away. 
Preparation and administration of the liquid mixture: * 
Place the whole capsule(s) corresponding to the prescribed dose (up to 5 capsules) in a 
small container (approximately 20 mL (4 tsp) capacity) or oral syringe (20 mL); do not 
break or crush capsules. * 
Add 3 mL of liquid to the container or oral syringe. Wait 10 minutes for the capsule shell 
(outer surface) to dissolve, then stir or shake the mixture for 3 minutes until the capsules 
are fully dissolved. 
* If liquid mixture is prepared in an oral syringe, cap the syringe, remove plunger 
and use a second syringe or medicine dropper to add the liquid to the first syringe, 
then replace plunger prior to mixing. * 
Drink the liquid mixture from the container or use an oral syringe to take directly into the 
mouth or through a feeding tube. 
* Next, add an additional 2 mL of liquid to the container, or oral syringe using a second syringe or 
dropper, swirl or shake and take the liquid mixture. Repeat this step at least twice and until there 
is no visible sign of the mixture to make sure all of the medication is taken. 
* Take the capsules at about the same time each day. </p>
<p>How long to take LENVIMA 
You will usually carry on taking this medicine as long as you are getting benefit. </p>
<p>If you take more LENVIMA than you should 
If you take more LENVIMA than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away. Take the 
medicine pack with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take LENVIMA 
Do not take a double dose (two doses at the same time) to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>What to do if you forget to take your dose depends on how long it is until your next dose.<br />
<em> If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose: take the missed dose as soon as you remember. 
Then take the next dose at the normal time.<br />
</em> If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose: skip the missed dose. Then take the next dose at 
the normal time.  </p>         </div>"""
