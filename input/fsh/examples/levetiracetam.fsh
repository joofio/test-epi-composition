<p>Levetiracetam ratiopharm is used: 
* on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to 
treat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits 
(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only one 
side of the brain, but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (partial 
onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given to you by 
your doctor to reduce the number of fits. 
* as an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines to treat: </p>
<p>partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents, children and 
infants from one month of age </p>
<p>myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy </p>

adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type
