Libmyris is used to treat:</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis</p>
<p>Enthesitis-related arthritis</p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis</p>
<p>Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis</p>

<p>Plaque psoriasis</p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa</p>
<p>Crohn s disease</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis</p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis
The active substance in Libmyris, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal 
antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target.
The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is involved in the 
immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. 
By attaching to TNF , Libmyris decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases.
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.
Libmyris is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. You may first be given 
other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Libmyris.
Libmyris can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous 
methotrexate treatment.
Libmyris can slow down the damage to the joints caused by the inflammatory disease and can help 
them move more freely.
Your doctor will decide if Libmyris should be used with methotrexate or alone.
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.
Libmyris is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years of age. You 
may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond 
well enough to these medicines, you will be given Libmyris.
Your doctor will decide if Libmyris should be used with methotrexate or alone.
Enthesitis-related arthritis
Enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where tendons join 
the bone.
Libmyris is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years of age. You may first be 
given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to 
these medicines, you will be given Libmyris.
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis are inflammatory diseases of the spine.
Libmyris is used to treat severe ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. You may first be given other medicines. If 
you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Libmyris.
Psoriatic arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that is usually associated with psoriasis.
Libmyris is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Libmyris can slow down the damage to the joints 
caused by the disease and can help them move more freely. You may first be given other medicines. If 
you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Libmyris.
Plaque psoriasis
Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery 
scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift 
away from the nail bed which can be painful.
Libmyris is used to treat</p>
<p>moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults and</p>
<p>severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical 
therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable.
Hidradenitis suppurativa
Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory 
skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. 
It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner 
thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.
Libmyris is used to treat</p>
<p>moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and</p>
<p>moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years
Libmyris can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is 
often associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given Libmyris.
Crohn s disease
Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.
Libmyris is used to treat</p>
<p>moderate to severe Crohn s disease in adults and</p>
<p>moderate to severe Crohn s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.
You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you 
will be given Libmyris.
Ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine.
Libmyris is used to treat </p>
<p>moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and </p>
<p>moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years
You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you 
will be given Libmyris.
Non-infectious uveitis
Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.
Libmyris is used to treat</p>
<p>adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye</p>
<p>children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation affecting the 
front of the eye
This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black 
dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Libmyris works by reducing this 
inflammation.
You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you 
will be given Libmyris.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).</p>
<p>If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see  Warnings and precautions ). It is 
important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, 
wounds, feeling tired, dental problems.</p>
<p>If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Libmyris.
Allergic reactions</p>
<p>If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash, do not inject more Libmyris and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare 
cases, these reactions can be life-threatening.
Infections</p>
<p>If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body 
(for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Libmyris. If you are unsure, contact 
your doctor.</p>
<p>You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Libmyris treatment. This risk may 
increase if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include:<em> tuberculosis</em> infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria* severe infection in the blood (sepsis)
In rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you 
get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you 
to stop using Libmyris for some time.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that 
increase the risk of infections.</p>
<p>If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Libmyris. You 
and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated 
with Libmyris. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as 
fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems.
Tuberculosis</p>
<p>It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have 
been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, 
do not use Libmyris.<em> As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your 
doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Libmyris. 
This will include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and 
appropriate screening tests (for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct 
and results of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card.</em> Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the 
prevention of tuberculosis.* If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack 
of energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your 
doctor immediately.
Hepatitis B</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if 
you think you might be at risk of getting HBV.<em> Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, adalimumab can cause 
the virus to become active again.</em> In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune 
system, reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening.
Surgery or dental procedures</p>
<p>If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking 
Libmyris. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Libmyris.
Demyelinating disease</p>
<p>If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around 
the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue 
to receive Libmyris. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in 
your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body.
Vaccinations</p>
<p>Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Libmyris.<em> Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines.</em> It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for 
their age before they start treatment with Libmyris.* If you received Libmyris while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for 
getting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Libmyris dose 
you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other 
health care professionals about your Libmyris use during your pregnancy so they can 
decide when your baby should receive any vaccine.
Heart failure</p>
<p>If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Libmyris, your heart failure status must 
be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a 
serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. 
shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your 
doctor will decide if you should receive Libmyris.
Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale</p>
<p>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections 
or help you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you develop a fever 
that does not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your 
doctor right away.
Cancer</p>
<p>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking 
adalimumab or other TNF blockers.<em> People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time 
may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph 
system) and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).</em> If you take Libmyris the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may 
increase. On rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma has been seen in 
patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 
6-mercaptopurine.<em> Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Libmyris.</em> Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab.* If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change 
appearance, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF 
blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor 
whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.
Autoimmune disease</p>
<p>On rare occasions, treatment with Libmyris could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your 
doctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur.
Children and adolescents</p>
<p>Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
Libmyris.
Other medicines and Libmyris
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
You should not take Libmyris with medicines containing the following active substances due to 
increased risk of serious infection:</p>
<p>anakinra</p>
<p>abatacept.
Libmyris can be taken together with:</p>
<p>methotrexate</p>
<p>certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations)</p>
<p>steroids or pain medicine including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
If you have questions, please ask your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its 
use for at least 5 months after the last Libmyris treatment.</p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice about taking this medicine.</p>
<p>Libmyris should only be used during a pregnancy if needed.</p>
<p>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did 
not receive adalimumab.</p>
<p>Libmyris can be used during breast-feeding.</p>
<p>If you receive Libmyris during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection.</p>
<p>It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals about your 
Libmyris use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more 
information on vaccines see the  Warnings and precautions  section.
Driving and using machines
Libmyris may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning 
sensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking Libmyris.
