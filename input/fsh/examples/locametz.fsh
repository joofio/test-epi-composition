This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. </p>
<p>Locametz contains a substance called gozetotide. Before use, gozetotide (the powder in the vial) is 
coupled with a radioactive substance called gallium-68 to make gallium (68Ga) gozetotide solution 
(this procedure is called radiolabelling). </p>
<p>What Locametz is used for 
After radiolabelling with gallium-68, Locametz is used in a medical imaging procedure called positron 
emission tomography (PET) to detect specific types of cancer cells with a protein called 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in adults with prostate cancer. This is done:</p>
<ul>
<li>to find out whether prostate cancer has spread to lymph nodes and other tissues outside the 
prostate, before primary curative therapy (e.g. therapy involving surgical removal of the 
prostate, radiation therapy) </li>
<li>to identify cancer cells when recurrence of prostate cancer is suspected in patients who have 
received primary curative therapy </li>
<li>to find out whether patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer may 
be suitable for a specific therapy, called PSMA-targeted therapy </li>
</ul>
<p>How Locametz works 
When given to the patient, gallium (68Ga) gozetotide binds to the cancer cells that have PSMA on their 
surface and makes them visible to your nuclear medicine doctor during the PET medical imaging 
procedure. This gives your doctor and nuclear medicine doctor valuable information about your 
disease. </p>
<p>The use of gallium (68Ga) gozetotide involves exposure to a small amount of radioactivity. Your 
doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain 
from the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Locametz works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your nuclear medicine doctor. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you receive Locametz if you have any other type of 
cancer, as this could affect the interpretation of the image. </p>
<p>The use of Locametz involves exposure to a small amount of radioactivity. Repeated exposure to 
radiation may increase the risk of cancer. Your nuclear medicine doctor will explain necessary 
radioprotection measures to you (see section 3). </p>
<p>Before administration of Locametz you should 
- Drink plenty of water so that you remain hydrated and urinate immediately before the PET 
medical imaging procedure, and as often as possible during the first hours after administration. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to children or adolescents aged under 18 years because no data are 
available in this age group. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Locametz is not intended for use in women. All radiopharmaceuticals, including Locametz, have the 
potential to cause harm to an unborn baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Locametz will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>
<p>Locametz contains sodium 
This medicine contains 28.97 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each injection. 
This is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Locametz will 
only be used in special controlled areas. This radiopharmaceutical product will only be handled and 
given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special 
care for the safe use of this radiopharmaceutical product and will keep you informed of their actions. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Locametz to be 
used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. </p>
<p>The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult is 1.8-2.2 MBq (megabecquerel, 
the unit used to express radioactivity) per kg of body weight, with a minimum amount of 111 MBq 
and a maximum of 259 MBq. </p>
<p>Administration of Locametz and conduct of the procedure 
After reconstitution and radiolabelling, Locametz is given as a slow injection into a vein. You will 
undergo a PET scan starting 50 to 100 minutes after you have received Locametz. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. </p>
<p>After administration of Locametz, you should 
- Continue to drink plenty of water so that you remain hydrated and urinate as often as possible to 
eliminate the radiopharmaceutical product from your body. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more Locametz than you should 
An overdose of Locametz is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose that is precisely 
controlled by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the event of an 
overdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. You may be asked to drink and urinate frequently 
in order to eliminate the radiopharmaceutical product from your body. </p>
<p>Should you have any further question on the use of Locametz, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""
