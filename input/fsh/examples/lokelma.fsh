Lokelma is used to treat hyperkalaemia in adults. Hyperkalaemia means that there is a high level of 
potassium in the blood.
Lokelma lowers the high levels of potassium in your body and helps to keep it at a normal level. As 
Lokelma passes through your stomach and gut it attaches to potassium and the two are carried together 
out of the body in your stools, lowering the amount of potassium in the body.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions 
Monitoring
Your doctor or nurse will check your blood potassium level when you start taking this medicine:</p>
<p>This is to make sure you are getting the correct dose. The dose may be raised or lowered based 
on your blood potassium level.</p>
<p>Treatment may be stopped if your blood potassium level becomes too low.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines which can change your blood 
potassium levels because your dose of Lokelma may need to be changed. These include
diuretics (medicines that increase urine production), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors such as enalapril, angiotensin receptor blockers such as valsartan (medicines for high
blood pressure and for heart problems), and renin inhibitors such as aliskiren (for high blood
pressure).
While you are taking Lokelma, tell your doctor or nurse if</p>
<p>you have a heart signaling disorder (QT prolongation) since Lokelma lowers your blood 
potassium levels which may affect heart signaling. </p>
<p>you need to have an X-ray, as Lokelma may affect the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>you have sudden or severe pain in your abdomen as this may be a sign of a problem that is 
observed with medicines that work in the gastrointestinal tract.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because the 
effects of Lokelma in children and adolescents are not known.
Other medicines and Lokelma
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Lokelma may affect how certain medicines are absorbed from your digestive tract. If you are taking 
any of the following medicines, they should be taken 2 hours before or after taking Lokelma, 
otherwise they may not work properly.</p>
<p>tacrolimus (medicines used to suppress your body s immune system to prevent organ transplant 
rejection)</p>
<p>ketoconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole (used to treat fungal infections)</p>
<p>atazanavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, raltegravir, ledipasvir and rilpivirine
(used to treat HIV infection)</p>
<p>tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, dasatinib and nilotinib (used to treat cancer)
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking this medicine.
Pregnancy and breast feeding
Pregnancy
Do not use this medicine during pregnancy because there is no information on its use in pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast-
feeding woman to Lokelma is negligible. Lokelma can be used during breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.
Lokelma contains sodium
This medicine contains approximately 400 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
5 g dose. This is equivalent to 20% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for
an adult.
Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you need Lokelma 5 g or more daily for a prolonged period, 
especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.</p>         </div>"""

more until you have spoken to a doctor.
If you forget to take Lokelma </p>
<p>If you forget to take a dose of this medicine, skip the missed dose.</p>
<p>Then take the next dose as usual at your normal time.</p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Lokelma
Do not reduce the dose of this medicine or stop taking it without talking to the doctor who prescribed 
it. This is because you may get high potassium levels in your blood again.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
