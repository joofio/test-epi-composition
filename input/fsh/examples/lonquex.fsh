  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Lonquex is 
Lonquex contains the active substance lipegfilgrastim. Lipegfilgrastim is a long-acting modified 
protein produced by biotechnology in bacteria called Escherichia coli. It belongs to a group of proteins 
called cytokines and is similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) 
produced by your own body. </p>
<p>What Lonquex is used for 
Lonquex is used in adults and in children aged 2 years and older. </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed Lonquex for you or for your child in order to reduce the duration of a 
condition called neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia 
(low white blood cell count with a fever). These can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(medicines that destroy rapidly-growing cells). </p>
<p>How Lonquex works 
Lipegfilgrastim stimulates the bone marrow (the tissue where new blood cells are made) to produce 
more white blood cells. White blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection. These 
cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in 
your body to decrease. If white blood cells fall to a low level, there may not be enough left in the body 
to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. </p>         </div>"""

* if you or your child are allergic to lipegfilgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lonquex: 
* if you or your child get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. It could be 
a consequence of a spleen disorder (see section 4  Possible side effects ). 
* if you or your child have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. It could be a consequence of a 
pulmonary disorder (see section 4  Possible side effects ). 
* if you or your child have sickle cell anaemia, which is an inherited disease characterised by 
sickle-shaped red blood cells. 
* if you or your child have previously experienced allergic reactions to other medicines like this 
one (e.g. filgrastim, lenograstim or pegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). There could be a risk 
of reacting to Lonquex too. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests in order to monitor various blood components and their 
levels. Your doctor will also check your or your child`s urine regularly as other medicines similar to 
this one (e.g. other granulocyte colony stimulating factors such as filgrastim, lenograstim or 
pegfilgrastim) can possibly harm the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis; see section 4. Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your child are being treated for breast or lung cancer in combination 
with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and experience symptoms such as tiredness, fever, 
and easy bruising or bleeding. These symptoms could be a consequence of a precancerous blood 
condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or of a blood cancer called acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) which have been associated with another medicine like this one (pegfilgrastim 
of the group of G-CSFs). </p>
<p>Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) 
has been reported rarely with other medicines like this one (e.g. filgrastim, lenograstim or 
pegfilgrastim of the group of G-CSFs). The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, 
back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Lonquex is not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lonquex 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any 
other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Lonquex has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as the doctor may decide that you should 
not use this medicine. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether the active substance in this medicine passes into the breast milk. You should 
therefore interrupt breast-feeding during treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Lonquex has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Lonquex contains sorbitol 
This medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe. </p>
<p>Lonquex contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>What the recommended dose is 
The recommended dose is one pre-filled syringe (6 mg lipegfilgrastim) once per chemotherapy cycle. </p>
<p>The pre-filled syringe is only suitable for adults or for children weighing 45 kg and more. </p>
<p>Lonquex is also available in a vial presentation for children weighing less than 45 kg. The 
recommended dose will be based on their body weight and the adequate dose will be given by a doctor 
or a nurse. </p>
<p>When to use Lonquex 
The Lonquex dose will normally be injected approximately 24 hours after the last dose of 
chemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. </p>
<p>How are the injections given? 
This medicine is given as an injection using a pre-filled syringe. The injection is given into the tissue 
just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). </p>
<p>Your doctor may suggest that you learn how to inject yourself with this medicine or how to give the 
injection to your child. Your doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to do this. Do not 
attempt to give Lonquex to yourself or to your child without this training. Information required for 
using the pre-filled syringe can be found under  Information for injecting yourself or your child . 
Proper treatment of your or of your child s disease, however, requires close and constant co-operation 
with your doctor. </p>
<p>Information for injecting yourself or your child </p>
<p>This section contains information on how to give yourself or your child an injection of Lonquex under 
the skin. It is important that you do not try to give yourself or your child the injection unless you have 
received special training from your doctor or nurse. If you are not sure about giving yourself or your 
child the injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. </p>
<p>How Lonquex is used 
You will need to give yourself or your child the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is 
known as a subcutaneous injection. </p>
<p>Equipment that you need 
To give yourself or your child an injection into the tissue under the skin you will need: 
* a pre-filled syringe of Lonquex, 
* an alcohol wipe, 
* a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab, 
* a puncture-proof container (plastic container provided by the hospital or pharmacy) so you can 
dispose of used syringes safely. </p>
<p>What you should do before the injection 
1. Take the medicine out of the refrigerator. 
2. Open the blister and take the pre-filled syringe out of the blister (see picture 1). Do not pick up 
the pre-filled syringe by the plunger or needle cover. 
3. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed 
the last day of the month shown. 
4. Check the appearance of Lonquex. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles 
in it or if it is cloudy, you must not use it. 
5. Do not shake Lonquex vigorously as this may affect its activity. 
6. For a more comfortable injection:<br />
* let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room temperature (not above 
25  C) or 
* hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. 
Do not warm Lonquex in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot 
water). 
7. Do not remove the needle cover from the syringe until you are ready to inject. 
8. Find a comfortable, well-lit place. Put everything you need within easy reach (the Lonquex 
pre-filled syringe, an alcohol wipe, a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab and the 
puncture-proof container). 
9. Wash your hands thoroughly. </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Where the injection should be given 
The most suitable places for the injection are: 
* the top of the thighs, 
* the abdomen (see grey areas in picture 2) avoiding the skin directly surrounding the navel. </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>If someone else is injecting you or if you are injecting your child, the following places can also be 
used: 
* the back and side of the upper arms (see grey areas in pictures 3 and 4). </p>
<p>3 
4 </p>
<p>How to prepare for the injection 
Before you give yourself or your child a Lonquex injection, you must do the following: 
1. Disinfect the injection site on the skin by using an alcohol wipe. 
2. Hold the syringe and gently remove the cover from the needle without twisting. Pull straight as 
shown in pictures 5 and 6. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. </p>

<ol>
<li>You may notice small air bubbles in the pre-filled syringe. If there are air bubbles present, hold 
the syringe with the needle pointing upwards (see picture 7), gently tap the syringe with your 
fingers until the air bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. With the syringe pointing upwards, 
expel all air from the syringe by pushing the plunger slowly upwards. </li>
</ol>
<p>7 </p>
<ol>
<li>You can now use the pre-filled syringe. </li>
</ol>
<p>How you should inject yourself or your child 
1. Pinch the disinfected skin between your thumb and forefinger, without squeezing it (see 
picture 8). 
2. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your doctor or nurse. The angle between the 
syringe and skin should not be too narrow (at least 45 , see picture 9). 
3. Inject the liquid into the tissue slowly and evenly, always keeping the skin pinched. 
4. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle and let go of the skin. 
5. Press the injection site with a piece of gauze bandage or a sterile gauze swab for several 
seconds. 
6. Only use each syringe for one injection. Do not use any Lonquex that is left in the syringe. </p>

<p>Most serious side effects </p>
<ul>
<li>Allergic reactions such as skin rash, raised itchy areas of skin and serious allergic reactions with 
weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing and swelling of the face have been 
reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If you think you are having this type 
of reaction, you must stop your Lonquex injection and get medical help immediately. </li>
<li>Increased spleen size has been reported uncommonly  and cases of splenic ruptures have been 
reported with other medicines similar to Lonquex. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. It is 
important to contact your doctor immediately if you experience pain in the upper left side of the 
abdomen or left shoulder pain since this may relate to a problem with your spleen. </li>
<li>Cough, fever and difficult or painful breathing can be signs of uncommon  serious pulmonary 
side effects, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may be fatal. If 
you have a fever or any of these symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor immediately.  </li>
<li>It is important to contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms: 
swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty 
breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These 
symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. 
These could be symptoms of a condition reported with frequency not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data), called  capillary leak syndrome , which causes blood to leak 
from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other side effects </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
* Musculoskeletal pains such as bone pain and pain in the joints, muscles, limbs, chest, neck or 
back. Tell your doctor if you experience severe musculoskeletal pain. 
* Nausea. </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* Reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising. 
* Headache. 
* Skin reactions, such as redness or rash. 
* Low blood levels of potassium, which can cause muscle weakness, twitching or abnormal heart 
rhythm. 
* Chest pain. 
* Coughing up blood. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* Rise in white blood cells. 
* Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain or hardening. 
* Some changes may occur in your blood, but these will be detected by routine blood tests. 
* Bleeding from the lung. </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): 
* Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the 
body), see section 2. Side effects that have been seen with similar medicines, but not yet with Lonquex 
* Sickle cell crises in patients with sickle cell anaemia. 
* Plum-coloured raised painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with fever
