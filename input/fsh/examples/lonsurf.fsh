  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Lonsurf is a type of cancer chemotherapy which belongs to the group of medicines called "cytostatic 
antimetabolite medicines". </p>
<p>Lonsurf contains two different active substances: trifluridine and tipiracil. 
  Trifluridine stops the growth of cancer cells. 
  Tipiracil stops the trifluridine from being broken down by the body, helping trifluridine to work 
longer. </p>
<p>Lonsurf is used to treat adults with colon or rectal cancer - sometimes called  colorectal  cancer and 
stomach cancer (including cancer of the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach).<br />
  It is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastases).<br />
  It is used when other treatments have not worked - or when other treatments are not suitable for 
you. 
Lonsurf may be given in combination with bevacizumab. It is important that you also read the package 
leaflet of bevacizumab. If you have any questions about this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

  if you are allergic to trifluridine or tipiracil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Do not take Lonsurf if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before taking 
Lonsurf. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lonsurf if: 
  you have kidney problems 
  you have liver problems 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lonsurf.<br />
Treatment may lead to the following side effects (see section 4): 
*  a reduced number of certain types of white blood cells (neutropenia) which are important for 
protecting the body against bacterial or fungal infections. As a consequence of neutropenia, fever 
(febrile neutropenia) and blood infection (septic shock) may occur<br />
<em> a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia)<br />
</em> a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) which are important to stop 
bleeding and work by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries<br />
* gastrointestinal problems. 
Tests and checks 
Your doctor will do blood tests before each cycle of Lonsurf. You start a new cycle every 4 weeks. 
The tests are needed because Lonsurf can sometimes affect your blood cells. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. This is 
because it may not work or be safe. 
Other medicines and Lonsurf 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Lonsurf can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect 
the way Lonsurf works. 
In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines used for treatment of HIV, such 
as zidovudine. This is because zidovudine may not work as well if you are taking Lonsurf. Talk to 
your doctor about whether to switch to a different HIV medicine. 
If the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Lonsurf. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Lonsurf may harm your 
unborn baby.<br />
If you become pregnant, you and your doctor will have to decide if the benefits of Lonsurf are greater 
than the risk of harm to the baby.<br />
Do not breast-feed if you are taking Lonsurf as it is not known whether Lonsurf passes into the 
mother s milk. </p>
<p>Contraception 
You must not become pregnant while taking this medicine. This is because it may harm your unborn 
baby.<br />
You and your partner should use effective methods of contraception while taking this medicine. You 
should also do this for 6 months after you stop taking the medicine. If you or your partner become 
pregnant during this time, you must talk to your doctor or pharmacist straight away. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Lonsurf may affect your ability to have a baby. Talk to your doctor for advice before using it. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not known whether Lonsurf changes your ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use any 
tools or machines if you experience symptoms that affect your ability to concentrate and react.  </p>
<p>Lonsurf contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
