LUMIGAN eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye. This medicine may be used on its 
own or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure.
Your eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being 
drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly 
enough, the pressure inside the eye builds up. This medicine works by increasing the amount of liquid 
that is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. If the high pressure is not reduced, it could 
lead to a disease called glaucoma and eventually damage your sight.</p>         </div>"""

6).
-
if you have had to stop using eye drops in the past because of a side effect of the preservative 
benzalkonium chloride.
Warnings and precautions:
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml
Talk to your doctor, if:
-
You have any breathing problems
-
You have liver or kidney problems
-
You have had a cataract surgery in the past
-
You have dry eye
-
You have or have had any problems with your cornea (front transparent part of the eye) 
-
You wear contact lenses (see  LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride )
-
You have or have had low blood pressure or low heart rate
-
You have had a viral infection or inflammation of the eye
During treatment, LUMIGAN may cause a loss of fat around the eye, which may cause your eyelid 
crease to deepen, your eye to appear sunken (enophthalmos), your upper eyelid to droop (ptosis), the 
skin around your eye to tighten (involution of dermatochalasis) and the lower white part of your eye to 
become more visible (inferior scleral show). The changes are typically mild, but if pronounced, they 
can affect your field of vision. The changes may disappear if you stop taking LUMIGAN. LUMIGAN
may also cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too. 
The colour of your iris may also go darker. These changes may be permanent. The changes may be 
more noticeable if you are only treating one eye.
Children and adolescents
LUMIGAN has not been tested in children under the age of 18 and therefore should not be used by 
patients under 18 years.
Other medicines and LUMIGAN
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
LUMIGAN may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you are taking LUMIGAN.
Driving and using machines
Your sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN. You should not drive or 
use machines until your sight is clear again.
LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains benzalkonium chloride
This medicine contains 0.6 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to 
0.2 mg/ml.
Do not use the drops when you are wearing your lenses. A preservative in LUMIGAN, benzalkonium 
chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the contact lenses.  You 
should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and wait 15 minutes after using the drops 
before you put your lenses back in. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if 
you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye).  If you feel 
abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
LUMIGAN should only be applied to the eye. The recommended dose is one drop of LUMIGAN in 
the evening, once daily in each eye that needs treatment.
If you use LUMIGAN with another eye medicine, wait at least five minutes between using 
LUMIGAN and the other eye medicine.
Do not use more than once a day as the effectiveness of treatment may be reduced.
Instructions for use:
You must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it. 
1. Wash your hands. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling.
2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket.
3. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs treatment.
4. Let go of the lower lid, and close your eye for 30 seconds.
Wipe off any excess that runs down the cheek.
If a drop misses your eye, try again.
To help prevent infections and avoid eye injury, do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or 
anything else. Put the cap back on and close the bottle straight after you have used it.
If you use more LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml than you should
If you use more LUMIGAN than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your 
next dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you forget to use LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml 
If you forget to use LUMIGAN, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your 
regular routine. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml
LUMIGAN should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using LUMIGAN the pressure 
inside your eye may go up, therefore talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
