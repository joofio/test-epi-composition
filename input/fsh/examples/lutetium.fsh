contains the active substance lutetium (177Lu) chloride which gives off beta-minus radiation. </p>
<p>Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is not intended to be used on its own. Before use it has to be 
combined with other medicines (so called carrier medicines) that have been specially developed for 
use with lutetium (177Lu) chloride. This process is called radiolabelling. </p>
<p>These carrier medicines may be substances that have been designed to recognise a particular type of 
cell in the body. The carrier medicine is given to the patient according to the instructions in that 
medicine s product information. It then carries the radiation to where it is needed in the body, to treat 
disease or to obtain images on a screen that are used to diagnose illness. </p>
<p>The use of a medicine radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev does involve exposure to 
radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of 
using Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev outweighs the risk due to radiation. </p>

- if you are allergic to lutetium (177Lu) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
- if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. </p>
<p>For more information, refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is not to be administered directly to patients. 
Take special care with the medicine that is radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have renal impairment or bone marrow disease. </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) may lead to the following side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia); </li>
<li>a reduced number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), which are important to stop bleeding; </li>
<li>a reduced number of white blood cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are 
important for protecting the body against infection. </li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these events are mild and temporary. A reduced number of all 3 types of blood cells (red 
blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells - pancytopenia) has been described in some patients. 
Treatment has to be stopped in patients with pancytopenia. </p>
<p>Because lutetium (177Lu) can sometimes affect your blood cells, your doctor will do blood tests before 
you start and at regular intervals during treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience shortness of 
breath, bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding from your gums, or if you develop a fever. </p>
<p>When this medicine is used to radiolabel carrier medicines called somatostatin analogues used to treat 
cancers called neuroendocrine tumours, the radiolabelled carrier medicine is excreted by the kidneys. 
Your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your kidney function before you start and 
during treatment. </p>
<p>Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) may affect the way your liver works. Your doctor will take a blood 
test to check your liver function during treatment. </p>
<p>Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicines may be given directly into a vein through a tube known as a 
cannula. There have been reports of leakage of the fluid into the surrounding tissue (extravasation). 
Tell your doctor if you get any swelling or pain in your arm. </p>
<p>After neuroendocrine tumours are treated with lutetium (177Lu), you may get symptoms associated 
with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as a carcinoid crisis. Tell your doctor if you 
feel faint or dizzy or have flushing or diarrhoea following your treatment.  </p>
<p>Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, a condition resulting from the 
rapid breakdown of tumour cells. This may lead to abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, 
kidney failure or seizures within a week of treatment. Your doctor will carry out blood tests to monitor 
you for this syndrome. Tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or 
shortness of breath. </p>
<p>Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev for additional warnings and precautions. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor if you are under 18 years old. 
Use of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev in children and adolescents under 18 years old depends on the 
medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev. Please refer to the Package 
Leaflet of that medicine. </p>
<p>Other medicines and medicines radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev<br />
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines since they may interfere with the procedure. 
It is not known whether lutetium (177Lu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific studies 
have not been carried out. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of medicines radiolabelled 
with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have 
missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. 
When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the 
procedure. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant 
Medicines radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev must not be administered if you are 
pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding 
You will be asked to stop breast-feeding. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can 
resume breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the medicine used in 
combination with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev. Please read the package leaflet of that medicine 
carefully. </p>         </div>"""

<p>After administration of the medicine radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev

overdose. However, in the case of an overdose, you will receive appropriate treatment as necessary. </p>

respectively, with a Teflon coated chlorobutyl rubber stopper, closed with an aluminum cap. 
The vials are placed into a lead container for protective shielding and packed into a polystyrene box 
and an outer carton.  </p>
<p>Pack sizes:<br />
5 mL vial: 1, 2 or 3 vials<br />
10 mL vial: 1, 2 or 3 vials  </p>
<p>Not all pack sizes may be marketed. </p>
<p>The volume of one vial ranges from 0.1-8 mL solution (corresponding to 5.2-414.4 GBq at activity 
reference time). The volume depends on the quantity of medicine combined with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev required for administration by the nuclear medicine doctor. </p>
