  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Luveris is 
Luveris is a medicine containing lutropin alfa, a recombinant Luteinising Hormone (LH) which is 
essentially similar to the hormone found naturally in humans, but is made by means of biotechnology. 
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotropins, which are involved in the normal control of 
reproduction. </p>
<p>What Luveris is used for 
Luveris is recommended for the treatment of adult women who have been shown to produce very low 
levels of some of the hormones involved in the natural reproductive cycle. The medicine is used 
together with another hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone, (FSH), to bring about the 
development of follicles, which are in the ovary, the structures maturing the eggs (ova). It is followed 
by treatment with a single dose of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), which leads to the release 
of an egg from the follicle (ovulation). </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Luveris 
* if you are allergic to gonadotropins (such as luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone 
or human chorionic gonadotropin), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* if you have cancer of ovaries, uterus or breast. 
* if you have had a brain tumour diagnosed. 
* if you have ovarian enlargement or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cyst) of unknown 
origin. 
* if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding. </p>
<p>Do not use Luveris if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Luveris. 
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started. </p>
<p>It is recommended not to use Luveris if you have any condition that usually makes a normal 
pregnancy impossible, such as ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian 
failure, or malformations of sexual organs. </p>
<p>Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome or OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large 
cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you 
have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this 
medicine (see section 4 under  Serious side effects ). </p>
<p>In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. Luveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. This 
becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human 
Chorionic Gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see section 3 under  How much to use  for details). If 
you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may 
be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ensure careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood 
sampling before and during the course of treatment. </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy 
When using Luveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time ( multiple pregnancy , mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Luveris at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technologies, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. </p>
<p>Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technologies or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. </p>
<p>Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy where the embryo 
is implanted outside the womb), whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with 
fertility treatments. </p>
<p>Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Luveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots 
in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots 
or existing clots might become worse with Luveris treatment. </p>
<p>Tumours of sexual organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment. </p>
<p>Birth defects 
Birth defects after assisted reproductive technologies may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This could be due to differences in parental factors like maternal age, genetics, as well as 
the assisted reproductive technology procedures and multiple pregnancy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Luveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Luveris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use Luveris as a mixture with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, 
if prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Luveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Luveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Luveris contains sodium 
Luveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

sure. </p>
<p>Using this medicine 
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration, which are most appropriate for 
you during this course of treatment. </p>
<p>More user-friendly presentations are available for self-administration by patients at home. Consult 
your doctor to find out if a more suitable alternative may be available for you. </p>
<p>How much to use 
Luveris is usually used every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of FSH. 
* The usual starting dose is 75 IU (1 vial) of Luveris together with 75 IU or 150 IU of FSH. 
* According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of FSH by preferably 37.5 to 
75 IU at 7- to 14-day intervals. </p>
<p>Your physician may decide to extend your treatment up to 5 weeks. </p>
<p>When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24 to 48 hours after 
the last injections of Luveris and FSH. You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, 
and the day following, administration of the hCG. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another 
medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor s judgment. </p>
<p>If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4 
under  Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). For the following cycle, your doctor will 
prescribe FSH at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
Luveris is intended for subcutaneous use which means it is given by injection under the skin. Each vial 
is for single use only. </p>
<p>If you administer Luveris to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions: 
* Wash your hands. It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assemble everything you need. Find a clean area and lay out everything:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one vial of Luveris, </p>
</li>
<li>one ampoule of solvent, </li>
<li>two alcohol swabs, </li>
<li>one syringe, </li>
<li>one reconstitution needle for dissolving the powder in the solvent, </li>
<li>a fine-bore needle for subcutaneous injection, </li>
<li>
<p>a sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the ampoule of solvent: On the head of the solvent ampoule, you will see a small 
coloured dot. Directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>easier to break. Gently flick the top section of the ampoule 
so that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the 
bottom chamber. Now press the ampoule firmly over the 
neck, and break the ampoule away from the coloured dot. 
Carefully place the open ampoule upright on the work-
surface. 
* Draw up the solvent: Attach the reconstitution needle to the syringe, with the syringe in  </p>
<p>one hand, pick up the open ampoule, insert the needle and 
draw up all of the solvent. </p>
<p>Carefully set the syringe down on the work-surface, taking 
care not to touch the needle. 
* Prepare the injection solution: Remove the protective cap from the Luveris powder vial, pick  </p>
<p>up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the vial 
of Luveris. Swirl gently without removing the syringe. Do 
not shake. </p>
<ul>
<li>After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting  </li>
</ul>
<p>solution is clear and does not contain any particles. Turn 
the vial upside down and gently draw the solution back 
into the syringe. 
You may also mix Luveris and follitropin alfa as an alternative to injecting each product separately. 
After dissolving the Luveris powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the 
container with the follitropin alfa powder. Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into 
the syringe. Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear. </p>
<p>Up to 3 containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 mL of solvent. </p>
<ul>
<li>Change the needle for the fine-bore needle and remove any air bubbles: If you see air bubbles </li>
</ul>
<p>in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing 
upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air 
collects at the top. Gently push the plunger until the air 
bubbles are gone. </p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to 
inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab. Firmly pinch the </li>
</ul>
<p>skin together and insert the needle at a 45  to 
90  angle using a dart-like motion. Inject under the 
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into 
a vein. Inject the solution by pushing gently on the 
plunger. Take as much time as you need to inject 
all the solution. Immediately withdraw the needle 
and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a 
circular motion. </p>
<p>Dispose of all used items: Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and 
empty glass containers in the sharps container provided. Any unused solution must be discarded. </p>
<p>If you use more Luveris than you should 
The effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome may occur (see section 4). However, this will only occur if hCG is 
administered (see section 2 under  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>If you forget to use Luveris 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Allergic reaction 
Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can 
sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
* Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Your ovaries may have over-reacted to the treatment and 
formed large sacs of fluid or cysts (see section 2 under  Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS) ). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). If this happens, your 
doctor will need to examine you as soon as possible. 
* Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) usually with severe OHSS are 
found very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see 
section 2 under  Blood clotting problems ). </p>
<p>Other common side effects 
* Headache 
* Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain 
* Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts), breast pain and pelvic pain 
* Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, itching, bruising, swelling or irritation </p>
<p>Torsion of the ovary and bleeding into the abdomen have not been reported with Luveris, however, 
there have been rare cases reported following treatment with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), 
a urine-derived medication also containing LH. </p>
<p>Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a 
history of prior tubal disease. </p>
