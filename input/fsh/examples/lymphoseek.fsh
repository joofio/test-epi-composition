oral cavity cancers to help find out about your illness. It is not a treatment for your illness.  </p>
<p>Before it is used, the powder in the vial which contains tilmanocept is mixed with a radioactive medicine 
called sodium pertechnetate (containing 99mTc) to make a substance called technetium (99mTc) tilmanocept. </p>
<p>Since technetium (99mTc) tilmanocept contains a small amount of radioactivity it can make parts of the body 
areas visible to doctors during tests to help them see if the cancer has spread to places called  lymph nodes<br />
that are found near tumours. The lymph nodes nearest the tumour are called  sentinel  lymph nodes. These 
lymph nodes are where cancer cells are most likely to have spread.  When Lymphoseek has found the 
sentinel lymph nodes, they can be removed and checked to see if there are any cancer cells present.<br />
Lymphoseek finds the lymph nodes and can be detected using a special camera or detector.  </p>
<p>The use of Lymphoseek does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure 
with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation.   </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Lymphoseek: </p>
<p>if you have experienced any signs of allergic reaction (listed in section 4) after previous admistration 
of Lymphoseek 
  if you have kidney or liver problems (renal or heptatic disease) </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been studied 
in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lymphoseek 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of Lymphoseek if there is a 
possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period, or if you are breast-feeding. <br />
When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, the nuclear medicine doctor will only administer this product during pregnancy if a 
benefit is expected which would outweigh the risks.  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, breast milk should be discarded for 24 hours after administration of Lymphoseek. 
Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Lymphoseek will affect your ability to drive or to use machines.  Your  doctor 
and nuclear medicine doctor will tell you when it is safe to drive after your surgery. </p>
<p>Lymphoseek contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. That means it is essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products.  Lymphoseek will 
only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by people who 
are trained to use it safely. These people will take special care for the safe use of this product and will keep 
you informed of their actions.  </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide the quantity of Lymphoseek to be used in 
your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information.  </p>
<p>The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 18.5 to 74 MBq 
(megabecquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity).  </p>
<p>The dose may be divided up into smaller amounts.  This means that the doctor can make more than one 
injection in the area around the tumour. </p>
<p>Before administration of Lymphoseek you should:<br />
Follow the instructions of your doctor or nuclear medicine doctor. </p>
<p>Administration of Lymphoseek and conduct of the procedure<br />
Lymphoseek is injected under the skin, under the nipple, or in or around the tumour.  The place depends on 
the type of tumour. </p>
<p>Lymphoseek is given either the day before or on the day of your procedure. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure.  </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor uses a special camera to find Lymphoseek.  The surgeon uses the pictures taken 
to see where the sentinel lymph nodes are located.  The surgeon will also use a machine that finds the 99mTc 
part of the medicine.  The 99mTc shows the surgeon where the sentinel lymph nodes are located.   </p>
<p>When the sentinel lymph node is found, the surgeon removes it.  If there is more than one sentinel lymph 
node, they will remove these nodes as well.  The sentinel lymph nodes are then checked to see if cancer cells 
have spread to them.   </p>
<p>What to do after adminstration of Lymphoseek<br />
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving this 
medicine.  Contact your doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more Lymphoseek than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because you will get a specially measured amount of Lymphoseek precisely 
controlled by the doctor supervising the procedure.  However, in the case of an overdose, you will receive 
the appropriate treatment.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the nuclear medicine doctor who 
supervises the procedure.  </p>         </div>"""
