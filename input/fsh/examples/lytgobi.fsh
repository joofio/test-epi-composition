tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It blocks the action of a protein in the cell, called fibroblast growth factor 
receptor (FGFR), that helps regulate cell growth. Cancer cells may have an abnormal form of this 
protein. By blocking FGFR, futibatinib can prevent the growth of such cancer cells. </p>
<p>Lytgobi is used on its own (monotherapy)to treat adults with bile duct cancer (also known as 
cholangiocarcinoma) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery in patients who have already 
received previous treatment, and whose tumour has a certain type of abnormal  FGFR . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lytgobi if you have: 
* been told you have high levels of phosphate in your blood (a condition known as 
hyperphosphataemia) based on a blood test result 
* vision or eye problems such as problems with the retina (light-sensitive layers of nerve tissue at 
the back of the eye) </p>
<p>Eye examinations are recommended: 
* before starting treatment with Lytgobi 
* 6 weeks thereafter or at any time if any visual or eye problems occur.  </p>
<p>Lytgobi can cause serous retinal detachment (retina pulls away from its normal position). Symptoms 
include blurred vision, flashes of light in the field of vision (photopsia) and small dark shapes moving 
in the field of vision (floaters). Tell your doctor straight away if you get any problems with your 
vision. </p>
<p>Lytgobi can cause high levels of phosphate in your blood and may lead to a build-up of minerals such 
as calcium in different tissues in your body. Your doctor may prescribe changes in your diet, 
phosphate lowering therapy, or change or stop treatment with Lytgobi if needed. Tell your doctor 
straight away if you develop painful skin lesions, any muscle cramps, numbness or tingling around 
your mouth, or an abnormal heartbeat.    </p>
<p>Lytgobi may harm the unborn baby. If you are a woman of childbearing age or your partner is of 
childbearing capacity, you must use an effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after 
the last dose of Lytgobi. Because it is not known if Lytgobi decreases the effectiveness of birth 
control medication, barrier methods should be applied in addition to such medication to avoid 
pregnancy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Lytgobi should not be given to children or adolescents under 18 years. It is not known whether it is 
safe and effective in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lytgobi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines so that the 
doctor can decide if your treatment needs to change: 
* itraconazole: a medicine to treat fungal infections<br />
<em> clarithromycin: medicines to treat certain infections 
* rifampicin: a medicine to treat tuberculosis or certain other infections<br />
</em> carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital: medicines to treat epilepsy<br />
<em> efavirenz: medicine to treat HIV infection<br />
</em> digoxin: a medicine to treat heart disease<br />
<em> dabigatran: a medicine to prevent blood clots<br />
</em> colchicine: a medicine to treat gout attacks 
* rosuvastatin: a medicine to treat high cholesterol<br />
* theophylline: a medicine to treat breathing problems 
* olanzapine: a medicine to manage symptoms of mental health conditions </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy /Contraception -information for women 
You should not become pregnant during the treatment with Lytgobi because this medicine could 
harm your baby. A pregnancy test should be performed before initiating treatment, and women 
who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week 
after the last dose of Lytgobi. Barrier methods should be applied as a second form of 
contraception to avoid pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for 
you. </li>
<li>Contraception -information for men<br />
You should not conceive a child during treatment with Lytgobi because this medicine may harm 
the baby. You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose 
of Lytgobi.  </li>
<li>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Lytgobi and for 1 week after the last dose. This is </li>
</ul>
<p>because it is not known if Lytgobi can pass into breast milk and could therefore harm your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Lytgobi can cause side effects such as fatigue or visual disturbances. Do not drive or operate 
machinery if this happens. </p>
<p>Lytgobi contains lactose and sodium 
This medicine contains lactose (found in milk or dairy products). If you have been told by your doctor 
that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
