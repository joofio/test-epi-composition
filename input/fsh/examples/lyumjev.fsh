Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. It 
is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other medicines containing insulin lispro. Lyumjev 
contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin lispro into the body. </p>
<p>Diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin 
effectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin 
medicine that is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of 
diabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. </p>
<p>Treatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from 
your diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up 
to 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal. </p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not 
change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  </p>         </div>"""

should ). 
* if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in

Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. </p>
<p>If you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. </p>
<ul>
<li>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).<br />
Low blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.<br />
Lyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia 
occurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia 
or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar 
levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may 
not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later 
in this leaflet. For symptoms please see  Common problems of diabetes . </li>
</ul>
<p>You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. 
You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. 
Making changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.<br />
It may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood 
sugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicines.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia). <br />
Stopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see  Common 
problems of diabetes . </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using an insulin pump and it stops working you will need to fix the problem 
immediately as this can lead to high blood sugar. You may need to take an injection of Lyumjev 
using an insulin pen or a syringe if your pump stops working. </p>
</li>
<li>If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicines called 
thiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you 
get signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). </li>
<li>If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using 
this medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. </li>
<li>Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. </li>
<li>Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you 
can then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see  reporting of side 
effects . </li>
<li>
<p>Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a 
needle is blocked replace it with a new needle. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site. 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Lyumjev). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lyumjev 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change. </p>
<p>Your blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   </p>
<ul>
<li>other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  </li>
<li>sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) </li>
<li>acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) </li>
<li>some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) </li>
<li>some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for 
some heart problems or high blood pressure) </li>
<li>angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) </li>
<li>somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving 
too much growth hormone) </li>
</ul>
<p>Your blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: </p>
<ul>
<li>danazol (for endometriosis) </li>
<li>the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) </li>
<li>thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) </li>
<li>human growth hormone  (for growth hormone deficiency) </li>
<li>diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  </li>
<li>sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  </li>
<li>corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) </li>
</ul>
<p>Beta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the 
warning signs of low blood sugar.  </p>
<p>Lyumjev with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you 
need usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. 
After you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed 
before your pregnancy.  </p>
<p>There are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, 
you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: 
* frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
* reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia </p>
<p>Lyumjev contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

told you. Check with them if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>They will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will 
also tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  </p>
<p>You should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. </p>
<p>If you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to make your injections.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject 
them separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. </p>
<p>When to inject Lyumjev 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two 
before the meal; you also have the option to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  </p>
<p>How much insulin to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain<br />
<em> How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. 
* How and when to check your blood sugar level.<br />
</em> How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
* What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are 
using other medicines. 
* If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This 
might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  </p>
<p>Do not use Lyumjev 
* If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
* If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5  How to store Lyumjev ). 
* If the plastic cap of the vial is damaged, do not use.  </p>
<p>Where to inject Lyumjev 
* Inject Lyumjev under the skin (subcutaneous injection). 
* Do not inject yourself directly into a vein. Only your physician can administer Lyumjev by the 
intravenous use. He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are 
ill and your sugar levels are too high. 
* Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you  rotate  the places you 
inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen), as you have been taught.<br />
* If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. </p>
<p>How to inject Lyumjev from a vial 
* First wash your hands. 
* Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber 
stopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. 
* Use a new, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of 
Lyumjev you want. Your doctor, nurse or clinic will tell you how to do this. Do not share your 
needles and syringes. 
* Inject under the skin, as you were taught. After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 
seconds to make sure you receive the full dose.   </p>
<p>Using Lyumjev in an insulin pump<br />
<em> Only certain insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse Lyumjev.<br />
</em> Carefully follow the instructions supplied with your infusion pump. 
* Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. It is important to use the correct 
needle length on the filling system to avoid damaging the pump. 
* Change the infusion set (tubing and needle) according to the instructions supplied with the 
infusion set.<br />
<em> If repeated or severe low blood sugar levels occur, tell your doctor or nurse. 
* A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in sugar levels. 
If you think Lyumjev is not flowing, follow the pump instructions and if appropriate, notify 
your doctor or nurse.<br />
</em> You may need to take an injection of Lyumjev if your pump does not work properly. </p>
<p>After injecting 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before deciding if 
you need another injection. </p>
<p>If you use more Lyumjev than you should 
If you inject too much Lyumjev, or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may 
occur. Check your blood sugar. </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or 
drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you 
and have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check 
your blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. </p>
<p>If you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, 
have difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. 
This can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If 
glucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to 
tell you about glucagon. </p>
<p>Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. </p>
<p>Let them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical 
help straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Lyumjev 
If you forget to use your insulin or you use less than you should, or are unsure how much you have 
injected, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide 
if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your usual dosing schedule at your next meal. </p>
<p>If you stop using Lyumjev 
Do not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you use less Lyumjev than you 
should, a high blood sugar may occur. </p>
<p>If high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 ).  </p>
<p>Three simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
* Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Lyumjev. 
* Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
* Always carry sugar with you. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 
under  If you use more Lyumjev than you should . </p>
<p>Allergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may

<p>rash over the whole body<br />
  difficulty in breathing<br />
  wheezing 
  blood pressure dropping<br />
  heart beating fast<br />
  sweating </p>
<p>If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the

<p>Very common 
Infusion site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the

<p>Common<br />
Injection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop 
Lyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
the build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very well 
if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin 
changes. </p>
<p>Other potential side effects 
Swelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema), particularly at the start of insulin therapy 
or during a change in your diabetes medicines. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Common problems of diabetes </p>
<p>Low blood sugar<br />
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
* you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; 
* you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
* you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
* you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
* there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble 
with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
See section  If you use more Lyumjev than you should.  </p>
<p>The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
* tiredness 
* rapid heart beat 
* nervousness or shakiness 
* feeling sick 
* headache 
* cold sweat </p>
<p>If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too 
high. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
* not taking your insulin; 
* using less insulin than your body needs; <br />
* an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or 
* fever, infection or emotional stress. </p>
<p>The early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;<br />
<em> being very thirsty<br />
</em> headache<br />
* feeling sleepy 
* urinating more often </p>
<p>Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: 
* nausea and/or vomiting 
* abdominal pain 
* rapid pulse 
* heavy breathing 
* moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for 
energy instead of glucose. </p>
<p>If you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. 
See section  If you forget to use Lyumjev . </p>
<p>Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
 sick rules , and tell your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
