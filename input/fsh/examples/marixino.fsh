message signals in the brain. The brain contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors 
that are involved in transmitting nerve signals important in learning and memory. Marixino belongs to 
a group of medicines called NMDA-receptor antagonists. Marixino acts on these NMDA-receptors 
improving the transmission of nerve signals and the memory.

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Marixino:
-
if you have a history of epileptic seizures
-
if you have recently experienced a myocardial infarction (heart attack), or if you are suffering 
from congestive heart failure or from an uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure).
In these situations the treatment should be carefully supervised, and the clinical benefit of Marixino 
reassessed by your doctor on a regular basis.
If you suffer from renal impairment (kidney problems), your doctor should closely monitor your 
kidney function and if necessary adapt the memantine doses accordingly.
The use of medicinal products called amantadine (for the treatment of Parkinson s disease), ketamine 
(a substance generally used as an anaesthetic), dextromethorphan (generally used to treat cough) and 
other NMDA-antagonists at the same time should be avoided.
Children and adolescents
Marixino is not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
Other medicines and Marixino
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
In particular, Marixino may change the effects of the following medicines and their dose may need to 
be adjusted by your doctor:
-
amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan
-
dantrolene, baclofen
-
cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, nicotine
-
hydrochlorothiazide (or any combination with hydrochlorothiazide)
-
anticholinergics (substances generally used to treat movement disorders or intestinal cramps)
-
anticonvulsants (substances used to prevent and relieve seizures)
-
barbiturates (substances generally used to induce sleep)
-
dopaminergic agonists (substances such as L-dopa, bromocriptine)

-
oral anticoagulants
If you go into hospital, let your doctor know that you are taking Marixino.
Marixino with food and drink
You should inform your doctor if you have recently changed or intend to change your diet 
substantially (e.g. from normal diet to strict vegetarian diet) or if you are suffering from states of renal 
tubulary acidosis (RTA, an excess of acid-forming substances in the blood due to renal dysfunction 
(poor kidney function)) or severe infections of the urinary tract (structure that carries urine), as your 
doctor may need to adjust the dose of your medicine.

your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
