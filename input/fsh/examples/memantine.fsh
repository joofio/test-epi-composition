Memantine LEK contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. 
Memantine LEK belongs to a group of medicines known as anti-dementia medicines. 
Memory loss in Alzheimer s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve signals 
important in learning and memory. Memantine LEK belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-receptor 
antagonists. Memantine LEK acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the transmission of nerve signals 
and the memory. </p>
<p>What is Memantine LEK used for 
Memantine LEK is used for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer s disease. </p>         </div>"""
