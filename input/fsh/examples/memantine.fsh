Memantine Merz contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. 
Memantine Merz belongs to a group of medicines known as anti-dementia medicines. 
Memory loss in Alzheimer s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve 
signals important in learning and memory. Memantine Merz belongs to a group of medicines called 
NMDA-receptor antagonists. Memantine Merz acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the 
transmission of nerve signals and the memory. </p>
<p>What is Memantine Merz used for 
Memantine Merz is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer s disease. </p>         </div>"""
