Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue will be given to you or your child (0-17 years old) to treat 
problems with your blood resulting from exposure to some medicines or chemicals that can cause a 
disease called methaemoglobinaemia. 
In methaemoglobinaemia, your blood contains too much methaemoglobin (an abnormal form of 
haemoglobin that is not able to transport oxygen around your body effectively). This medicine will 
help your haemoglobin return to normal and restore the transport of oxygen in the blood. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to methylthioninium chloride or other thiazine dyes 
- if your body does not produce enough of the enzyme G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase)<br />
-<br />
if your body does not produce enough of the enzyme NADPH (nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate) reductase 
- if your blood disorder has been caused by nitrite during treatment of cyanide poisoning 
- if your blood disorder has been caused by chlorate poisoning. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue 
- if you have moderate or severe renal disease; lower single dose (1 to 2 mg/kg maximum) is 
needed<br />
- if your blood disorder has been caused by a chemical called aniline, which is contained in dyes; 
lower doses may be needed and total cumulative dose should not exceed 4 mg/kg (see section 3 
of this package leaflet) 
- if your blood disorder has been caused by a medicine called dapsone (used to treat leprosy and 
other skin conditions); lower doses may be needed and total cumulative dose should not exceed 
4 mg/kg (see section 3) </p>
<ul>
<li>if you suffer from hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus, as these conditions may be worsened by 
the glucose solution used for the dilution of the medicine </li>
<li>your urine and stools may turn a blue-green colour; and skin may possibly turn a blue colour 
when you are treated with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue. This discolouration is 
expected and will disappear after the treatment has ended<br />
If any of the above applies to you, please consult your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Photosensitivity 
Methylthioninium chloride may cause a photosensitivity reaction in the skin (sunburn-like reaction) 
when exposed to strong light sources, such as light therapy, lights in operating rooms and pulse 
oximeters. 
Protective measures against exposure to light should be taken. </p>
<p>Monitoring tests 
You will undergo monitoring tests during and after treatment with Methylthioninium chloride 
Proveblue. </p>
<p>Children 
Special care must be taken with Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue:</p>
<ul>
<li>in newborns and infants 3 months old or younger, lower doses are recommended (see section 3 
of this package leaflet). </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.<br />
You should not be given methylthioninium chloride at the same time you are taking certain medicines 
to treat depression or anxiety which affect a brain chemical called serotonin. When used in 
combination with these medicines methylthioninium chloride may cause serotonin syndrome, which 
can be potentially life-threatening. Such medicines include: 
* Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and zimelidine 
* bupropion 
* buspirone 
* clomipramine 
* mirtazapine<br />
<em> venlafaxine<br />
</em> Monoamine oxidase inhibitors </p>
<p>Opioids, for example, tramadol, fentanyl, pethidine, and dextromethorphan, may also increase the risk 
of developing serotonin syndrome, when used in combination with methylthioninium chloride. 
However, if the intravenous use of methylthioninium chloride cannot be avoided, you should be 
administered the lowest possible dose and observed closely for up to 4 hours after administration. 
If you have any doubts about whether this medicine should be given to you, consult your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
The use of Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue during pregnancy is not recommended unless it is 
clearly necessary, for example in a life-threatening situation. 
Due to a lack of available data on whether methylthioninium chloride passes into human breast milk, 
breast-feeding should be discontinued for up to 8 days after treatment with this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines as methylthioninium chloride has moderate influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Adults, children above 3 months and elderly 
The usual dose is 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of your body weight, i.e. 0.2 to 0.4 ml per kilogram given 
over a period of 5 minutes. A second dose may be given after one hour if required.<br />
The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 7 mg/kg.<br />
If your blood disorder has been caused by aniline or dapsone, total cumulative dose should not exceed 
4 mg/kg (see section 2). 
Usually, treatment should not exceed one day. 
Renal Impairment 
In infants above 3 months, children and adolescents and in adults, the recommended dosage in patient 
with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1-2 mg/kg per body weight. If a 
1 mg/kg dose is given, a repeat dose of 1 mg/kg may be given one hour after the first dose in cases of 
persistent or recurrent symptoms or if methaemoglobin levels remain significantly higher than the 
normal clinical range. The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 
2 mg/kg. </p>
<p>In infants above 3 months, children and adolescents and in adults, the recommended dosage in patient 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) is a single dose of 1 mg/kg per body 
weight. The maximum recommended cumulative dose for the course of treatment is 1 mg/kg. </p>
<p>Methylthioninium chloride should be used with caution in infants 3 months old or younger and 
newborn infants with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) since there 
is no data available and methylthioninium chloride is predominantly renally eliminated. Lower 
maximum cumulative doses (&lt;0.5 mg/kg body weight) may be considered. </p>
<p>No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.m2). </p>
<p>Infants 3 months old or younger<br />
The recommended dose is 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06 to 0.1 ml/kg, over a period of 
5 minutes.<br />
A repeat dose (0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.e. 0.06-0.1 ml/kg) may be given after one hour in case 
of persistence or recurrence of symptoms. Usually, treatment should not exceed one day. 
This medicine may be diluted in 50 ml glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection to avoid local 
pain, in particular in children. </p>
