<p>MIRCERA is indicated to treat only the symptomatic anaemia caused by chronic kidney disease in

stimulating agent (ESA) maintenance treatment after their haemoglobin level was stabilised with the

* if you are allergic to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or to any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
* if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
The safety and efficacy of MIRCERA therapy in other indications, including anaemia in patients with 
cancer, has not been established. </p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of MIRCERA therapy in paediatric patients have only been established in 
patients whose haemoglobin level has been previously stabilised by treatment with an ESA.  </p>
<p>Before treatment with MIRCERA 
* A condition called Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA, stopped or reduced production of red blood 
cells) due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies was observed in some patients treated with 
erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), including MIRCERA. 
* If your doctor suspects or confirms that you have these antibodies in your blood, you must not 
be treated with MIRCERA. 
* If you are a patient with hepatitis C and you receive interferon and ribavirin you should discuss<br />
this with your doctor because a combination of ESAs with interferon and ribavirin has led to a 
loss of effect and development of PRCA, a severe form of anemia, in rare cases. ESAs are not 
approved in the management of anaemia associated with hepatitis C. 
* If you are a patient with chronic kidney disease and anemia treated with an ESA and are also 
a cancer patient you should be aware that ESAs, might have a negative impact on your 
condition. You should discuss options for anemia treatment with your doctor. 
* It is not known if MIRCERA has a different effect in patients with haemoglobinopathies 
(disorders associated with abnormal haemoglobin), past or present bleeding, seizures or with a 
high blood platelet count. If you have any of these conditions, your doctor will discuss it with 
you and must treat you with caution. 
* Healthy people should not use MIRCERA. Using it can lead to too high haemoglobin levels and 
cause problems with the heart or blood vessels that may be life-threatening. </p>
<p>During treatment with MIRCERA 
* If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to 
MIRCERA, your doctor will check your dose of MIRCERA because repeatedly increasing your 
dose of MIRCERA if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a 
problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke 
and death.<br />
<em> Your doctor may initiate treatment with MIRCERA if your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl 
(6.21 mmol/l) or less. After initiation of therapy, your doctor will seek to maintain your 
haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). 
* Your doctor will check the amount of iron in your blood before and during MIRCERA 
treatment. If the amount is too low your doctor may give you an additional iron supplement. 
* Your doctor will check your blood pressure before and during your MIRCERA treatment. If 
your blood pressure is high and cannot be controlled, either by appropriate medicines or a 
special diet, your doctor will interrupt your MIRCERA treatment or reduce the dose. 
* Your doctor will check that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high 
haemoglobin could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and 
could increase risk of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke 
and death.<br />
</em> Contact your doctor if you feel tired, weak or have shortness of breath, because this could mean 
that your MIRCERA treatment is not effective. Your doctor will check that you do not have 
other causes of anaemia and may perform blood tests or examine your bone marrow. If you 
have developed PRCA, your MIRCERA treatment will be discontinued. You will not receive 
another ESA and your doctor will treat you for this condition. 
Children and adolescents 
MIRCERA can be used for the treatment of children and adolescents, 3 months of age to less than years, with anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease. They should be stabilised on ESA 
maintenance treatment prior to switching to MIRCERA and may or may not be receiving dialysis. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are 
under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: MIRCERA is one 
of a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein 
erythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional will always record the exact product you are using. </p>
<p>Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. 
SJS/TEN can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters 
on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. 
These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may 
progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications. </p>
<p>If you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms stop taking Mircera and contact your 
doctor or seek medical attention immediately. </p>
<p>Other medicines and MIRCERA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
No interaction studies have been performed. There is no evidence that MIRCERA interacts with other 
medicines. </p>
<p>MIRCERA with food and drink 
Food and drink do not affect MIRCERA. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
MIRCERA has not been studied in pregnant or breast-feeding women. 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor 
will consider what is the best treatment for you during pregnancy. 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed. Your doctor will advise if you 
should stop or continue breast-feeding and stop or continue your treatment. 
MIRCERA has not shown evidence of impaired fertility in animals. The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
MIRCERA does not affect your ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of MIRCERA 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say it is essentially

<p>Your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. </p>
<p>If you do not respond adequately to MIRCERA, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you 
if you need to change doses of MIRCERA. 
Treatment with MIRCERA must be started under the supervision of a healthcare professional. 
Further injections can be given by a healthcare professional or, after you have been trained, as an 
adult, you can inject MIRCERA yourself. Children and adolescents less than 18 years should not self-
inject MIRCERA, the administration should be performed by a healthcare professional or trained adult 
caregiver (follow the instructions at the end of this leaflet on how to use MIRCERA pre-filled syringe 
to give to yourself or another individual an injection.) </p>
<p>MIRCERA can be injected under the skin in the abdomen, arm or thigh; or into a vein. Your doctor 
will decide which is best for you. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to monitor how your anaemia is responding to treatment 
by measuring your haemoglobin level. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are an adult not currently treated with an ESA 
If you are not on dialysis, the recommended starting dose of MIRCERA is 1.2 micrograms for every 
kilogram of your body weight to be administered under the skin once every month as a single 
injection. Alternatively, your doctor may decide to administer a starting dose of MIRCERA of 
0.6 micrograms for every kilogram of your body weight. The dose is to be administered once every 
two weeks as a single injection under the skin or into a vein. Once your anaemia is corrected your 
doctor may change your dosing to once a month administration. 
If you are on dialysis, the recommended starting dose is 0.6 micrograms for every kilogram of your

<p>Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose or temporarily stop your treatment to adjust your 
haemoglobin level, as appropriate for you. Dose changes will not be made more often than once a 
month. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are currently being treated with another ESA 
Your doctor may replace your current medicine with MIRCERA. Your doctor will decide to treat you 
with MIRCERA administered as a single injection once a month. Your doctor will calculate your 
MIRCERA starting dose based on the last dose of your previous medicine. The first MIRCERA dose 
will be given on the planned injection day of your previous medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose or temporarily stop your treatment to adjust your 
haemoglobin to an appropriate level for you. Dose changes will not be made more often than once a 
month. </p>
<p>If you use more MIRCERA than you should 
Please contact your doctor or pharmacist if you used too large a dose of MIRCERA as it may be 
necessary to perform some blood tests and interrupt your treatment. </p>
<p>If you forget to use MIRCERA 
If you miss a dose of MIRCERA administer the missed dose as soon as you remember and talk to your 
doctor about when to use the next doses.  </p>
<p>If you stop using MIRCERA 
Treatment with MIRCERA is normally long-term. It can, however, be stopped on the advice of your 
doctor at any time. </p>
