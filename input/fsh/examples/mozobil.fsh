cells. This protein  ties  blood stem cells to the bone marrow. Plerixafor improves the release of stem 
cells into the blood stream (mobilisation). The stem cells can then be collected by a machine that 
separates blood constituents (apheresis machine), and subsequently frozen and stored until your 
transplant. </p>
<p>If mobilisation is poor, Mozobil is used to help collect blood stem cells from the patient, for collection, 
storage and reintroduction (transplantation), 
* In adults who have lymphoma (a cancer of the white blood cells) or multiple myeloma (a cancer 
that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow).

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before using Mozobil.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor:<br />
<em> if you have or have had any heart problems. 
* if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may adjust the dose. 
* if you have high white blood cell counts.<br />
</em> if you have low platelet counts. 
* if you have a history of feeling faint or lightheaded on standing or sitting or have fainted before 
upon injections. </p>
<p>Your doctor may perform regular blood tests to monitor your blood cell count. </p>
<p>It is not recommended to use Mozobil for stem cell mobilisation if you have leukaemia (a cancer of 
the blood or bone marrow). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Mozobil 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
You should not use Mozobil if you are pregnant, since there is no experience with Mozobil in pregnant 
women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are, think you may be or are planning to become 
pregnant. It is recommended to use contraception if you are of child-bearing age.  </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed if you are using Mozobil, since it is not known if Mozobil is excreted in 
human milk.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Mozobil may cause dizziness and fatigue. Therefore, you should avoid driving if you feel dizzy, tired 
or unwell. </p>
<p>Mozobil contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>You will first receive G-CSF, then you will be given Mozobil 
Mobilisation will be started by first giving you another medicine called G-CSF (granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor). G-CSF will help Mozobil to work properly in your body. If you want to know 
more about G-CSF ask your doctor and read the corresponding package leaflet. </p>
<p>How much Mozobil is given? 
The recommended adult dose is either a 20 mg (fixed dose) or 0.24 mg/kg body weight/day.<br />
The recommended dose for children, 1 to less than 18 years of age is 0.24 mg/kg of body weight/day.  </p>
<p>Your dose will depend on your body weight, which should be measured the week before you receive 
your first dose. If you have moderate or severe kidney problems, your doctor will reduce the dose.  </p>
<p>How is Mozobil given? 
Mozobil is given by subcutaneous injection (under your skin). </p>
<p>When is Mozobil given for the first time? 
You will receive your first dose 6 to 11 hours before apheresis (collection of your blood stem cells). </p>
<p>How long will Mozobil be given? 
Treatment lasts 2 to 4 consecutive days (in some cases up to 7 days), until enough stem cells have 
been collected for your transplant. In a few cases, enough stem cells may not be collected, and the 
collection attempt will be stopped. </p>         </div>"""

being given Mozobil and G-CSF. Please inform your doctor immediately if you experience chest 
discomfort. </p>
<p>Pins and needles and numbness 
Pins and needles and numbness are common in patients being treated for cancers. About one in five 
patients suffered from these feelings. However, these effects do not seem to occur more frequently 
when you use Mozobil. 
You may also have an increase in white blood cells count (leucocytosis), in your blood tests. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects

listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this
