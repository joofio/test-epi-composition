natural substance that controls the release of human growth hormone. Octreotide works in the same 
way as somatostatin, but its action lasts longer so it does not need to be taken so often. </p>
<p>Mycapssa is used for maintenance treatment in adults with acromegaly, a condition wherein the body 
produces too much growth hormone. It is used in patients in whom medicines like somatostatin have 
already been shown to be of benefit. </p>
<p>Normally, growth hormone regulates the growth of tissues, organs and bones. In acromegaly, 
increased production of growth hormone (usually from a non-cancerous tumour in the pituitary gland) 
leads to enlargement of bones and certain tissues, and symptoms such as headache, excessive 
sweating, numbness in the hands and feet, tiredness and joint pain. Treatment with Mycapssa can help 
relieve the symptoms.  </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to octreotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Mycapssa or during treatment if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>heart or blood circulation problems, since the medicine can affect the rate and regularity of 
your heartbeat. </li>
<li>gallbladder problems. Octreotide can cause gallstones to form, and your doctor will 
recommend ultrasound scans to check for this, usually every 6 to 12 months while you are being 
treated with this medicine. </li>
<li>diabetes, since Mycapssa may affect your blood sugar. Persistent increased blood sugar levels 
may occur during long-term use. Low blood sugar levels have also been reported. Therefore, 
your doctor may recommend monitoring blood sugar levels and treatment of diabetes. 
If you have type I diabetes and you are being treated with insulin, your doses may need to be 
reduced during treatment with Mycapssa. </li>
<li>ever had lack of vitamin B12. If you have a history of lacking vitamin B12, your doctor may 
wish to check your vitamin B12 level periodically during treatment with Mycapssa since this 
medicine can decrease vitamin B12 levels in the blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring during treatment 
Tumours of the pituitary gland that produce excess growth hormone and lead to acromegaly 
sometimes expand, causing serious complications such as visual problems. It is essential that you are 
monitored for tumour growth while taking Mycapssa. If evidence of tumour expansion appears, your 
doctor may prescribe a different treatment. </p>
<p>Your doctor will regularly check your liver function during treatment and will also check your thyroid 
function when treatment with Mycapssa is prolonged. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Mycapssa is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years because it is not known if it 
is safe or effective in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Mycapssa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines as they may change how Mycapssa works:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines which control or reduce stomach acid </li>
<li>metoclopramide: a medicine to treat nausea and vomiting </li>
<li>loperamide: a medicine to treat diarrhoea </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines, which may be affected when 
used with Mycapssa. If you take these medicines, your doctor may need to adjust the doses of these 
medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines called beta blockers, used to treat high blood pressure, heart disease or other illnesses </li>
<li>medicines called calcium channel blockers, used to treat high blood pressure or heart diseases  </li>
<li>hydrochlorothiazide: a medicine to treat high blood pressure and tissue swelling caused by 
excess fluid </li>
<li>quinidine: a medicine to treat irregular heart rhythm </li>
<li>lisinopril: a medicine to treat high blood pressure and other heart and specific kidney diseases </li>
<li>digoxin: a medicine to treat heart weakness and irregular heartbeat </li>
<li>medicines to treat fluid and electrolyte balance </li>
<li>insulin or other medicines to treat diabetes </li>
<li>ciclosporin: a medicine to suppress transplant rejection, treat severe skin diseases, severe eye 
and joint inflammation </li>
<li>bromocriptine: a medicine to treat Parkinson s and other diseases (e.g. pituitary tumours) and to 
aid weaning </li>
<li>oral contraceptives, such as birth control pills: a medicine to prevent pregnancy or to treat 
intensive menstrual bleeding 
Mycapssa may reduce the effectiveness of oral hormonal contraceptives containing 
progestogens. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Avoid taking Mycapssa during pregnancy and breast-feeding. This is a precaution, as there is limited 
information on the use of Mycapssa during pregnancy and breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Women who can get pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment with Mycapssa. 
Discuss appropriate methods with your doctor as Mycapssa may reduce the effectiveness of oral 
contraceptives containing progestogens. If you are using such contraceptives, you are therefore 
advised to use other non-hormonal methods of contraception or add a back-up method while taking 
Mycapssa. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Mycapssa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, avoid 
driving or using machines if your ability to react is reduced due to side effects such as dizziness, 
weakness/fatigue or headache. </p>
<p>Mycapssa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended starting dose is 1 capsule twice daily. </p>
<p>The doctor will gradually increase the dose in steps of 1 capsule daily to adequately control your 
disease, up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 4 capsules. Your doctor will check your 
symptoms and the levels of a substance called insulin-like growth factor every 2 weeks or so after each 
increase, to check how your body is responding to the new dose and find the right dose for you.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will check your symptoms less frequently once you are on a regular daily dose. During 
these checks your doctor will make sure that the medicine is still working well for you. </p>
<p>Method of use 
Always take this medicine as instructed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole with a glass of 
water, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating any food. It is recommended to have a routine 
schedule for taking Mycapssa in relation to food every day (for example, take Mycapssa routinely at 
least 1 hour before breakfast and at least 2 hours after dinner). </p>
<p>How to remove a capsule from blister:<br />
Press GENTLY on top or bottom of capsule. </p>
<p>DO NOT press the middle of the capsule. This could damage it. 
If a capsule is cracked or broken, throw it away (discard it) and remove another capsule. </p>
<p>If you take more Mycapssa than you should 
If you have accidentally taken more Mycapssa than you should, stop taking this medicine and tell your 
doctor straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Mycapssa 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Administer one dose as soon as you 
remember, as long as it is taken at least 6 hours before the next scheduled dose. Otherwise, skip the 
missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Mycapssa 
Do not stop taking this medicine without discussing with your doctor first. If you stop taking 
Mycapssa, your acromegaly symptoms may come back. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
