certain cancer cells.  </p>
<p>MYLOTARG is used to treat a certain type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in which 
the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells. MYLOTARG is intended for the treatment of AML for 
patients aged 15 years and above who have not tried other treatments. MYLOTARG is not for use in patients

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
When you first receive this medicine and during the course of treatment, tell your doctor or nurse if you: 
  have or ever had liver problems: MYLOTARG may cause, during or after treatment, a potentially 
life-threatening condition called hepatic venoocclusive disease, in which the blood vessels in the liver 
become damaged and obstructed by blood clots which may lead to fluid retention, rapid weight gain, 
increased liver size (which may be painful), and ascites (excessive accumulation of fluid in the 
abdominal cavity). <br />
  allergic reaction: experience a high-pitched whistling sound during breathing (wheezing), difficult 
breathing, shortness of breath or cough with or without mucous, hives, itching, swelling, or feeling 
fever and chills (signs of an infusion related reaction) during or shortly after the MYLOTARG 
infusion. 
  infection: have or think you have, an infection, develop chills or shivering, or feel warm, or have 
fever. Some infections may be serious and may be life-threatening.

regular basis. </p>
<p>anaemia: have headaches, feel tired, experience dizziness, or look pale . </p>
<p>infusion reaction: experience during or shortly after MYLOTARG infusion symptoms such as 
dizziness, decreased urination, confusion, vomiting, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath, or heart 
rhythm disturbances (this may be a potentially life-threatening complication known as tumour lysis 
syndrome).  </p>
