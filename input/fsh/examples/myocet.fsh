<li>PRESENTATION </li>
</ol>
<p>Myocet liposomal is supplied as a three-vial system: (1) doxorubicin HCl, (2) liposomes, and 
(3) buffer. In addition to these three components, 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution for injection 
will also be required for the reconstitution of the doxorubicin HCl. Myocet liposomal must be 
reconstituted prior to administration.  </p>
<ol>
<li>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFE HANDLING </li>
</ol>
<p>The normal procedures for proper handling and disposal of anti-tumour medicinal products should be 
adopted, namely: </p>
<ul>
<li>Personnel should be trained to reconstitute the medicinal product. </li>
<li>Pregnant staff should be excluded from handling the medicinal product. </li>
<li>Personnel handling this medicinal product during reconstitution should wear protective 
clothing including masks, goggles and gloves. </li>
<li>All items for administration or cleaning, including gloves, should be placed in a high-risk, 
waste disposal bag for high-temperature incineration. Liquid waste may be flushed with large 
amounts of water. </li>
<li>
<p>Accidental contact with the skin or eyes should be treated immediately with copious amounts 
of water. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout handling of Myocet liposomal since no 
preservative is present. </p>
<p>3.1 
Preparation of Myocet liposomal </p>
<p>Step 1.  Set up 
Two alternative heating methods can be used : a Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater or a water bath: 
* Turn on the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater and set the controller to 75 C-76 C.  Verify the 
temperature set point by checking the thermometer(s) on each heat block insert. <br />
* If using a water bath, turn on the water bath and allow it to equilibrate at 58 C (55 C-60 C).<br />
Verify the temperature set point by checking the thermometer.   </p>
<p>(Please note that whilst the control settings on the water bath and heat block are set to different levels 
the temperature of the vial contents are in the same range (55 C-60 C)). </p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the carton of constituents from the refrigerator. </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2.  Reconstitute doxorubicin HCl 
* Withdraw 20 ml sodium chloride solution for injection (0.9%), (not provided in the package), 
and inject into each vial of doxorubicin HCl, intended for preparation.<br />
* Shake well in the inverted position to ensure doxorubicin is fully dissolved. </p>
<p>Step 3.  Heat in water bath or dry heat block 
* Heat the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial in the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater with the 
thermometer in the block reading (75 C-76 C) for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). <br />
* If using a water bath, heat the doxorubicin HCl vial with the thermometer temperature reading 
55 C-60 C for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). 
* While heating proceed to step 4. Step 4.  Adjust pH of liposomes 
* Withdraw 1.9 ml of liposomes. Inject into the buffer vial to adjust the pH of liposomes.<br />
Pressure build-up may require venting. 
* Shake well. </p>
<p>Step 5.  Add pH-adjusted liposomes to doxorubicin 
* Using a syringe, withdraw the entire vial contents of pH-adjusted liposomes from the buffer 
vial. 
* Remove the reconstituted doxorubicin HCl vial from the water bath or dry heat block.<br />
SHAKE VIGOROUSLY. Carefully insert a pressure-venting device equipped with a 
hydrophobic filter. Then IMMEDIATELY (within 2 minutes) inject the pH-adjusted 
liposomes into the vial of heated reconstituted doxorubicin HCl. Remove venting device. 
* SHAKE VIGOROUSLY. 
* WAIT FOR A MINIMUM OF 10 MINUTES BEFORE USING, KEEPING THE MEDICINE 
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. </p>
<p>The Techne DB-3 Dri Block Heater is fully validated for use in the constitution of Myocet liposomal. 
Three inserts, each with two 43.7mm openings per insert must be used. To ensure correct temperature 
control the use of a 35mm immersion thermometer is recommended. </p>
<p>The resulting reconstituted preparation of Myocet liposomal contains 50 mg of doxorubicin HCl/25 ml 
of concentrate for liposomal dispersion for infusion (2 mg/ml).  </p>
<p>After reconstitution the finished product must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride 
solution for injection, or 5% (w/v) glucose solution for injection to a final volume of 40 ml to 120 ml 
per 50 mg reconstituted Myocet liposomal so that a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml to 1.2 mg/ml 
doxorubicin is obtained. </p>
<p>Once constituted, the liposomal dispersion for infusion containing liposome encapsulated doxorubicin 
should be a red-orange opaque homogeneous dispersion. All parenteral medicinal products should be 
inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the 
preparation if foreign particulate matter is present. </p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that once reconstituted Myocet liposomal has a chemical and physical in-use 
stability at room temperature for up to 8 hours or in a refrigerator (2 C-8 C) for up to 5 days.  </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 C-8 C, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken 
place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. </p>
<p>Myocet liposomal should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour.<br />
Warning: Myocet liposomal must not be administered by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route or 
as a bolus injection. </p>
<ol>
<li>DISPOSAL </li>
</ol>
<p>Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. </p>         </div>"""
