If you have experienced life-threatening allergic (hypersensitive) reactions to alglucosidase alfa or any 
of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) and re-administration of the medicine was 
not successful. Symptoms of life-threatening allergic reactions include, but are not limited to, low 
blood pressure, very fast heart rate, difficulty breathing, vomiting, facial swelling, hives or rash. </p>
<p>Warnings and Precautions 
If you are treated with Myozyme, you may experience an infusion-associated reaction while you are 
being given the medicine or during the hours following the infusion. Such a reaction comprises 
different symptoms like low blood pressure, chest discomfort, throat tightness, face, lips or tongue 
swelling (angioedema), hives (urticaria), dizziness, rash, itchy skin, nausea, vomiting, cough and 
bronchospasm (see section 4 for an overview of all infusion-associated reactions). An infusion-
associated reaction can sometimes be very severe. If you experience a reaction like this, you should 
tell your doctor immediately. You may need to be given pre-treatment medicines to prevent an 
allergic reaction (e.g. antihistamines and/or corticosteroids) or to reduce fever (antipyretics). 
In studies doctors have used medicines to suppress the immune system to reduce the production of 
antibodies. Because you have Pompe disease, there is a risk that you get a severe infection of your 
airways or lungs. Using these medicines to suppress the immune system may further increase this risk. 
If you experience severe ulcerative lesions of your skin, please inform your doctor. If you experience 
swelling of your lower limbs or generalized swelling, please inform your doctor. Your doctor should 
consider discontinuation of the administration of Myozyme and initiate appropriate medical treatment. 
Your doctor should consider the risks and benefits of re-administering Myozyme. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Myozyme 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility 
There is limited experience of the use of Myozyme in pregnant women. You should not be using 
Myozyme during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. There 
is limited experience suggesting that Myozyme passes into human breast milk in very small amounts. 
No effects on the breastfeed infant is expected. Therefore breastfeeding during the treatment may be 
considered. However, you can discuss with your doctor whether to interrupt breastfeeding as a 
precautionary measure for the first 24 hours after each dose of Myozyme. If you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Take care when driving or using any tools or machines shortly after infusion of Myozyme, since you 
may experience dizziness, sleepiness, shaking, and/or low blood pressure. </p>
<p>Myozyme contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially  sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

Myozyme is given through a drip into a vein (by intravenous infusion). It is supplied as a powder

If you are given Myozyme at a higher dose or infusion rate than recommended, you may experience
