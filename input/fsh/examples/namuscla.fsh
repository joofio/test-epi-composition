- if you also take certain medicines which have a narrow therapeutic window (see Other 
medicines and Namuscla). </p>
<p>If you have any doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before taking Namuscla if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>heart problems<br />
Internal Doc Ref: v6.6 </li>
<li>liver problems </li>
<li>kidney problems </li>
<li>low or high potassium blood levels </li>
<li>low magnesium blood levels </li>
<li>epilepsy  </li>
</ul>
<p>Heart function 
Before starting treatment with Namuscla, you will have tests to check how well your heart is working, 
including ECG (Electrocardiogram). These tests will also be performed regularly during treatment 
with Namuscla, and before and after your dose of Namuscla is modified. How often these tests will be 
performed depends on your heart function.<br />
If you or your doctor detects any heart rhythm disturbances or any of the conditions stated in section 
 Do not take Namuscla , your doctor will stop your treatment with Namuscla. </p>
<p>If you notice that the rhythm of your heart changes (the heart beats faster or slower), if you feel 
fluttering or pain in your chest, if you have difficulty breathing, if you feel dizzy, if you sweat or if 
you faint, you have to contact an emergency centre immediately. </p>
<p>Some patients may have higher blood levels of Namuscla because of slower break down in the liver 
and the dose may need to be adjusted accordingly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Namuscla should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Namuscla 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Do not take Namuscla with certain medicines for treating heart rhythm disorders (quinidine, 
procainamide, disopyramide, ajmaline, encainide, flecainide, propafenone, moricizine, amiodarone, 
sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, dronedarone, vernakalant). See section  Do not take Namuscla . Taking 
Namuscla together with any of these medicines increases the risk of a serious heart rhythm disturbance 
called torsades de pointes. </p>
<p>Do not take Namuscla with certain medicines which have a so called narrow therapeutic window 
(these are medicines where small differences in dose or blood concentration may impact the effect of 
the medicine or side effects). Examples of such medicines are digoxin (for heart problems), lithium 
(mood stabiliser), phenytoin (for treating epilepsy), theophylline (against asthma) and warfarin 
(against blood clots).  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following since these medicines may affect 
or be affected by Namuscla:<br />
<em> medicines for heart problems (lidocaine, tocainide, propranolol, esmolol, metoprolol, atenolol, 
carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol, verapamil, diltiazem),<br />
</em> certain other medicines:  * timolol for treating high pressure in the eye (glaucoma),<br />
 * certain antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, rifampicin),  * certain antidepressants (fluvoxamine),  * tizanidine (used to relax the muscles),  * metformin (used against diabetes) * omeprazole (to treat stomach ulcer and gastric acid reflux).  </p>
<p>Smoking and Namuscla 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you start to smoke or quit smoking while taking Namuscla because 
smoking impacts the Namuscla blood levels and your dose may need to be adjusted accordingly. </p>
<p>Internal Doc Ref: v6.6 
Namuscla with drink 
It is recommended to reduce your caffeine intake by half while on treatment with mexiletine because 
the medicine can increase caffeine levels in your blood. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. If you become pregnant while taking Namuscla, 
see your doctor immediately as it is preferable not to take Namuscla while you are pregnant. If you 
become pregnant while taking Namuscla, see your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Mexiletine passes into human milk. You should talk to your doctor about this, together you will make 
a decision whether to abstain breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from mexiletine therapy. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Namuscla may in rare cases cause tiredness, confusion, blurred vision: If you have these effects do not 
drive, cycle and use machines.  </p>         </div>"""
