  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Neulasta contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by 
biotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very 
similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. </p>
<p>Neulasta is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence 
of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are 
important as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of 
chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells 
fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an 
increased risk of infection. </p>
<p>Your doctor has given you Neulasta to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes 
blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. </p>         </div>"""

<li>if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Neulasta: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the 
skin that itch. </li>
<li>
<p>if you have an allergy to latex. The needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of 
latex and may cause severe allergic reactions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute 
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, 
difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of 
tiredness. 
These could be symptoms of a condition called  Capillary Leak Syndrome  which causes blood 
to leak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4. * if you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a 
problem with your spleen (splenomegaly). </p>
</li>
<li>if you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary 
oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung 
infiltration). </li>
<li>if you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) 
or decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot 
(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. </li>
<li>if you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. </li>
<li>if you are a patient with breast cancer or lung cancer, Neulasta in combination with 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may increase your risk of a precancerous blood 
condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a blood cancer called acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML). Symptoms may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. </li>
<li>if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the 
face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing 
these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction. </li>
<li>if you have symptoms of inflammation of aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood 
from the heart to the body), this has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. 
The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased 
inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience those symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Neulasta can harm the tiny filters inside your 
kidneys (glomerulonephritis). </p>
<p>Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of Neulasta. Stop 
using Neulasta and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in 
section 4. You should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or 
are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Neulasta, unless instructed by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Loss of response to pegfilgrastim </p>
<p>If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, 
your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise pegfilgrastim s activity. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Neulasta </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Neulasta has not been tested in 
pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: 
* are pregnant; 
* think you may be pregnant; or 
* are planning to have a baby. </p>
<p>Unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Neulasta. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Neulasta has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Neulasta contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 50 mg/mL. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

pharmacist if you are unsure. The usual dose is one 6 mg subcutaneous injection (injection under your 
skin) and it should be given at least 24 hours after your last dose of chemotherapy at the end of each 
chemotherapy cycle. </p>
<p>Injecting Neulasta yourself </p>
<p>Your doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject Neulasta yourself. Your 
doctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself. Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been

<p>Please tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following or combination of the following 
side effects: 
* swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty 
breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These 
symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. </p>
<p>These could be symptoms of an uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) condition called 
 Capillary Leak Syndrome  which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body 
and needs urgent medical attention. </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
* bone pain. Your doctor will tell you what you can take to ease the bone pain. 
* nausea and headaches. </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
* pain at the site of injection. 
* general aches and pains in the joints and muscles. 
* some changes may occur in your blood, but these will be detected by routine blood tests. Your 
white blood cell count may become high for a short period of time. Your platelet count may 
become low which might result in bruising. </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
* allergic-type reactions, including redness and flushing, skin rash, and raised areas of the skin 
that itch. 
* serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face). 
* increased spleen size. 
* spleen rupture. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. It is important that you contact your 
doctor immediately if you experience pain in the upper left side of the abdomen or left shoulder 
pain since this may relate to a problem with your spleen. 
* breathing problems. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing please tell your doctor. 
* Sweet s syndrome (plum-coloured, raised, painful lesions on the limbs and sometimes the face 
and neck with fever) has occurred but other factors may play a role. 
* cutaneous vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin). 
* damage to the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis). 
* redness at the site of injection. 
* coughing up blood (haemoptysis). 
* blood disorders (myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] or acute myeloid leukaemia [AML]). </p>
<p>Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people): 
* inflammation of aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body), 
see section 2. * bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage). 
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which can appear as reddish target-like or circular patches often 
with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes 
and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. Stop using Neulasta if you develop these 
symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. See also section 2. Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting
