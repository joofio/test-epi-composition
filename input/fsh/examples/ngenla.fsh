- If you or the child in your care are allergic to somatrogon (see Warnings and precautions) or any 
of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
- If you or the child in your care have an active tumour (cancer). Tell your doctor if you or the 
child in your care have or have had an active tumour. Tumours must be inactive, and you or the 
child in your care must have finished your anti-tumour treatment before starting treatment with 
Ngenla. 
- If you or the child in your care have stopped growing because of closure of the growth plates 
(closed epiphyses) meaning that you or the child in your care have been told by your doctor that 
your bones have stopped growing. 
- If you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open 
heart surgery, abdominal surgery, acute respiratory failure, multiple accidental trauma or similar 
conditions). If you or the child in your care are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or </p>
<p>go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that 
you use growth hormone. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ngenla:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you or the child in your care develop a serious allergic reaction, stop using Ngenla, talk to 
your doctor right away. Sometimes serious allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity, including 
anaphylaxis or angioedema (difficulties breathing or swallowing, or swelling of the face, lips, 
throat or tongue) have occurred. If you or the child in your care have any of the following 
symptoms of a serious allergic reaction:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>breathing problems </p>
</li>
<li>swelling of your face, mouth, and tongue </li>
<li>hives (nettle rash, lumps rising under the skin) </li>
<li>rash </li>
<li>fever  </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care have replacement therapy with corticosteroid medicines 
(glucocorticoids) you or the child in your care should consult your doctor regularly as you or the 
child in your care may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. </li>
<li>Your doctor should check at intervals how well the thyroid gland is working in you or the child 
in your care and if necessary may prescribe treatment or adjust the dose of existing treatment as 
this may be needed for Ngenla to work properly.  </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care have Prader-Willi syndrome, you or the child should not be 
treated with Ngenla unless you or the child in your care has growth hormone deficiency. </li>
<li>Your doctor should monitor you or the child in your care for high blood sugar levels 
(hyperglycaemia) during treatment with Ngenla. If you or the child in your care are treated with 
insulin or other diabetes medicines, your doctor may need to adjust the insulin dose. If you or 
the child in your care have diabetes and associated severe/worsening eye disease you or the 
child in your care should not be treated with Ngenla. </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care have ever had any kind of tumour (cancer). </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care experience changes in vision, severe or frequent headaches, 
associated with feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, or experience lack of muscle control or 
coordination of voluntary movements, such as walking or picking up objects, difficulty with 
speech, eye movement or swallowing, especially at the start of treatment, tell your doctor 
immediately. These could be signs of a temporary increase in pressure within the brain 
(intracranial hypertension).  </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open 
heart surgery, abdominal surgery, acute respiratory failure, multiple accidental trauma or similar 
conditions). If you or the child in your care are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or 
go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that 
you or the child in your care use growth hormone. </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care develop a severe stomach ache during treatment with Ngenla as 
this could be a symptom of inflammation of the pancreas. </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care notice a sideways curvature in your spine (scoliosis), you or the 
child in your care will need to be checked often by your doctor.  </li>
<li>If during growing you or the child in your care develop a limp or hip or knee pain, you or the 
child in your care should consult your doctor right away. These could be symptoms of bone 
disorders in your hip as this may happen during periods of rapid growth. </li>
<li>If you or the child in your care are taking or stop taking oral contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy with oestrogen, your doctor may recommend the dose of Ngenla to be 
adjusted. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Ngenla 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or the child in your care are using, have recently used or 
might use any other medicines.<br />
- If you or the child in your care take replacement therapy with corticosteroid medicines 
(glucocorticoids), as these may reduce the effect of Ngenla on growth. You or the child in your </p>
<p>care should consult your doctor regularly, as you or the child in your care may need adjustment 
of your glucocorticoid dose. 
- If you or the child in your care are treated with insulin or other diabetes medicines, you should 
consult with your doctor as you or your doctor may need to adjust the dose. 
- If you or the child in your care are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones, your doctor may 
need to adjust the dose. 
- If you or the child in your care are receiving oestrogen taken orally, you should consult your 
doctor as you or the child may need to adjust your dose of Ngenla. 
- If you or the child in your care are receiving ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune 
system after transplantation), you should consult your doctor as your doctor may need to adjust 
the dose. 
- If you or the child in your care are receiving medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants), 
you should consult your doctor as your doctor may need to adjust the dose. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you or the child in your care are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you or the child in your care may 
be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Ngenla has not been tested in pregnant women and it is not known if this medicine can harm your 
unborn baby. It is therefore preferable to avoid Ngenla during pregnancy. If you are able to get 
pregnant, you should not use Ngenla unless you are also using reliable contraception. </p>
<p>It is not known whether somatrogon can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor or the doctor of the 
child in your care, if you or the child in your care are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will 
then help you or the child in your care decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking 
Ngenla, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Ngenla to you or the 
child in your care. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ngenla does not affect the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Ngenla contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>
<p>Ngenla contains metacresol 
Ngenla contains a preservative called metacresol. In very rare cases the presence of metacresol can 
cause inflammation (swelling) in muscles. If you or the child in your care experience muscle pain or 
pain at the injection site, inform your doctor.  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>This medicine will only be prescribed by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone treatment 
and who has confirmed your diagnosis or that of the child in your care. </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>The dose of Ngenla to be injected will be decided by your doctor.  </p>
<p>How much to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose of Ngenla from your body weight in kilograms. The 
recommended dose is 0.66 mg per kg body weight and is given once weekly. If you or the child in </p>
<p>your care have been previously treated with daily growth hormone injections, your doctor will tell you 
to wait before taking the first dose of Ngenla until the day after your last daily injection and then 
continue with Ngenla once each week. </p>
<p>Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to. </p>
<p>How Ngenla is given 
- Ngenla is available as a pre-filled pen in 2 different sizes (Ngenla 24 mg and Ngenla 60 mg). 
Based on the recommended dose your doctor or the doctor of the child in your care will 
prescribe the most appropriate pen size (see section 6  Contents of the pack and other 
information ). 
- Before you or the child in your care use the pen for the first time, your/their doctor or nurse will 
show you how to use it. Ngenla is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) 
using a pre-filled pen. Do not inject it into a vein or muscle.<br />
- The best place to give Ngenla is in the abdomen (belly), thighs, buttocks or upper arms. 
Injections to the upper arms and buttocks should be given by the caregiver. 
- Change the site of injection on your body, or on the body of the child in your care, each time a 
dose is administered.<br />
- If more than one injection is required to deliver a complete dose, each should be administered at 
a different injection site. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions for use of the pre-filled pen are at the end of this leaflet.  </p>
<p>When to use Ngenla 
You or the child in your care should use this medicine once a week on the same day each week.  </p>
<p>You or the child in your care should record which day of the week you use Ngenla to help you or the 
child in your care remember to inject this medicine once a week. </p>
<p>If necessary you or the child in your care can change the day of your/their weekly injection as long as 
it has been at least 3 days since you or the child in your care had your/their last injection. After 
selecting a new dosing day, continue giving yourself or the child in your care the injection on that day 
each week. </p>
<p>If you use more Ngenla than you should 
If you or the child in your care have injected more Ngenla than you should have been given, contact 
your doctor straight away as your/their blood sugar levels may need to be checked.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Ngenla 
If you or the child in your care forgot to inject a dose and:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is 3 days or less since you or the child in your care should have used Ngenla, use it as soon as 
you remember. Then inject your/their next dose on your/their usual injection day. </li>
<li>It is more than 3 days since you or the child in your care should have used Ngenla, skip the 
missed dose. Then inject your/their next dose as usual on your/their next scheduled day. A 
regular dosing day should be maintained. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Ngenla 
Do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
