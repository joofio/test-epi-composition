of Norvir but a full dose of Norvir must not be taken together with these two medicines. 
If you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about switching to a different 
medicine while you are taking Norvir. 
Also read the list of medicines under  Other medicines and Norvir  for use with certain other

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Norvir.
Important information
-
If Norvir is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important that you 
also carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines.  There may be 
additional information in those leaflets about situations when Norvir should be avoided.  If you 
have any further questions about Norvir (ritonavir) or the other medicines prescribed, please ask 
your doctor or pharmacist.
-
Norvir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS.
-
People taking Norvir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection or AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your 
doctor while taking Norvir.
Tell your doctor if you have/had:
-
A history of liver disease.<br />
-
Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at 
a greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the 
liver.  Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly.
-
Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia who 
are taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors).  The reason for this is not known.  You 
may need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any 
bleeding.
-
Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension 
and prolonged erection.
-
Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes 
mellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors.
-
Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines 
(such as protease inhibitors).
Tell your doctor if you experience:
-
Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the 
medicines you are taking work.
-
Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of 
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).  Some patients taking Norvir can develop serious 
problems with their pancreas.  Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you.
-
Symptoms of infection   inform your doctor immediately.  Some patients with advanced HIV 
infection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections 
they have had in the past even if they didn t know they had had them.  It is believed that this 
happens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these 
infections.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.
-
Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty 
moving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone 
(osteonecrosis).  Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this 
disease. 
-
Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy 
including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle 
disorders have been serious. (See section 4. Possible side effects).
-
Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat.  Some patients taking 
Norvir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG).  Tell your doctor if you have a 
heart defect or conduction defect.
-
If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can.
Children and adolescents
Norvir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age.
Other medicines and Norvir
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. There are some medicines you cannot 
take at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, under  Do not take Norvir .  There are 
some other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below.
The following warnings apply when Norvir is taken as a full dose.  However, these warnings may also 
apply when Norvir is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be 
taken.
-
Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction).<br />
The dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid 
hypotension and prolonged erection.  You must not take Norvir with sildenafil if you suffer from 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know before you or 
your child takes Norvir). Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.
-
Colchicine (for gout) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of this medicine. You must not take 
Norvir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also  Do not take Norvir<br />
above).
-
Digoxin (heart medicine).  Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you 
while you are taking digoxin and Norvir in order to avoid heart problems.
-
Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol as Norvir may reduce the effectiveness 
of these medicines.  It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of 
contraception is used instead.  You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking 
this type of hormonal contraceptive with Norvir.
-
Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of 
these medicines.  Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with 
Norvir (see also  Do not take Norvir  above).
-
Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as Norvir 
may raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing s syndrome 
(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol.  Your doctor 
may wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely.
-
Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood 
pressure and fainting can occur when taken with Norvir. 
-
Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver 
damage can occur when taken with Norvir.
-
Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as Norvir may increase the 
blood levels of this medicine.
There are medicines that may not mix with Norvir because their effects could increase or decrease 
when taken together.  In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or 
monitor you regularly.  This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, 
including those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention 
these: 
-
amphetamine or amphetamine derivatives;
-
antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin); 
-
anticancer treatments (e.g. abemaciclib, afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, dasatinib,

nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone);
-
antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); 
-
antihistamines (e.g. loratadine, fexofenadine); 
-
antiretroviral medicines, including HIV-protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, 
fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTI) (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and others (didanosine, maraviroc, 
raltegravir, zidovudine); 
-
anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline and delamanid);

There are some medicines you cannot take at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, 
under  Do not take Norvir .
Taking Norvir with food and drink
See section 3. Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, it is very 
important that you ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
There is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active ingredient in Norvir) during 
pregnancy.  In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months of pregnancy at 
a lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors.  Norvir did not appear to increase the 
chance of developing birth defects compared to the general population.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Norvir can cause dizziness.  If you are affected do not drive or use machinery. </p>         </div>"""

For doses of exactly 100 mg amounts (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 600 mg) pour the entire content of 
each sachet over soft food (apple sauce or vanilla pudding) or mix with a small amount of liquid 
(water, chocolate milk, or infant formula) and consume entire serving.
For doses less than 100 mg amounts or doses between 100 mg amounts, the content of the entire 
sachet is to be mixed with a liquid and then dosed by the appropriate ml volume as told to you 
by your doctor using the oral dosing syringe. 
For administration using a feeding tube follow the instructions in section  How do I take the correct 
dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension mixed with liquid?  Use water to mix the medicine and 
follow the feeding tube instructions to administer the medicine.
Recommended doses of Norvir are:</p>
<p>if Norvir is used to boost the effects of other anti-HIV medicines, the typical dose for adults is 1 
or 2 sachets once or twice daily.  For more detailed dose recommendations, including those for 
children, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Norvir is given in combination 
with.</p>
<p>if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 sachets in the morning 
and 3 sachets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose 
of 6 sachets twice daily. Children (2   12 years of age) will start with a dose smaller than this 
and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size.<br />
Your doctor will advise you on the dosage to be taken.
Norvir should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you feel.  If a 
side effect is preventing you from taking Norvir, tell your doctor straight away.  During episodes of 
diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed.
Always keep enough Norvir on hand so you don't run out.  When you travel or need to stay in the 
hospital, make sure you have enough Norvir to last until you can get a new supply.
Norvir powder for oral suspension has a lingering aftertaste.  Eating peanut butter, hazelnut chocolate 
spread, or black currant syrup immediately after taking the medication may help clear the aftertaste 
from your mouth. 
Prepare only one dose at a time using the correct number of sachets. When mixing the powder with 
food or liquid, be sure to take the whole dose within 2 hours. Do not mix Norvir with anything else 
without talking to your doctor or pharmacist.<br />

If you take more Norvir than you should
Numbness, tingling, or a  pins and needles  sensation may occur if you take too much Norvir.  If you 
realise you have taken more Norvir than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the Accident 
and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away. 
If you forget to take Norvir
If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible.  If it is nearly time for the next dose, just 
take that one.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Norvir
Even if you feel better, do not stop taking Norvir without talking to your doctor.  Taking Norvir as 
recommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the medicines.</p>         </div>"""
