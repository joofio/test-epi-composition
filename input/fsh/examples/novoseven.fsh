when the body's own clotting factors are not working. </p>
<p>NovoSeven is used to treat bleeding, and to prevent excessive bleeding after surgery or other 
important treatments. Early treatment with NovoSeven reduces how much you bleed and for how long. 
It works in all types of bleeds, including joint bleeds. This reduces the need for hospitalisation and 
days absent from work and school. 
It is used in certain groups of people: 
* If you were born with haemophilia and do not respond normally to factors VIII or IX treatment 
* If you have acquired haemophilia 
* If you have Factor VII deficiency 
* If you have Glanzmann s thrombasthenia (a bleeding disorder) and your condition cannot be 
treated effectively with platelet transfusion, or if platelets are not readily available. </p>
<p>NovoSeven can also be given to you by a doctor to treat heavy bleeding after delivery of your baby, 
even if you do not have a bleeding disorder. </p>         </div>"""

ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* If you are allergic to mouse, hamster or cow proteins (such as cows  milk). </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, do not use NovoSeven. Talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before treatment with NovoSeven, make sure your doctor knows: 
* If you have just had surgery 
* If you recently had a crush injury 
* If your arteries are narrowed by disease (atherosclerosis) 
* If you have an increased risk of blood clots (thrombosis) 
* If you have severe liver disease 
* If you have a serious blood infection 
* If you are prone to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, a condition where blood clots 
develop throughout the blood stream) you must be carefully monitored. </p>
<p>If any of these conditions apply to you, talk to your doctor before using the injection. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NovoSeven 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use NovoSeven at the same time as prothrombin complex concentrates or rFXIII. You should 
talk to your doctor before using NovoSeven if you also use Factor VIII or IX products. </p>
<p>There is limited experience of using NovoSeven together with medicines called antifibrinolytic drugs 
(such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) which are also used to control bleeding. You should 
talk to your doctor before using NovoSeven with these medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you use NovoSeven. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
There are no studies on the effect of NovoSeven on the ability to drive and use machines. However, 
there is no medical reason to think that it would affect your ability. </p>
<p>NovoSeven contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, i.e. essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>When to treat yourself 
Start treatment of a bleed as early as possible, ideally within 2 hours. 
* In cases of a mild or moderate bleed, you should treat yourself as early as possible, ideally at 
home. 
* In case of a severe bleed you should contact your doctor. Usually severe bleeds are treated at the 
hospital and you can give yourself the first NovoSeven dose on the way there. </p>
<p>Do not treat yourself for longer than 24 hours without consulting your doctor. 
* Each time you use NovoSeven, tell your doctor or hospital as soon as possible. 
* If bleeding is not controlled within 24 hours, contact your doctor immediately. You will usually 
need hospital care. </p>
<p>Dose 
The first dose should be given as early as possible after bleeding has started. Talk to your doctor about 
when to use the injections and how long to keep using them. 
The dose will be worked out by your doctor, based on your body weight, condition and type of bleed. 
To achieve the best results, follow the prescribed dose carefully. Your doctor might change the dose. </p>
<p>If you have haemophilia: 
The usual dose is 90 micrograms for every 1 kilogram you weigh; you can repeat the injection every 
2 3 hours until bleeding is controlled. 
Your doctor may recommend a single dose of 270 micrograms for every 1 kilogram you weigh. There 
is no clinical experience in people over 65 using this single dose. </p>
<p>If you have Factor VII deficiency: 
The usual dose range is 15 to 30 micrograms for every 1 kilogram you weigh, for each injection. </p>
<p>If you have Glanzmann s thrombasthenia: 
The usual dose is 90 micrograms (range is 80 to 120 micrograms) for every 1 kilogram you weigh, for 
each injection. </p>
<p>If you inject more NovoSeven than you should 
If you inject too much NovoSeven, get medical advice at once. </p>

<p>Instructions on how to use NovoSeven </p>
<p>READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING NOVOSEVEN </p>
<p>NovoSeven is supplied as a powder. Before injection (administration) it must be reconstituted with the solvent 
supplied in the syringe. The solvent is a histidine solution. The reconstituted NovoSeven must be injected into 
your vein (intravenous injection). The equipment in this package is designed to reconstitute and inject 
NovoSeven. </p>
<p>You will also need an administration set (tubing and butterfly needle, sterile alcohol swabs, gauze pads and 
plasters). These devices are not included in the NovoSeven package. </p>
<p>Do not use the equipment without proper training from your doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>Always wash your hands and ensure that the area around you is clean. </p>
<p>When you prepare and inject medication directly into the vein, it is important to use a clean and germ free 
(aseptic) technique. Improper technique can introduce germs that can infect the blood. </p>
<p>Do not open the equipment until you are ready to use it. </p>
<p>Do not use the equipment if it has been dropped, or if it is damaged. Use a new package instead. </p>
<p>Do not use the equipment if it is expired. Use a new package instead. The expiry date is printed after  EXP<br />
on the outer carton, on the vial, on the vial adapter and on the pre-filled syringe.  </p>
<p>Do not use the equipment if you suspect it is contaminated. Use a new package instead. </p>
<p>Do not dispose of any of the items until after you have injected the reconstituted solution. </p>
<p>The equipment is for single use only. </p>

<p>Injecting NovoSeven with pre-filled syringe via needleless connectors for intravenous (IV) catheters </p>
<p>Caution: The pre-filled syringe is made of glass and is designed to be compatible with standard luer-lock 
connections. Some needleless connectors with an internal spike are incompatible with the pre-filled syringe. 
This incompatibility may prevent administration of the drug and/or result in damage to the needleless 
connector. </p>
<p>Follow the instructions for use for the needleless connector. Administration through a needleless connector may 
require withdrawal of the reconstituted solution into a standard 10 ml sterile luer-lock plastic syringe. This 
should be done right after step J. </p>
<ol>
<li>Inject the reconstituted solution </li>
</ol>
<p>NovoSeven is now ready to inject into your vein.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inject the reconstituted solution as instructed by your doctor or nurse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inject slowly over 2 to 5 minutes. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Injecting the solution via a central venous access device (CVAD) such as a central venous catheter or a 
subcutaneous port: 
* Use a clean and germ free (aseptic) technique. Follow the instructions for proper use for your connector 
and CVAD in consultation with your doctor or nurse. 
* Injecting into a CVAD may require using a sterile 10 ml plastic syringe for withdrawal of the 
reconstituted solution. 
* If the CVAD line needs to be flushed before or after NovoSeven injection, use sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
solution for injection. </p>
<p>Disposal </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After injection, safely dispose of the syringe 
with the administration set, the vial with the vial
