 antifungals . It is used to prevent and treat many different fungal infections.
This medicine works by killing or stopping the growth of some types of fungi that can cause
infections. 
Noxafil can be used in adults to treat the following types of fungal infections when other antifungal
medicines have not worked or you have had to stop taking them:
* infections caused by fungi of the Aspergillus family that have not improved during treatment
with the antifungal medicines amphotericin B or itraconazole or when these medicines have had
to be stopped;
* infections caused by fungi of the Fusarium family that have not improved during treatment with
amphotericin B or when amphotericin B has had to be stopped;
* infections caused by fungi that cause the conditions known as  chromoblastomycosis  and
 mycetoma  that have not improved during treatment with itraconazole or when itraconazole
has had to be stopped;
* infections caused by a fungus called Coccidioides that have not improved during treatment with
one or more of amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or when these medicines have had
to be stopped;
* Infections in the mouth or throat area (known as  thrush ) caused by fungi called Candida,
which were not previously treated.
This medicine can also be used to prevent fungal infections in adults who are at high-risk of getting a
fungal infection, such as:
* patients who have a weak immune system due to having chemotherapy for  acute myelogenous
leukaemia  (AML) or  myelodysplastic syndromes  (MDS) 
* patients having  high-dose immunosuppressive therapy  after  hematopoietic stem cell
transplant  (HSCT).</p>         </div>"""

* if you are taking: terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine, quinidine, any
medicines that contain  ergot alkaloids  such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine, or a  statin 
such as simvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin.
* if you have just started taking venetoclax or your venetoclax dose is being slowly increased for
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
Do not take Noxafil if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or
pharmacist before taking Noxafil.
See  Other medicines and Noxafil  below for more information including information on other
medicines which may interact with Noxafil.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Noxafil if you: 
* have had an allergic reaction to another antifungal medicine such as ketoconazole, fluconazole,
itraconazole or voriconazole. 
* have or have ever had liver problems. You may need to have blood tests while you are taking
this medicine.
* develop severe diarrhoea or vomiting, as these conditions may limit the effectiveness of this
medicine.
* have an abnormal heart rhythm tracing (ECG) that shows a problem called long QTc interval
* have a weakness of the heart muscle or heart failure
* have a very slow heartbeat
* have heart rhythm disturbance
* have any problem with potassium, magnesium or calcium levels in your blood

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before
taking Noxafil.
If you develop severe diarrhoea or vomiting (being sick) while taking Noxafil, talk to your doctor,
pharmacist or nurse straight away, as this may stop it from working properly. See section 4 for more
information.
Children
Noxafil oral suspension should not be used in children and adolescents (17 years of age and younger).
Other medicines and Noxafil
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines.
Do not take Noxafil if you are taking any of the following:
* terfenadine (used to treat allergies)
* astemizole (used to treat allergies)
* cisapride (used to treat stomach problems)
* pimozide (used to treat symptoms of Tourette's and mental illness) 
* halofantrine (used to treat malaria)
* quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms).
Noxafil can increase the amount of these medicines in the blood which may lead to very serious
changes to your heart rhythm.
* any medicines that contain  ergot alkaloids  such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine used to
treat migraines. Noxafil can increase the amount of these medicines in the blood which may
lead to a severe decrease in blood flow to your fingers or toes and could cause damage to them.
* a  statin  such as simvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin used to treat high cholesterol.
* venetoclax when used at the start of the treatment of a type of cancer, chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia (CLL)
Do not take Noxafil if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or
pharmacist before taking this medicine.
Other medicines
Look at the list of medicines given above that must not be taken while you are taking Noxafil. In
addition to the medicines named above there are other medicines that carry a risk of rhythm problems
that may be greater when they are taken with Noxafil. Please make sure you tell your doctor about all
the medicines you are taking (prescribed or non-prescribed).
Certain medicines may increase the risk of side effects of Noxafil by increasing the amount of Noxafil
in the blood. 
The following medicines may decrease the effectiveness of Noxafil by decreasing the amount of
Noxafil in the blood:
* rifabutin and rifampicin (used to treat certain infections). If you are already taking rifabutin, you
will need a blood test and you will need to look out for some possible side effects of rifabutin.
* phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or primidone (used to treat or prevent fits).
* efavirenz and fosamprenavir used to treat HIV infection.
* medicines used to decrease stomach acid such as cimetidine and ranitidine or omeprazole and
similar medicines that are called proton pump inhibitors.</p>
<p>Noxafil may possibly increase the risk of side effects of some other medicines by increasing the
amount of these medicines in the blood. These medicines include:
* vincristine, vinblastine and other  vinca alkaloids  (used to treat cancer)
* venetoclax (used to treat cancer)
* ciclosporin (used during or after transplant surgery)
* tacrolimus and sirolimus (used during or after transplant surgery)
* rifabutin (used to treat certain infections)
* medicines used to treat HIV called protease inhibitors (including lopinavir and atazanavir,
which are given with ritonavir) 
* midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam or other  benzodiazepines  (used as sedatives or muscle
relaxants)
* diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, nisoldipine or other  calcium channel blockers  (used to treat
high blood pressure)
* digoxin (used to treat heart failure)
* glipizide or other  sulfonylureas  (used to treat high blood sugar)
* all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), also called tretinoin (used to treat certain blood cancers).
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking
Noxafil.
