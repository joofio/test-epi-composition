patients with immune primary thrombocytopenia (called ITP). ITP is a disease in which your body s 
immune system destroys its own platelets. Platelets are the cells in your blood that help seal cuts and 
form blood clots. Very low platelet counts can cause bruising and serious bleeding. </p>
<p>Nplate is used to treat adult patients with ITP who may or may not have had their spleen removed and 
who have been previously treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulins, where these treatments 
don t work. Nplate is also used to treat children aged 1 year and over with chronic ITP who may or 
may not have had their spleen removed and who have been previously treated with corticosteroids or 
immunoglobulins, where these treatments don t work. </p>
<p>Nplate works by stimulating the bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce 
more platelets. This should help to prevent bruising and bleeding associated with ITP. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to romiplostim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you are allergic to other medicines that are produced by DNA technology using the 
micro-organism Escherichia coli (E. coli). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you stop taking Nplate a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. If 
you stop taking Nplate your platelet count will have to be monitored, and your doctor will 
discuss appropriate precautions with you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are at risk of blood clots or if blood clots are common in your family. The risk of blood 
clotting may also be increased if you:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have liver problems; </p>
</li>
<li>are elderly (  65 years); </li>
<li>are bedridden; </li>
<li>have cancer; </li>
<li>are taking the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy; </li>
<li>have recently had surgery or suffered an injury; </li>
<li>are obese (overweight); </li>
<li>are a smoker. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nplate. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have very high blood platelet counts this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Your doctor 
will adjust your dose of Nplate to ensure that your platelet count does not become too high. </p>
<p>Bone marrow changes (increased reticulin and possible bone marrow fibrosis) </p>
<p>Long-term use of Nplate may cause changes in your bone marrow. These changes may lead to 
abnormal blood cells or your body making less blood cells. The mild form of these bone marrow 
changes is called  increased reticulin  and has been observed in Nplate clinical trials. It is not known 
if this may progress to a more severe form called  fibrosis.  Signs of bone marrow changes may show 
up as abnormalities in your blood tests. Your doctor will decide if abnormal blood tests mean that you 
should have bone marrow tests or if you should stop taking Nplate. </p>
<p>Worsening of blood cancers </p>
<p>Your doctor may decide to take a bone marrow biopsy if they decide it is necessary to ensure that you 
have ITP, and not another condition such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). If you have MDS and 
receive Nplate you may have an increase in your blast cell counts and your MDS condition may 
worsen to become an acute myeloid leukaemia, which is a type of cancer of the blood. </p>
<p>Loss of response to romiplostim </p>
<p>If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim 
treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you are experiencing 
increased bone marrow fibres (reticulin) or have developed antibodies which neutralise romiplostim s 
activity. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Nplate is not recommended for use in children aged under 1 year. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nplate </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If you are also taking medicines which prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy) 
there is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor will discuss this with you. </p>
<p>If you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, which you may be receiving to treat 
your ITP, these may be reduced or stopped when given together with Nplate. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Nplate is not recommended for use if 
you are pregnant unless indicated by your doctor. </p>
<p>It is not known whether romiplostim is present in human milk. Nplate is not recommended for use if 
you are breast-feeding. A decision on whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue therapy 
with romiplostim should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to your child and 
the benefit of romiplostim therapy to you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You should speak with your doctor before driving or using machines, as some side effects (e.g. 
temporary bouts of dizziness) may impair your ability to do so safely. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Nplate will be given under the direct supervision of your doctor, who will closely control the amount 
of Nplate given to you. </p>
<p>Nplate is administered once a week as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). </p>
<p>Your initial dose is 1 microgram of Nplate per kilogram of your body weight once a week. Your 
doctor will tell you how much you must take. Nplate should be injected once per week in order to keep 
your platelet counts up. Your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your platelets are 
responding and may adjust your dose as necessary. </p>
<p>Once your platelet count is under control, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood. 
Your dose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your platelet count. </p>
<p>Children (1 to 17 years old): in addition to adjusting your dose based on platelet counts, your doctor 
will also regularly reassess your body weight in order to adjust your dose. </p>

<p>Your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given more 
Nplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts 
may rise to very high levels and this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Therefore if your doctor 
suspects that you have been given more Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment 
immediately. </p>
<p>If you use less Nplate than you should </p>
<p>Your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given less

or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment immediately. </p>
