<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to botulinum toxin type A or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); </li>
<li>if you have myasthenia gravis or Eaton Lambert syndrome (chronic diseases affecting the 
muscles); </li>
<li>if you have an infection or inflammation at the proposed injection sites. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Side effects possibly related to the spread of botulinum toxin from the site of injection can occur very 
rarely (e.g. muscle weakness, difficulty in swallowing or food or liquid entering the airways). Patients 
receiving recommended doses may have exaggerated muscle weakness. </p>
<p>Visit your doctor immediately if you find it difficult to swallow, to speak or to breathe after treatment.  </p>
<ul>
<li>NUCEIVA is not recommended in patients who have had problems swallowing (dysphagia) and 
breathing. </li>
<li>Too frequent or excessive dosing may lead to antibody formation. Antibody formation can stop 
botulinum toxin type A from working even for other uses. To prevent this, there must be a gap 
of at least three months between doses. </li>
<li>Very rarely, an allergic reaction can occur after the injection of botulinum toxin. </li>
<li>
<p>Drooping of the eyelid may occur after treatment. 
Please tell your doctor if:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you had problems with previous botulinum toxin injections; </p>
</li>
<li>you see no significant improvement of your lines one month after your first course of treatment; </li>
<li>you suffer from certain diseases affecting your nervous system (such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis or motor neuropathy); </li>
<li>you have inflammation at the proposed injection site(s); </li>
<li>the muscles to be injected are weak or wasted; </li>
<li>you have a bleeding disorder as injection may lead to bruising. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of NUCEIVA is not recommended in individuals under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NUCEIVA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>The use of botulinum toxin is not recommended in association with aminoglycoside antibiotics, 
spectinomycin or other medicines that interfere with nerve impulses to the muscle. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have recently been injected with a medicine containing botulinum toxin (the 
active substance of NUCEIVA), as this may increase the effect of NUCEIVA excessively. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. </p>
<p>The use of NUCEIVA is not recommended during pregnancy and in women able to have children who 
are not using contraception.  </p>
<p>NUCEIVA is not recommended in breast-feeding women. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Muscle weakness, dizziness, and visual disturbance with this medicine could make driving or the use 
of machines dangerous. Do not drive or use machinery until such effects have cleared. </p>
<p>NUCEIVA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose; this means it is essentially 
 sodium- free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR MEDICAL OR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY: </p>
<p>Botulinum toxin units are not interchangeable from one product to another. Doses recommended in 
units are different from other botulinum toxin preparations. </p>
<p>Reconstitution should be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, particularly with respect 
to aseptic technique. NUCEIVA is reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
injection. 1.25 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection is drawn up into a syringe 
in order to obtain a reconstituted solution for injection at a concentration of 4 Units/0.1 mL. </p>
<p>Amount of solvent added to 50 Unit vial<br />
(sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection) 
Resulting dose<br />
(Units per 0.1 mL) 
1.25 mL<br />
4.0 U </p>
<p>The central part of the rubber cap should be cleaned with alcohol. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial 
with a needle through the rubber stopper and gently rotate the vial avoiding bubble formation. The vial 
has to be discarded if the vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Once reconstituted, the 
solution for injection should be visually inspected prior to use to verify it is a clear, colourless solution 
free of particulate matter. </p>
<p>Reconstituted NUCEIVA (50 Units/1.25 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge needle. Four Units 
(4 U/ 0.1 mL) are administered in each of the 5 injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 injections in each 
corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus muscle 
for a total dose of 20 Units. </p>
<p>In order to reduce the complication of eyelid ptosis the following steps should be taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow 
depressor complexes. </li>
<li>Lateral corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. </li>
<li>Ensure the injected volume/dose is accurate and where feasible kept to a minimum. </li>
</ul>
<p>Procedure to follow for safe disposal of vials, syringes and materials used: </p>
<p>Immediately after use, unused reconstituted NUCEIVA solution for injection in the vial and/or the 
syringe must be inactivated, prior to disposal, with 2 mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution at 0.5% 
or 1% available chlorine.  Following inactivation, dispose of in accordance with local requirements. 
Used vials, syringes and materials should not be emptied and must be discarded into appropriate 
containers and disposed of according to local regulations. </p>
<p>Recommendations in the event of an accident when handling botulinum toxin: </p>
<p>In the event of an accident when handling the product, whether in the vacuum-dried state or 
reconstituted, the appropriate measures described below must be initiated immediately. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The toxin is very sensitive to heat and certain chemical agents. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any spillage must be wiped up: either with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of sodium 
hypochlorite (Javel solution) in the case of the vacuum-dried product, or with a dry absorbent 
material in the case of the reconstituted product. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contaminated surfaces must be cleaned with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of 
sodium hypochlorite (Javel solution) and then dried. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a vial is broken, carefully collect the pieces of glass and wipe up the product as stated above, 
avoiding cuts to the skin. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If splashed, wash with a solution of sodium hypochlorite and then rinse thoroughly with plenty of 
water. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If splashed into the eyes, rinse eyes thoroughly with plenty of water or with an eye wash solution. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the operator injures himself (cuts, pricks himself), proceed as above and take the appropriate 
medical steps according to the dose injected. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These instructions for use, handling and disposal should be strictly followed. </p>
