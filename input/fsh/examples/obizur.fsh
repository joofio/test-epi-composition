Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. 
In patients with acquired haemophilia, factor VIII is not working properly because the patient has 
developed antibodies to his own factor VIII which neutralize this blood clotting factor. </p>
<p>OBIZUR is used for the treatment of bleeding episodes in adults with acquired haemophilia (a 
bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII activity due to antibody development). These 
antibodies have less neutralizing effect against OBIZUR than against human factor VIII. </p>
<p>OBIZUR restores this missing factor VIII activity and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding. </p>         </div>"""

<p>You must not be given OBIZUR:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to susoctocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); </li>
<li>if you are allergic to hamster proteins (trace amounts may be present in OBIZUR arising from 
the manufacturing process); </li>
<li>if you have congenital haemophilia A with inhibitors (CHAWI). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given OBIZUR. 
Hypersensitivity 
There is a rare chance that you may experience an allergic reaction to OBIZUR. You should be aware 
of the early signs of allergic reactions (see section 4 for signs and symptoms). If any of these 
symptoms occur, the injection should be stopped. Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing 
and (near) fainting, require emergency treatment in the hospital. </p>
<p>Inhibitors 
Your doctor may check if you have inhibitory antibodies to porcine factor VIII and for increases in 
these antibodies. 
Your doctor will check your blood factor VIII to confirm that enough factor VIII is being given to 
you. Your doctor will also check if the bleeding is adequately controlled. </p>
<p>Cardiovascular events 
Talk to your doctor if you currently have, or have had cardiovascular disease in the past or if you have 
a known risk of thrombosis (diseases from blood clots in normal vasculature), because the possiblity 
of developing thromboembolic diseases at high and sustained blood factor VIII levels cannot be 
excluded. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is no information on the use of OBIZUR in children and adolescents aged under 18 years </p>
<p>Other medicines and OBIZUR 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. No interactions 
of OBIZUR with other medicines are known. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
OBIZUR has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>OBIZUR contains sodium 
This medicine contains 4.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per milliliter once it is 
made up. This is equivalent to 0.23% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium 
for an adult. Multiple vials must be taken per dose. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

haemophilia (bleeding disorders). </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate your dose of OBIZUR (in units or U) depending on your condition and 
body weight. The frequency and duration of administration will depend on how well OBIZUR is 
working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with OBIZUR is a temporary treatment until 
bleeding is resolved or the antibodies against your own factor VIII are eradicated. </p>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you for antibodies to OBIZUR. </p>
<p>The recommended first dose is 200 U per kilogram bodyweight given by intravenous injection. </p>
<p>Your doctor will measure your factor VIII activity regularly to decide the subsequent dose and 
frequency of OBIZUR. 
The bleeding will usually respond within the first 24 hours, your doctor will adjust the dose and 
duration of OBIZUR until the bleeding stops. 
The total volume of reconstituted OBIZUR should be administered at a rate of 1 to 2 mL per minute. </p>
