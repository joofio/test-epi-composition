<p>Odomzo contains the active substance sonidegib. It is an anti-cancer medicine. </p>
<p>What Odomzo is used for </p>
<p>Odomzo is used to treat adults with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma. It is used when the 
cancer has spread locally and cannot be treated with surgery or radiation. </p>
<p>How Odomzo works </p>
<p>The normal growth of cells is controlled by various chemical signals. In patients with basal cell carcinoma, 
changes occur to genes controlling a part of this process known as the  hedgehog pathway . This switches on 
signals that make the cancer cells grow out of control. Odomzo works by blocking this process, stopping 
cancer cells from growing and making new cells. </p>         </div>"""

babies. </p>
<p>Read carefully and follow the instructions of the patient brochure and reminder card given to you by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Do not take Odomzo 
* if you are allergic to sonidegib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. This is because Odomzo may cause harm or death to 
your unborn baby (see section  Pregnancy ). 
* if you are breast-feeding. This is because it is not known whether Odomzo can pass into your breast 
milk and cause harm to your baby (see section  Breast-feeding ). 
* if you are able to become pregnant but are unable or unwilling to follow the necessary pregnancy 
prevention measures that are listed in the Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programme. 
Do not take Odomzo if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
before taking Odomzo. </p>
<p>Additional information on the above points can be found in the sections  Pregnancy ,  Breast-feeding , 
 Fertility  and  Contraception for women and men . </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
- Odomzo may cause muscle problems. Tell your doctor before taking Odomzo if you have a history of 
muscle cramps or weakness or if you are taking other medicines. Some medicines (e.g. medicines used 
to treat high cholesterol) might increase the risk for muscle problems. Tell your doctor or pharmacist 
immediately if your muscles hurt or you have unexplained muscle cramps or weakness during 
treatment with Odomzo. Your doctor may need to change your dose, or stop your treatment 
temporarily or permanently. 
- You should not donate blood while on treatment with Odomzo and for 20 months after ending your 
treatment. 
- If you are male, you should not donate semen at any time during treatment and for 6 months after the 
final dose. 
- Your doctor will check your skin regularly for another type of cancer called cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC). It is not known whether SCC can be related to treatment with Odomzo. Usually this 
type of cancer appears on sun-damaged skin, does not spread and can be cured. Tell your doctor if you 
notice any changes in your skin. 
- Never give this medicine to anyone else. You should return unused capsules at the end of your 
treatment. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist regarding where to return the capsules. </p>
<p>Blood tests during treatment with Odomzo 
Your doctor will perform blood tests before treatment, and possibly during treatment as well. These tests will 
check the health of your muscles by measuring the levels of an enzyme in your blood called creatine 
phosphokinase. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) 
Odomzo should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18. Problems with growing teeth 
and bones were seen with this medicine. Odomzo may cause bones to stop growing in children and 
adolescents. This can also happen after discontinuation of the treatment. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Odomzo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Odomzo can affect 
the way some medicines work. Some other medicines can also affect how Odomzo works, or make it more 
likely that you will have side effects. </p>
<p>In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
* medicines such as statins and fibric acid derivatives used to treat high cholesterol and lipids 
* vitamin B3, also known as niacin 
* medicines such as methotrexate, mitoxantrone, irinotecan, or topotecan used to treat certain types of 
cancers or other diseases such as severe joint problems (rheumatoid arthritis) and psoriasis 
* medicines such as telithromycin, rifampicin or rifabutin used to treat bacterial infections 
* medicines such as ketoconazole (not including shampoos and creams), itraconazole, posaconazole or 
voriconazole used to treat fungal infections 
* medicines such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine used to treat parasitic infections as well as 
other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus erythematosus 
* medicines such as ritonavir, saquinavir or zidovudine used to treat AIDS or HIV 
* medicines such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat acute seizures 
* a medicine called nefazodone used to treat depression 
* a medicine called penicillamine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
* a herbal medicine called St. John s wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum) used to treat 
depression. 
If any of the above apply to you or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Odomzo. </p>
<p>These medicines should be used with caution or may need to be avoided during your treatment with 
Odomzo. If you are taking any of these, your doctor might need to prescribe an alternative medicine for you. </p>
<p>During your treatment with Odomzo, you should also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are prescribed 
another medicine that you were not taking before. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not take Odomzo if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant 
during your treatment or during the 20 months after your treatment has finished. You must stop taking 
Odomzo and talk to your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or suspect you could be pregnant. 
Odomzo may cause your baby to have severe birth defects or lead to the death of your unborn baby. Specific 
instructions (the Odomzo Pregnancy Prevention Programme) given to you by your doctor contain 
information particularly on the effects of Odomzo on unborn babies. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during your treatment or during the 20 months after your treatment has finished. It is not 
known whether Odomzo can pass into your breast milk and cause harm to your baby. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Odomzo may have an impact on fertility in men and women. Talk to your doctor if you plan to have children 
in the future. </p>
<p>Contraception for women and men 
Women 
Before starting Odomzo treatment, ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if your periods 
have stopped (menopause). It is important to check with your doctor whether there is a risk that you could 
become pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are able to become pregnant: 
* you must take precautions so that you do not become pregnant while taking Odomzo, 
* you must use 2 methods of contraception, one highly effective method and one barrier method (see the 
examples below) while you are taking Odomzo, 
* you must keep using this contraception for 20 months after you have stopped taking Odomzo because 
traces of the medicine remain in the body for a long time. 
Your doctor will discuss with you the best method of contraception for you. </p>
<p>You must use one highly effective method, such as: 
* an intra-uterine device ( the coil  or IUD) 
* surgical sterilisation. </p>
<p>You must also use one barrier method, such as: 
* a condom (with spermicide, if available) 
* a diaphragm (with spermicide, if available). </p>
<p>Your doctor will test you for pregnancy: 
* at least 7 days before starting treatment   to make sure that you are not already pregnant 
* every month during treatment. </p>
<p>During treatment and during the 20 months after your treatment has finished, tell your doctor straight away 
if: 
* you think your contraception has not worked for any reason 
* your periods stop 
* you stop using contraception 
* you need to change contraception </p>
<p>Men 
While you are taking Odomzo, always use a condom (with spermicide, if available) when you have sex with 
a female partner, even if you have had a vasectomy. You must keep doing this for 6 months after your 
treatment has finished. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking Odomzo and for 
6 months after your treatment has finished. </p>
<p>You should not donate semen during your treatment and for 6 months after your treatment has finished. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Odomzo is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. Talk to your doctor if you 
are unsure. </p>
<p>Odomzo contains lactose 
Odomzo contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
