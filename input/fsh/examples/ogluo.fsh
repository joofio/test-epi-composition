  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Ogluo contains the active substance glucagon, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
glycogenolytic hormones.  </p>
<p>It is used to treat severe hypoglycaemia (very low blood sugar) in people with diabetes. It is for use in 
adults, adolescents, and children aged 2 years or older. </p>
<p>Ogluo is a ready-to-use, pre-filled pen that contains a single dose of the active substance, glucagon. It 
is a subcutaneous injection, meaning that the medicine is administered under the skin using a needle. </p>
<p>Glucagon is a natural hormone produced by the pancreas, which has the opposite effect of insulin in 
the human body. It helps the liver to convert stored sugar in the liver called  glycogen  into glucose 
(sugar). Glucose is then released into the blood stream, which makes the blood sugar level rise, 
reducing the effects of hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>Information on hypoglycaemia 
Early symptoms of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) include: </p>
<ul>
<li>sweating </li>
<li>drowsiness  </li>
<li>dizziness </li>
<li>sleep disturbances </li>
<li>palpitation  </li>
<li>anxiety  </li>
<li>tremor  </li>
<li>blurred vision  </li>
<li>hunger </li>
<li>slurred speech </li>
<li>depressed mood </li>
<li>tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or 
tongue </li>
<li>irritability </li>
<li>light-headedness </li>
<li>abnormal behaviour </li>
<li>inability to concentrate </li>
<li>
<p>unsteady movement </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>headache </p>
</li>
<li>personality changes</li>

<p>If not treated, the patient may progress to severe hypoglycemia which can include: 
* confusion

<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that you, your family members, people you work with, and close friends know about 
Ogluo. Tell them that if you show any signs of severe hypoglyecaemia, including confusion, 
seizures, or unconciousness (pass out) they should use Ogluo straight away. You should always 
carry Ogluo with you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important that you or those around you know how to use Ogluo before you need it. Show 
your family members and others where you keep Ogluo and how to use it. They must act 
quickly if you become unconscious because if this happens for a period of time, it may be 
harmful. You, or the person administering Ogluo to you, should follow the instructions in 
Section 3 of this leaflet:  How to use Ogluo . </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important that you store Ogluo correctly to make sure that it can be used straight away if 
you need it. See Section 5 for more information on how to store this medicine properly. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use Ogluo if: 
* You are allergic to glucagon or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in 
Section 6). 
* You have a tumour in your adrenal gland (pheochromocytoma). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Ogluo. </p>
<p>Ogluo may not work properly if: 
* You have been fasting or have had low blood sugar levels for a long time 
* You have low levels of adrenaline 
* You have low blood sugar caused by drinking too much alcohol 
* You have a tumour that releases glucagon or insulin  </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Please take into account that approximately 15% of patients achieved glucose recovery after minutes or more in the pivotal trial. </p>
<p>After using Ogluo, eat as soon as possible to prevent the recurrence of low blood sugar. Take a fast-
acting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugar-containing carbonated drink. </p>
<p>Children 
Ogluo is not recommended for children under 2 years of age because it has not been studied in this age 
group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ogluo 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>The following medicines can affect the way that Ogluo works: 
* Insulin   used to treat diabetes. Insulin has the opposite effect of glucagon on blood 
sugar. 
* Indomethacin   used to treat joint pain and stiffness. Indomethacin reduces the effect of 
glucagon. </p>
<p>Ogluo can affect the way that the following medicines work: 
* Warfarin   used to prevent blood clots. Ogluo may increase the blood-thinning effect of 
warfarin. 
* Beta-blockers   used to treat high blood pressure and irregular heart beat. Ogluo may 
increase your blood pressure and pulse but this will only last a short time. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Ogluo. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you experience very low blood sugar when you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be 
pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, you can use Ogluo.  </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
After a severe hypoglycaemic event your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced, you should 
wait until the effects of very low blood sugar have worn off, and you feel better, before driving or 
using any tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Assist </p>
<p>Turn patient onto side. </p>
<p>When an unconscious person wakes up, he or 
she may be sick (vomit). If the patient is 
unconscious, turn them on their side to prevent 
choking (see Figure 9). </p>
<p>Call for emergency medical help right after 
Ogluo has been injected. When the patient has 
responded to the treatment, give him/her a fast-
acting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a 
sugar-containing carbonated drink to prevent 
the recurrence of low blood sugar. If the patient 
does not respond within 15 minutes, an 
additional dose of Ogluo from a new device 
may be administered while waiting for 
emergency assistance. </p>
