Onbrez Breezhaler contains the active substance indacaterol which belongs to a group of medicines 
called bronchodilators. When you inhale it, it relaxes the muscles in the walls of the small air passages 
in the lungs. This helps open up the airways, making it easier to get air in and out. </p>
<p>What Onbrez Breezhaler is used for 
Onbrez Breezhaler is used to make breathing easier for adult patients who have breathing difficulties 
due to a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In COPD the muscles 
around the airways tighten. This makes breathing difficult. This medicine relaxes these muscles in the 
lungs, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. </p>         </div>"""
