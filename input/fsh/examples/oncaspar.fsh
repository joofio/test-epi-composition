important building block of proteins without which cells cannot survive. Normal cells can make 
asparagine for themselves, while some cancer cells cannot. Oncaspar lowers asparagine level in blood 
cancer cells and stops the cancer cells growing. </p>
<p>Oncaspar is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children from birth to 18 years and 
in adults. ALL is a white blood cell cancer type in which certain immature white cells (named 
lymphoblasts) start growing out of control thus preventing the production of functional blood cells. 
Oncaspar is used together with other medicines. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to pegaspargase or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you have severe hepatic disease. </li>
<li>if you have ever had pancreatitis. </li>
<li>if you have ever had severe bleeding following asparaginase therapy. </li>
<li>if you have ever had blood clots following asparaginase therapy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you. If you are the parent of a child who is being 
treated with Oncaspar, please tell the doctor if any of them apply to your child. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Oncaspar. This medicine may not be suitable for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have had serious allergic reactions to other forms of asparaginase, for example itching, 
flushing or swelling of the airways, because major allergic reactions to Oncaspar can occur. </li>
<li>if you suffer from a bleeding disorder or have had serious blood clots. </li>
<li>if you get a fever. This medicine may make you more susceptible to infections. </li>
<li>if you have had poor liver function or are using other medicines which may harm the liver. 
When Oncaspar is used in combination with other cancer treatments, liver and central nervous 
system damage can occur. </li>
<li>if you suffer abdominal pain. Inflammation of the pancreas, that in some cases caused death, can 
occur with Oncaspar treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>This medicine can lead to fluctuations in clotting factors and may increase the risk of bleeding and/or 
clotting. </p>
<p>A side effect called osteonecrosis (bone damage) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in 
children and adolescents receiving Oncaspar (higher incidence seen in girls), when taken 
concomitantly with glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone). </p>
<p>If you are the parent of a child being treated with Oncaspar, tell the doctor if any of the above 
conditions apply to your child. </p>
<p>During treatment with Oncaspar 
During Oncaspar administration you will be closely watched for an hour after the start of treatment for 
any signs of serious allergic reactions. Medical equipment to treat allergic reactions will be available 
nearby. </p>
<p>Additional monitoring tests 
Blood and urine sugar levels, liver and pancreas function and other tests will be carried out regularly 
to monitor your health during and after treatment because this medicine can affect your blood and 
other organs. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Oncaspar 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. This is 
important as Oncaspar may increase the side effects of other medicines through its effect on the liver 
which plays an important role in removing medicines from the body. In addition, it is especially 
important to tell your doctor if you are also using any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>immunisation with live vaccines within three months of completing your leukaemia treatment. 
This will increase the risk of severe infections. </li>
<li>vincristine, another cancer medicine. If used at the same time as Oncaspar there is an increased 
risk of side effects or allergic reactions. </li>
<li>medicines which reduce the blood s ability to clot such as anticoagulants (e.g., 
coumarin/warfarin and heparin), dipyridamol, acetylsalicylic acid or non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen or naproxen). If used at the same time as 
Oncaspar, there is a higher risk of bleeding disorders. </li>
<li>medicines which require cell division for their effect, for example, methotrexate (a medicine 
used for cancer as well as arthritis treatment) may have a decrease in its effect. </li>
<li>prednisone, a steroid medicine. If used at the same time as Oncaspar, the effects on the clotting 
ability of your blood are increased. </li>
<li>Glucocorticoids when taken at the same time as part of recommended leukamia treatment, 
Oncaspar may increase the risk of steroid-induced osteonecrosis (bone damage) in children and 
adolescents, with a higher incidence seen in girls. Therefore, if you experience any new bone 
pain (i.e. pain in hip, knee or back), please inform your doctor as soon as possible. </li>
<li>cytarabine, a medicine which can be used in cancer treatment, and could interfere with the 
effects of Oncaspar. </li>
</ul>
<p>Oncaspar can also cause changes in liver function which can affect the way other medicines work. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not use Oncaspar if you are pregnant because its effects during pregnancy have not been 
studied. Your physician will decide whether your disease requires treatment. Women who are able to 
get pregnant must use reliable contraception during treatment, and for at least 6 months after Oncaspar 
treatment has been discontinued. Oral contraception is not an effective method of contraception while 
on treatment with Oncaspar. Ask your doctor for advice on the best contraceptive method that you can 
use. Men must also use effective contraception while they or their partners are being treated with 
Oncaspar. </p>
<p>It is not known whether pegaspargase is excreted inbreast milk. As a precautionary measure, 
breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Oncaspar and should not be re-started 
until after treatment with Oncaspar has been discontinued. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines when using this medicine because it may make you feel drowsy, tired or 
confused. </p>
<p>Oncaspar contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
