  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is and how it works </p>
<p>ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance irinotecan. 
This active substance is held in tiny lipid (fatty) particles called liposomes. </p>
<p>Irinotecan belongs to a group of cancer medicines called  topoisomerase inhibitors . It blocks an 
enzyme called topoisomerase I, which is involved in the division of cell DNA. This prevents the 
cancer cells from multiplying and growing, and they eventually die. </p>
<p>The liposomes are expected to accumulate within the tumour and release the medicine slowly over 
time, thereby allowing it to act for longer. </p>
<p>What ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used for </p>
<p>ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used to treat adult patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer 
(cancer of the pancreas that has already spread elsewhere in the body) whose previously cancer 
treatment included a medicine called gemcitabine. ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used in 
combination with other cancer medicines, called 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal works or why this medicine has 
been prescribed for you, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

information contained in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Do not use ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a history of a severe allergy to irinotecan, or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
<li>if you are breast-feeding. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal 
- if you have ever had any liver problems or jaundice 
- if you have ever had lung disease or have previously received medicines (colony stimulating 
factors) to increase your blood count or radiation therapy 
- if you are taking other medicines (see section  Other medicines and ONIVYDE pegylated 
liposomal ) 
- if you are planning to have a vaccination as many vaccinations must not be given during 
chemotherapy 
- if you are on a controlled sodium diet as this medicine contains sodium. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse immediately during treatment with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal 
- if you feel sudden shortness of breath, flushing, headache, skin rash or hives (itchy rash with 
swollen red bumps on the skin that appear suddenly), itching, swelling around the eyes, 
tightness in the chest or throat during or shortly after your infusion 
- if you experience fever, chills or other symptoms of infection 
- if you get diarrhoea with frequent liquid stools and cannot control this after 12 to 24 hours of 
treatment (see below) 
- if you get breathlessness or cough.<br />
- if you experience signs or symptoms of a blood clot, like sudden pain and swelling in a leg or an 
arm, sudden onset of coughing, chest pain or difficulty breathing. </p>
<p>What to do in case of diarrhoea </p>
<p>As soon as the first liquid stool occurs, start drinking large volumes of rehydration fluids ( .g. water, 
soda water, fizzy drinks, soup) to avoid losing too much liquid and salts from your body. Contact your 
doctor immediately to give you a suitable treatment. Your doctor may give you a medicine which 
contains loperamide to begin treatment at home but it must not be used for longer than 48 consecutive 
hours. If loose stools persist, contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Blood tests and medical examinations </p>
<p>Before you start treatment with ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal, your doctor will perform blood tests 
(or other medical examinations) to determine the best starting dose for you. You will need to have 
further (blood or other) tests during treatment so that your doctor can monitor your blood cells and 
assess how you are responding to the treatment. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose or  your 
treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age 
of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
It is especially important that you tell your doctor if you have been given irinotecan in any form 
earlier. 
ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal must not be used instead of other medicines containing irinotecan 
because it behaves differently when it is contained in the liposomes than when it is given in its free 
form. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are already having, or have recently had chemotherapy 
and/or radiotherapy or treatment with the antifungal medicine flucytosine. </p>
<p>It is also especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking the following medicines, 
since they reduce the level of irinotecan in your body:</p>
<ul>
<li>phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine (medicines used to treat convulsions and falls) </li>
<li>rifampicin and rifabutin (medicines used to treat tuberculosis) </li>
<li>St. John s wort (a plant-based medicine used to treat depression and low mood) </li>
</ul>
<p>It is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking the following medicines, since 
they increase the level of irinotecan in your body:</p>
<ul>
<li>ketoconazole, itraconazole or voriconazole (medicines used to treat fungal infections) </li>
<li>clarithromycin (an antibiotic medicine used to treat bacterial infections) </li>
<li>indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, atazanavir (medicines against HIV 
infection)  </li>
<li>regorafenib (a medicine against certain forms of cancer) </li>
<li>telaprevir (a medicine used to treat a liver disease called hepatitis C) </li>
<li>nefazodone (a medicine used to treat depression, low mood) </li>
<li>gemfibrozil (medicine used to treat high fat levels in the blood) </li>
</ul>
<p>ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal with food and drink </p>
<p>Avoid eating grapefruits and drinking grapefruit juice while you are receiving ONIVYDE pegylated 
liposomal as it may increase the level of irinotecan in your body. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>You should not be given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal if you are pregnant as it may harm the baby. 
Tell your doctor if you are or think you may be pregnant. Ask your doctor for advice if you are 
planning to have a baby. If you are given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal you should not breast-feed 
until one month after the last dose. </p>
<p>Prior to taking this medicine talk with your doctor about the possible risk with this medicine and the 
options that may preserve your ability to have children. </p>
<p>During your ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment and for seven months after you should choose 
an effective birth control method which suits you to prevent pregnancy in this period of time. Males 
should use condoms during ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment and for 4 months thereafter. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You must not be given ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal if 
you are breast-feeding as this may be harmful to your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal may influence your ability to drive and use machines (as you may be 
sleepy, dizzy and exhausted with the use of ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal). You should avoid 
driving, using machines or performing other tasks that need full attention if you feel sleepy, dizzy and 
exhausted. </p>
<p>ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 33,1 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 1,65% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""
