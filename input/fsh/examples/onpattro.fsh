<p>Onpattro is a medicine that treats an illness which runs in families called hereditary 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis). </p>
<p>hATTR amyloidosis is caused by problems with a protein in the body called  transthyretin  (TTR). 
* This protein is made mostly in the liver and carries vitamin A and other substances around the 
body. 
* In people with this illness, abnormally shaped TTR proteins clump together to make deposits 
called  amyloid . 
* Amyloid can build up around the nerves, heart, and other places in the body, preventing them 
from working normally. This causes the symptoms of the illness. </p>
<p>Onpattro works by lowering the amount of TTR protein that the liver makes. 
* This means there is less TTR protein in the blood that can form amyloid. 
* This can help to reduce the effects of this illness. </p>
<p>Onpattro is used in adults only. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to patisiran, or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
Onpattro. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Infusion-related reactions </p>
<p>Onpattro is given as a drip into a vein (called an  intravenous infusion ). Reactions to this infusion 
may happen during treatment with Onpattro. Before each infusion you will be given medicines that 
help to lower the chance of infusion-related reactions (see  Medicines given during treatment with 
Onpattro  in section 3). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any signs of an infusion-related reaction. These signs 
are listed at the beginning of section 4. If you have an infusion-related reaction, your doctor or nurse may slow down or stop your infusion, 
and you may need to take other medicines to control the symptoms. When these reactions stop, or get 
better, your doctor or nurse may decide to start the infusion again. </p>
<p>Vitamin A deficiency </p>
<p>Treatment with Onpattro lowers the amount of vitamin A in your blood. Your doctor will measure 
your vitamin A levels. If your vitamin A levels are low, your doctor will wait until your vitamin A 
levels have returned to normal and any symptoms due to vitamin A deficiency have resolved before 
you start treatment with Onpattro.. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency may include: 
* Decrease in night vision, dry eyes, poor vision, hazy or cloudy vision </p>
<p>If you have problems with your vision or any other eye problems whilst using Onpattro, you should 
talk to your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist for a check-up if it is necessary. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to take a daily vitamin A supplement during treatment with Onpattro. </p>
<p>Both too high and too low levels of vitamin A can harm the development of your unborn child. 
Therefore, women of child-bearing age should not be pregnant when starting treatment with Onpattro 
and should practise effective contraception (see section  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception<br />
below). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking 
Onpattro. Your doctor will ensure that your vitamin A levels have returned to normal before you try to 
become pregnant. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have an unplanned pregnancy. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking 
Onpattro. During the first 3 months of your pregnancy, your doctor may tell you to stop your vitamin 
A supplement. During the last 6 months of your pregnancy you should resume vitamin A 
supplementation if the vitamin A levels in your blood have not yet returned to normal, because of an 
increased risk of vitamin A deficiency during the last 3 months of your pregnancy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Onpattro is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Onpattro </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
important to tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines as your doctor 
may need to change the dose: 
* Bupropion, a medicine used to treat depression or to help you to stop smoking 
* Efavirenz, a medicine used to treat HIV infection and AIDS </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before starting this medicine. </p>
<p>Women of child-bearing age </p>
<p>Onpattro will reduce the level of vitamin A in your blood, which is important for normal development 
of your unborn child. If you are a woman of child-bearing age, you should practise effective 
contraception during treatment with Onpattro. Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of 
contraception. Pregnancy should be excluded before starting treatment with Onpattro. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>You should not use Onpattro if you are pregnant, unless advised by your doctor. If you are of child-
bearing age and intend to use Onpattro, you should practise effective contraception. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Ingredients of Onpattro may pass into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about stopping breast-feeding 
or treatment with Onpattro. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Onpattro is believed to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Your 
doctor will tell you whether your condition allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. </p>
<p>Onpattro contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 3.99 milligrams (mg) of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per 
millilitre (mL). This is 0.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. </p>         </div>"""
