<p>Ontozry is used in combination with other antiepileptic medicines in adult patients with epilepsy who 
have not been adequately controlled despite a history of treatment with at least 2 anti-epileptic 
products, to treat a type of epilepsy that has focal-onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation. Focal-onset seizures are those caused by abnormal brain activity starting in a part of the 
brain on one side, and secondary generalisation means that that the abnormal activity is spreading to 
both sides of the brain. The medicine can be used only in adults.  </p>         </div>"""

Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisation(s) </p>
<p>Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cenobamate, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:<br />
In view of available data from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including 11 Individual Case 
Safety Reports with a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between cenobamate and  suicidal ideation  is at least a reasonable possibility. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing cenobamate should be 
amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall 
conclusions and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cenobamate the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cenobamate is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. </p>         </div>"""
