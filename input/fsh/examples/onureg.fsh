Onureg is an anti-cancer medicine that belongs to a group of medicines called anti-metabolites. 
Onureg contains the active substance azacitidine. </p>
<p>What Onureg is used for<br />
Onureg is used to treat adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This is a form of cancer which 
affects your bone marrow and can cause problems with producing normal blood cells. </p>
<p>Onureg is used to keep the disease in control (remission, when the disease is less severe or not active). </p>
<p>How Onureg works 
Onureg works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine, the active substance in Onureg, 
works by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off. It also reduces the production of new genetic 
material (RNA and DNA). These effects are thought to block growth of cancer cells in leukaemia. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Onureg works or why this medicine 
has been prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""
