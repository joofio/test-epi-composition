* advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older 
* melanoma after complete resection in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older 
(treatment after surgery is called adjuvant therapy) 
* advanced non-small cell lung cancer (a type of lung cancer) in adults 
* non-small cell lung cancer (a type of lung cancer) prior to resection in adults (treatment prior to 
surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy) 
* malignant pleural mesothelioma (a type of cancer that affects the lining of the lung) in adults 
* advanced renal cell carcinoma (advanced kidney cancer) in adults 
* classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after or has not responded to previous 
therapies, including an autologous stem-cell transplant (a transplant of your own 
blood-producing cells) in adults

<p>It contains the active substance nivolumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed 
to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body. </p>
<p>Nivolumab attaches to a target protein called programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) that can switch off 
the activity of T cells (a type of white blood cell that forms part of the immune system, the body s 
natural defences). By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action and prevents it from switching 
off your T cells. This helps increase their activity against the melanoma, lung, kidney, lymphoid, head 
and neck, bladder, colon, rectal, stomach, oesophageal or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer cells. </p>
<p>OPDIVO may be given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines. It is important that you also 
read the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, 
please ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to nivolumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6 "Contents of the pack and other information"). Talk to your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using OPDIVO as it may cause: 
* Problems with your heart such as a change in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat or an 
abnormal heart rhythm. 
* Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of 
inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). 
* Diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or any symptoms of inflammation of the intestines 
(colitis), such as stomach pain and mucus or blood in stool. 
* Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). Signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include abnormal 
liver function tests, eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach 
area, or tiredness. 
* Inflammation or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal 
kidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine. 
* Problems with your hormone producing glands (including the pituitary, the thyroid, the 
parathyroid and adrenal glands) that may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms 
that these glands are not working properly may include fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight 
change or headache, decreased blood levels of calcium and visual disturbances. 
* Diabetes including a serious, sometimes life-threatening problem due to acid in the blood 
produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis). Symptoms may include feeling more hungry or 
thirsty than usual, need to urinate more often, weight loss, feeling tired or having difficulty 
thinking clearly, breath that smells sweet or fruity, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a 
different odour to your urine or sweat, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, and deep or fast 
breathing. 
* Inflammation of the skin that can lead to severe skin reaction (known as toxic epidermal 
necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Signs and symptoms of severe skin reaction may 
include rash, itching, and peeling of the skin (possibly fatal). 
* Inflammation of the muscles such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), myositis 
(inflammation of the muscles) and rhabdomyolysis (stiffness in muscles and joints, muscle 
spasm). Signs and symptoms may include muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, chest pain, or 
severe fatigue. 
* Solid organ transplant rejection. 
* Graft-versus-host disease. 
* Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A rare disease in which our immune system makes 
too many of otherwise normal infection fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. 
Symptoms may include enlarged liver and/or spleen, skin rash, lymph node enlargement, 
breathing problems, easy bruising, kidney abnormalities, and heart problems. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or if they get worse. Do 
not try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. Your doctor may 
* give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, 
* withhold the next dose of OPDIVO, 
* or stop your treatment with OPDIVO altogether. 
Please note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed, and may develop weeks or months 
after your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have 
blood tests during your treatment. 
Check with your doctor or nurse before you are given OPDIVO if: 
* you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); 
* you have melanoma of the eye; 
* you were previously given ipilimumab, another medicine for treating melanoma, and 
experienced serious side effects because of that medicine; 
* you have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain; 
* you have any history of inflammation of the lungs; 
* you have been taken medicines to suppress your immune system. </p>
<p>Complications of stem cell transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic) after treatment with 
OPDIVO. These complications can be severe and can lead to death. Your healthcare provider will 
monitor you for signs of complications if you have an allogeneic stem cell transplant. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
OPDIVO should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age except for adolescents 
12 years of age and older with melanoma. </p>
<p>Other medicines and OPDIVO 
Before you are given OPDIVO, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that suppress your 
immune system, such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
OPDIVO. However, once you are treated with OPDIVO, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to 
reduce any possible side effects that you may have during your treatment and this will not impact the 
effect of the medicine. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. Do not take any other 
medicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you might be, if you are planning to become pregnant, 
or if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Do not use OPDIVO if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically tells you to. The effects of 
OPDIVO in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substance, nivolumab, 
could harm an unborn baby. 
* You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with OPDIVO and for at 
least 5 months following the last dose of OPDIVO, if you are a woman who could become 
pregnant. 
* If you become pregnant while using OPDIVO tell your doctor. </p>
<p>It is not known whether OPDIVO gets into breast milk. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be 
excluded. Ask your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with OPDIVO. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
OPDIVO or OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab may have a minor influence on the ability to 
drive and use machines; however, use caution when performing these activities until you are sure that 
OPDIVO does not adversely affect you. </p>
<p>OPDIVO contains sodium 
Tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given OPDIVO. This 
medicine contains 2.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each mL of concentrate. 
OPDIVO contains 10 mg sodium per 4 mL vial, 25 mg sodium per 10 mL vial, 30 mg sodium per 
12 mL vial or 60 mg sodium per 24 mL vial, which is equivalent to 0.5%, 1.25%, 1.5% or 3% 
respectively, of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>You will also find key messages from this package leaflet in the patient alert card you have been given 
by your doctor. It is important that you keep this patient alert card and show it to your partner or 
caregivers. </p>         </div>"""
