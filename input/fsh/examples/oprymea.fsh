Oprymea is used to:
-
treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson's disease in adults. It can be used alone or in 
combination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson s disease).
-
treat the symptoms of moderate to severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome in adults.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Oprymea. Tell your doctor if you have or have had or develop any 
medical conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following:
-
Kidney disease
-
Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are 
visual
-
Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced 
Parkinson s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the 
up-titration of Oprymea
-
Dystonia (inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia)). In
particular, you may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), 
forward bending of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back 
(also called pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to change 
your medication. 
-
Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep
-
Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia)
-
Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with Oprymea
-
Severe heart or blood vessels disease. You will need to have your blood pressure checked 
regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall 
in blood pressure on standing up).
-
Augmentation. You may experience that symptoms start earlier than usual, be more intense and 
involve other limbs.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to 
behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry 
out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and 
can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high 
sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to 
adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling 
elated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion or loss of reality). Your doctor 
may need to adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or 
pain after stopping or reducing your Oprymea treatment. If the problems persist more than a few 
weeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.
Children and adolescents
Oprymea is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and Oprymea
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have 
obtained without a prescription.
You should avoid taking Oprymea together with antipsychotic medicines.
Take care if you are taking the following medicines:
-
cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers)
-
amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson s disease)
-
mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia)
-
zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a 
disease of the human immune system)
-
cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers)
-
quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the 
treatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria))
-
procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat)
If you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start 
treatment with Oprymea.
Take care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are
drinking alcohol. In these cases Oprymea may affect your ability to drive and operate machinery.
Oprymea with food, drink and alcohol
You should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with Oprymea.
Oprymea can be taken with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with 
you if you should continue to take Oprymea.
The effect of Oprymea on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take Oprymea if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding. Oprymea can reduce the production of breast milk. 
Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of Oprymea is unavoidable, 
breast-feeding should be stopped.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Oprymea can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If affected, do 
not drive or use machines.
Oprymea has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate 
machinery. Please tell your doctor if this occurs.</p>         </div>"""

If you stop taking your tablets for more than a few days and want to restart the treatment, you must 
start again at the lowest dose. You can then build up the dose again, as you did the first time. Ask your 
doctor for advice.
Your doctor will review your treatment after 3 months to decide whether or not to continue the 
treatment.
Patients with kidney disease
If you have severe kidney disease, Oprymea may not be a suitable treatment for you.
If you take more Oprymea than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets:
-
Contact your doctor or nearest hospital casualty department immediately for advice.
-
You may experience vomiting, restlessness, or any of the side effects as described in section 4. "Possible side effects".
If you forget to take Oprymea
Do not worry. Simply leave out that dose completely and then take your next dose at the right time.
Do not try to make up for the missed dose.
If you stop taking Oprymea
Do not stop taking Oprymea without first talking to your doctor. If you have to stop taking this 
medicine, your doctor will reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of worsening symptoms.
If you suffer from Parkinson s disease you should not stop treatment with Oprymea abruptly. A 
sudden stop could cause you to develop a medical condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
which may represent a major health risk. The symptoms include:
-
akinesia (loss of muscle movement)
-
rigid muscles
-
fever
-
unstable blood pressure
-
tachycardia (increased heart rate)
-
confusion
-
depressed level of consciousness (e.g. coma).
If you stop or reduce Oprymea you may also develop a medical condition called dopamine agonist 
withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms include depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. If 
you experience these symptoms you should contact your physician.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
