 endothelin receptor antagonists .
Opsumit is used for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults; it can 
be used on its own or with other medicines for PAH. PAH is high blood pressure in the blood vessels 
that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary arteries). In people with PAH, these 
arteries get narrower, so the heart has to work harder to pump blood through them. This causes people 
to feel tired, dizzy, and short of breath.
Opsumit widens the pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. 
This lowers the blood pressure, relieves the symptoms and improves the course of the disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are pregnant, if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you could become pregnant

<p>if you are breastfeeding. See section  Pregnancy and breastfeeding .</p>
<p>if you have liver disease or if you have very high levels of liver enzymes in your blood. Talk to 
your doctor, who will decide whether this medicine is suitable for you.
If any of these apply to you, please tell your doctor.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Opsumit.
You will need blood tests, as indicated by your doctor:
Your doctor will take blood test before you start treatment with Opsumit and during treatment to test:</p>
<p>whether you have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells)</p>
<p>whether your liver is working properly
If you have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells), you may have the following signs:</p>
<p>dizziness </p>
<p>fatigue/malaise/weakness</p>
<p>fast heart rate, palpitations</p>
<p>pallor
If you notice any of these signs, tell your doctor.
Signs that your liver may not be working properly include:</p>
<p>feeling sick (nausea)</p>
<p>vomiting</p>
<p>fever </p>
<p>pain in your stomach (abdomen)</p>
<p>yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice)</p>
<p>dark-coloured urine</p>
<p>itching of your skin</p>
<p>unusual tiredness or exhaustion (lethargy or fatigue)</p>
<p>flu-like syndrome (joint and muscle pain with fever)
If you notice any of these signs, tell your doctor immediately.
If you have kidney problems, talk to your doctor before using Opsumit. Macitentan may lead to more 
reduction of blood pressure and decrease in haemoglobin in patients with kidney problems.
In patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (obstruction of the lung veins), the use of 
medicines for treatment of PAH, including Opsumit, may lead to pulmonary oedema. If you have 
signs of pulmonary oedema when using Opsumit, such as a sudden, important increase in 
breathlessness and low oxygen, tell your doctor immediately. Your doctor may perform additional 
tests, and will determine what treatment regimen is most suitable for you.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years because Opsumit has not been 
tested in children.

case.

your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

<p>If it is possible you could become pregnant, use a reliable form of birth control (contraception) 
while you are taking Opsumit. Talk to your doctor about this.</p>
<p>Do not take Opsumit if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.</p>
<p>If you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant while you are taking Opsumit, or
