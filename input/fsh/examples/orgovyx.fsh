<p>Relugolix works by blocking a step in the process that signals the testes to produce testosterone (the 
male sex hormone). As testosterone can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer, by decreasing it to 
very low levels, relugolix prevents prostate cancer cells from growing and dividing.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Orgovyx if you have any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart circulation conditions such as heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia). The risk of heart 
rhythm problems may be increased when using Orgovyx. Your doctor may check your body 
salts (electrolytes) and the electrical activity of your heart during treatment with Orgovyx.  </li>
<li>Tell your doctor right away if you get any signs or symptoms like dizziness, fainting, feeling 
that your heart is pounding or racing (palpitations) or chest pain. Those can be symptoms of 
serious heart rhythm problems. </li>
<li>Liver disease. Liver function may need to be monitored. Use of Orgovyx has not been 
investigated in patients with severe liver disease. </li>
<li>Renal (kidney) disease. </li>
<li>Osteoporosis or any condition that affects the strength of your bones. Reduced levels of 
testosterone may lead to thinning of bones. </li>
<li>Monitoring of your disease with a blood test for prostatespecific antigen (PSA). </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Orgovyx is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Orgovyx 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Orgovyx may interfere with some medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, 
procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol) or might increase the risk of heart rhythm problems when used 
with some other drugs (e.g. methadone [used for pain relief and part of drug addiction detoxification], 
moxifloxacin [an antibiotic], antipsychotics used for serious mental illnesses).  </p>
<p>Other medicines may interfere with the absorption of relugolix, resulting in either an increase in blood 
levels that may increase side effects or decrease in blood levels that may decrease the effectiveness of 
Orgovyx. Examples of medicines that may interfere with Orgovyx include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat epilepsy (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat bacterial infections (e.g. rifampicin, azithromycin, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline).  </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat prostate cancer (e.g. apalutamide). </li>
<li>Herbal remedies containing St John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum).   </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat high blood pressure (e.g. carvedilol, verapamil). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat arrhythmias (e.g. amiodarone, dronedarone, propafenone, 
quinidine). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat angina (e.g. ranolazine). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used as immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclosporine). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat HIV infections (e.g. ritonavir [or ritonavir-containing 
combinations], efavirenz). </li>
<li>Certain medicines used to treat hepatitis C (e.g. telaprevir). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may therefore change your medications, change when you take your certain medications, 
the dose of the medicines, or increase the dose of Orgovyx. </p>
