angioedema attacks in adults, and adolescents aged from 12 years with hereditary angioedema.  </p>
<p>What hereditary angioedema is </p>
<p>Hereditary angioedema is a condition that often runs in families. It can limit your daily activity by 
causing attacks of swelling and pain in different parts of your body including: 
* hands and feet 
* face, eyelids, lips or tongue 
* voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult 
* genitals 
* stomach and intestines </p>
<p>How Orladeyo works </p>
<p>In hereditary angioedema your blood does not have enough of a protein called C1 inhibitor, or the 
protein does not work properly. This leads to too much of the enzyme plasma kallikrein, which in turn 
increases the levels of bradykinin in your bloodstream. Too much bradykinin leads to symptoms of 
hereditary angioedema. Berotralstat, the active substance in Orladeyo, blocks the activity of plasma 
kallikrein and so reduces bradykinin. This prevents the swelling and pain that hereditary angioedema 
can cause. </p>         </div>"""
