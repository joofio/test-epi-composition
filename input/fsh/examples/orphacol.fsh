<p>Warnings and precautions 
During your treatment, your doctor will carry out various blood and urine tests at different time to see how 
your body is handling this medicine and to help work out the dose that you need. More frequent tests will 
be needed if you are growing fast, if you are ill (if you have e.g. liver problems), or if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Orphacol 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken any or might take other medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines used to lower cholesterol levels, so-called bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, 
colestipol, colesevelam), and medicines to treat heartburn that contain aluminium may lessen the effect of 
Orphacol. If you take these medicines, take Orphacol at least 5 hours before or at least 5 hours after taking 
these other medicines.<br />
Ciclosporin (a medicine used to suppress the immune system) may also change the effect of Orphacol. 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking ciclosporin. 
Ursodeoxycholic acid may lessen the effect Orphacol if both medicines are taken at the same time. 
If you are prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid along with Orphacol in single doses, take one product in the 
morning and the other product in the evening. If you are prescribed divided doses of ursodeoxycholic acid 
and/or Orphacol, as these products should be administered separately by several hours, please ask for the 
advice of your doctor or pharmacist about proper sequence of administration. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Please consult your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. Take a pregnancy test as soon as you suspect 
you may be pregnant. It is very important to continue taking Orphacol during pregnancy. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant during treatment with Orphacol, your doctor will decide which treatment and dose 
is best in your situation. As a precaution, you and your unborn child should be closely monitored during 
pregnancy. </p>
<p>Orphacol can be used during breast-feeding. Tell your doctor if you plan to breast-feed or are breast-
feeding before you take Orphacol. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Orphacol is not expected to have an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Orphacol contains lactose 
Orphacol contains a certain sugar (lactose monohydrate). If you have been told by your doctor that you 
have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking Orphacol. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take Orphacol exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The usual starting dose is 5 to 15 mg per kilogram body weight every day in infants, children, adolescents 
and adults. </p>
<p>Before treatment your doctor will make an assessment from your laboratory tests to determine the correct 
dose for you. The dose will then be further adjusted by your doctor depending on your body s response.  </p>
<p>Orphacol capsules are taken by mouth with a meal at approximately the same time each day, in the 
morning and/or evening. Taking Orphacol at regular times with a meal will help you remember to take 
this medicine, and may help your body to better take it up. Capsules must be swallowed whole with water. 
Do not chew. </p>
<p>If your doctor has prescribed a dose which requires you to take more than one capsule per day, you and 
your doctor can decide how this will be taken during the day. You may for example take one capsule in 
the morning and one in the evening. This way, you will have to take fewer capsules at once. However, this 
might not be possible if you have been prescribed at the same time another medicine containing 
ursodeoxycholic acid. In this case, you should seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist about proper 
sequence of administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and Orphacol over the day, as these products should 
be administered separately by several hours (see section 2). 
Use in children 
For babies and children who cannot swallow capsules, the capsule can be opened and its contents added to 
baby formula or apple/orange or apple/apricot juice adapted for small children. </p>
<p>If you take more Orphacol than you should 
If you have taken more Orphacol than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible. He will assess 
your laboratory test results and advise you when you should resume your treatment with your normal 
dose. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Orphacol 
Take your next dose when you would normally take it. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Orphacol 
There is a risk of permanently damaging your liver if you stop taking Orphacol. You should never stop 
taking Orphacol unless your doctor advises you to do so. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
