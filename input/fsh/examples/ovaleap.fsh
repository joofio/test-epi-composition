  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Ovaleap is 
This medicine contains the active substance follitropin alfa, which is almost identical to a natural 
hormone produced by your body called  follicle-stimulating hormone  (FSH). FSH is a gonadotropin, 
a type of hormone that plays an important role in human fertility and reproduction. In women, FSH is 
needed for the growth and development of the sacs (follicles) in the ovaries that contain the egg cells. 
In men, FSH is needed for the production of sperm. </p>
<p>What Ovaleap is used for </p>
<p>In adult women, Ovaleap is used: 
* to help ovulation (release of a mature egg cell from the follicle) in women that cannot ovulate 
and that have not responded to treatment with a medicine called  clomifene citrate . 
* to help follicles develop in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures 
(procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as  in vitro fertilisation ,  gamete 
intra-fallopian transfer  or  zygote intra-fallopian transfer . 
* in combination with a medicine called  lutropin alfa  (a version of another gonadotropin, 
 luteinising hormone  or LH) to help ovulation in women whose body is producing too little 
FSH and LH. </p>
<p>In adult men, Ovaleap is used: 
* in combination with a medicine called  human chorionic gonadotropin  (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to low levels of certain hormones. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Ovaleap: 
* if you are allergic to follitropin alfa, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (parts of the brain). 
* if you are a woman with:</p>
<ul>
<li>large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. </li>
<li>unexplained vaginal bleeding. </li>
<li>cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. </li>
<li>any condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), fibroid tumours of the womb or malformed reproductive organs. </li>
<li>
<p>if you are a man with:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testicular failure that is not treatable. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before the treatment is started you and your partner s fertility should be evaluated by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ovaleap. </p>
<p>Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria. This 
is a condition that may be passed on from parents to children which means that you have an inability 
to break down porphyrins (organic compounds). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
* your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
* you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
If you experience the above symptoms your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor straight away if: 
* you get pain in the lower part of the abdomen (belly), 
* you gain any weight rapidly, 
* you feel sick or are vomiting, 
* you have difficulty in breathing. 
If you experience the above symptoms your doctor might ask you to stop using this medicine (see also 
section 4 under  Serious side effects in women"). </p>
<p>If you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and timing are followed, the occurrence of 
OHSS is less likely. Ovaleap treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used 
for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is given. If you are 
developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle. You may be told not 
to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least 4 days. </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy 
When using this medicine, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child (i.e. 
 multiple pregnancy , typically twins) than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead 
to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by 
using the right dose of this medicine at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and number of 
fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. </p>
<p>Miscarriage 
You are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman when undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs. </p>
<p>Ectopic pregnancy 
You are more likely to have a pregnancy outside the womb (an ectopic pregnancy) than the average 
woman when undergoing assisted reproductive technology and if you have damaged fallopian tubes. </p>
<p>Birth defects 
When being conceived by assisted reproductive technology, a baby may have a slightly higher risk of 
birth defects  than after natural conception. This could be related to multiple pregnancies or to parent 
characteristics such as maternal age and sperm characteristics. </p>
<p>Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
If you have ever had blood clots in your leg or lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if your family have 
experienced these, inform your doctor. You might have a higher risk of these problems occurring or 
becoming worse with Ovaleap treatment. </p>
<p>Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much natural FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. This 
medicine usually does not work if you have this problem. If your doctor decides to try Ovaleap 
treatment, they may monitor it by asking you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting 
treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ovaleap 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
* If you use Ovaleap with other medicines which help ovulation such as human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) or clomifene citrate, this may increase the response of your follicles. 
* If you use Ovaleap at the same time as a  gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (GnRH) agonist or 
antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of Ovaleap to produce follicles. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Ovaleap contains sodium, benzalkonium chloride and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>
<p>This medicine also contains 0.02 mg per mL of benzalkonium chloride and 10.0 mg per mL of benzyl 
alcohol. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease, and if you are 
pregnant or breast-feeding. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body 
and may cause side effects (called  metabolic acidosis ). </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>This medicine is given as an injection into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Your 
doctor or nurse will show you how to inject the medicine. If you administer this medicine to yourself, 
please carefully read and follow the  Instructions for Use  of the pen.<br />
What the recommended dose is 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU). </p>
<p>Women </p>
<p>If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods 
* This medicine is usually given every day. 
* If you have irregular periods, start using this medicine within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods, you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
* The usual starting dose of this medicine is 75 to 150 IU each day. 
* Your dose of this medicine may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until 
you get the desired response. 
* The maximum daily dose of this medicine is usually not higher than 225 IU. 
* When you get the desired response, you will be given hCG or  recombinant hCG  (r-hCG, an 
hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique). The single injection will be 
250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last Ovaleap 
injection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb 
cavity. </p>
<p>If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with Ovaleap should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of this 
medicine than before. </p>
<p>If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
[see also section 2 under  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ]. For the following cycle, 
your doctor will give you a lower dose of Ovaleap than before. </p>
<p>If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
* The usual starting dose of this medicine is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
menstrual cycle. 
* The dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 450 IU. 
* Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
* When your eggs are ready, you will be given hCG or r-hCG. The single injection will be 
250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last Ovaleap 
injection. This gets your eggs ready for collection. </p>
<p>In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then Ovaleap is given approximately 2 weeks after the start 
of agonist treatment. The Ovaleap and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. </p>
<p>If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
* The usual starting dose of Ovaleap is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. 
* You will use these two medicines each day for up to 5 weeks. 
* Your dose of Ovaleap may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get 
the desired response. 
* When you get the desired response, you will be given hCG or r-hCG. The single injection will 
be 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last 
injections of Ovaleap and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG 
injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted 
reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor s judgment. </p>
<p>If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle should be stopped. For the 
following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of this medicine than before. </p>
<p>If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with Ovaleap will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG [see also section 2 under  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ]. For the 
following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of Ovaleap than before. </p>
<p>Men 
* The usual dose of this medicine is 150 IU together with hCG. 
* You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
* If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. </p>
<p>How are the injections given? 
This medicine is given as an injection into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection) using 
the Ovaleap Pen. The Ovaleap Pen is a device (a  pen ) used for giving injections into the tissue just 
under the skin. </p>
<p>Your doctor may suggest that you learn how to inject yourself with this medicine. Your doctor or 
nurse will give you instructions on how to do this and you can also find instructions in the separate 
instructions for use of the pen. Do not attempt to self-administer this medicine without this training by 
your doctor or nurse. The very first injection of this medicine should only be given in the presence of a 
doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>Ovaleap solution for injection in cartridges has been developed for use in the Ovaleap Pen. You must 
follow the separate instructions for use of the Ovaleap Pen carefully. The instructions for use of the 
pen will be provided together with the Ovaleap Pen. Proper treatment of your condition, however, 
requires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. </p>
<p>Discard used needles immediately after injection. </p>
<p>If you use more Ovaleap than you should 
The effects of using too much Ovaleap are unknown. Nevertheless one could expect ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4 under  Serious side 
effects in women". However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered [see also section 2 
under  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ]. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Ovaleap 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you 
realise that you forgot a dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Important side effects </p>
<p>Serious side effects in men and women 
* Allergic reactions such as skin rash, raised itchy areas of skin and severe allergic reactions with 
weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing and swelling of the face have been 
reported very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). If you think you are having this type 
of reaction, you must stop your Ovaleap injection and get medical help immediately. </p>
<p>Serious side effects in women 
* Lower stomach ache together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed [see also section 2 under  Ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ]. This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 
10 people). 
* OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight 
gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This 
side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
* Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
* Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events), sometimes independent of 
OHSS, may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest 
pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack [see also section 2 under  Blood clotting problems 
(thromboembolic events) ]. 
If you notice any of the above-listed side effects you should immediately contact your doctor who may 
ask you to stop using Ovaleap. </p>
