<p>Ozawade is used in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea to treat excessive daytime sleepiness. It is 
used when sleepiness occurs despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or in 
patients who have not tolerated CPAP. </p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition that causes you to stop breathing for at least 10 seconds 
during sleep. This can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and a tendency to suddenly fall asleep in 
inappropriate situations (sleep attacks). </p>
<p>The active substance, pitolisant, works on receptors (targets) on cells in the brain that are involved in 
stimulating alertness. This effect helps to reduce daytime sleepiness and tiredness. </p>         </div>"""

<li>You have heart problems. Your doctor will need to check this regularly while you are taking

</ul>

ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>You should not take Ozawade during pregnancy unless you and your doctor decide that you need to 
take it. There is not enough information on the risk of taking Ozawade during pregnancy. If you are a 
woman, you have to use effective birth control during your treatment with Ozawade and for at least days after stopping treatment. As Ozawade may reduce the effectiveness of a hormonal contraceptive 
(birth control medicine), an alternative method of effective contraception has to be used. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>You must stop breastfeeding when you start taking Ozawade. Ozawade passes into milk in animals. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You may feel sleepy or your ability to concentrate may be impaired. Take care with activities that 
require attention such as driving a car and handling machinery. Talk to your doctor or your pharmacist
