<p>Ozempic is used to treat adults (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise 
is not enough: 
* on its own   when you cannot use metformin (another diabetes medicine) or 
* with other medicines for diabetes   when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels.

section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine is not the same as insulin and you should not use it if: 
* you have type 1 diabetes   a condition where your body does not produce any insulin 
* you develop diabetic ketoacidosis   a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, breathing 
difficulty, confusion, excessive thirst, a sweet smell to the breath or a sweet or metallic taste in 
the mouth.  </p>
<p>Ozempic is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin.<br />
Effects on the digestive system  </p>
<p>During treatment with this medicine, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have 
diarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you drink 
plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney problems. Talk 
to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. </p>
<p>Severe and on-going stomach pain which could be due to acute pancreatitis </p>
<p>If you have severe and on-going pain in the stomach area   see a doctor straight away as this could be 
a sign of acute pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas). Please see section 4 for the warning signs of inflamed 
pancreas. </p>
<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) </p>
<p>Combining a sulfonylurea or an insulin with this medicine might increase the risk of getting low blood 
sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). Please see section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar levels. 
Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help your doctor decide if the dose 
of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low blood sugar. </p>
<p>Diabetic eye disease (retinopathy) </p>
<p>If you have diabetic eye disease and are using insulin, this medicine may lead to a worsening of your 
vision, and this may require treatment. Tell your doctor if you have diabetic eye disease or if you 
experience eye problems during treatment with this medicine. In case you have potentially unstable 
diabetic eye disease, it is not recommended that you use Ozempic 2 mg. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended in children and adolescents aged under 18 years as the safety and 
efficacy in this age group have not yet been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ozempic 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing any of the 
following: 
* Warfarin or other similar medicines taken by mouth to reduce blood clotting (oral anti-
coagulants). You may need frequent blood tests to check how quickly your blood clots. 
* If you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will 
recommend you to monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid hyperglycaemia 
(high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the 
body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine should not be used during pregnancy, as it is not known if it affects an unborn baby. 
Therefore, use of contraception is recommended while using this medicine. If you wish to become 
pregnant, discuss how to change your treatment with your doctor as you should stop using this 
medicine at least 2 months in advance. If you become pregnant while using this medicine, talk to your 
doctor right away, as your treatment will need to be changed. </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Ozempic is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. If you use this medicine in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may 
reduce your ability to concentrate. Do not drive or use machines if you get any signs of low blood 
sugar. See section 2,  Warnings and precautions  for information on increased risk of low blood sugar 
and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.  </p>
<p>Sodium content 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-

<p>If you forget to use Ozempic<br />
If you forgot to inject a dose and:

inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. 
* it is more than 5 days since you should have used Ozempic, skip the missed dose. Then inject 
your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Ozempic<br />
Do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor. If you stop using it, your blood sugar 
levels may increase. </p>
