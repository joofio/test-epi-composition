medicines called corticosteroids. 
OZURDEX is used to treat adult patients with:</p>
<p>Vision loss due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), if you have already had an operation for 
cataract, or if you have not previously responded to, or are not suitable for, other types of 
treatment.  Diabetic macular oedema is a swelling of the light-sensitive layer at the back of the 
eye called the macula.  DME is a condition that affects some people with diabetes. </p>
<p>Vision loss caused by a blockage of veins in the eye. This blockage leads to a build up of fluid 
causing swelling in the area of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) called 
the macula. 
Swelling of the macula may lead to damage which affects your central vision which is used for 
tasks like reading.  OZURDEX works by reducing this swelling of the macular which helps to 
lessen or prevent more damage to the macula.</p>
<p>Inflammation of the back of the eye. This inflammation leads to a decrease of vision and/or 
the presence of floaters in the eye, (black dots or wispy lines that move across the field of 
vision). OZURDEX works by reducing this inflammation.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to dexamethasone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
-
if you have an infection of any kind in or around your eye (bacterial, viral or fungal)
-
if you have glaucoma or high pressure inside your eye which is not controlled properly with the 
medicines you may be using
-
if the eye to be treated does not have a lens and the back of the lens capsule ( the bag ) has been 
ruptured
-
if the eye to be treated has undergone cataract surgery and has a man-made lens, which was 
implanted in the front compartment of the eye (anterior chamber intraocular lens) or was fixed 
to the white portion of the eye (sclera) or to the coloured part of the eye (iris), and the back of 
the lens capsule ( the bag ) has been ruptured
Warnings and precautions
Before your OZURDEX injection tell your doctor if:
-
You have had cataract surgery, iris surgery (the coloured part of the eye that controls the 
amount of light that enters into the eye) or surgery to remove the gel (called the vitreous) from 
within the eye
-
You are taking any medicines to thin the blood
-
You are taking any steroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines by mouth or applied to 
the eye
-
You have had a herpes simplex infection in your eye in the past (an ulcer on the eye that has 
been there a long time, or sores on the eye) 
Occasionally the injection of OZURDEX may cause an infection inside the eye, pain or redness in the 
eye, or a detachment or tear of the retina. It is important to identify and treat these as soon as possible. 
Please tell your doctor immediately if you develop increased eye pain or increased discomfort, 
worsening redness of your eye, flashing lights and sudden increase in floaters, partially blocked vision,
decreased vision or increased sensitivity to light after your injection.
In some patients the eye pressure may increase with the possible development of glaucoma. This is 
something you may not notice so your doctor will monitor you regularly and, if necessary provide 
treatment to lower the eye pressure.
In the majority of patients who have not yet had an operation for cataract, a clouding of the eye's 
natural lens (a cataract) may occur after repeated treatment with OZURDEX. If this occurs your vision 
will decrease, and you are likely to need an operation to remove the cataract. Your doctor will help 
you to decide when is the most appropriate time to perform this operation, but you should be aware 
that until you are ready for your operation your vision may be as bad or worse than it was before you 
started receiving your OZURDEX injections.
The implant can move from the back to the front of the eye in patients with a tear in the back of the 
lens capsule and/or those who have an opening in the iris. This can lead to swelling of the clear layer 
in the front of the eye and cause blurred vision.  If this continues for a long time and is left untreated, <br />
it may require tissue transplantation. 
The injection of OZURDEX into both eyes at the same time has not been studied and is not 
recommended. Your doctor should not inject OZURDEX into both eyes at the same time.
Children and adolescent (below 18 years of age)
The use of OZURDEX in children and adolescents has not been studied and is therefore not 
recommended.
Other medicines and OZURDEX
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines 
obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
There is no experience of using OZURDEX in pregnant women or during breast-feeding.  OZURDEX 
should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding unless your doctor thinks it is clearly necessary. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
discuss this with your doctor before OZURDEX treatment. Ask your doctor for advice before taking 
any medicine.
Driving and using machines
After OZURDEX treatment you may experience some reduced vision for a short time.  If this happens, 
do not drive or use any tools or machines until your vision improves. </p>         </div>"""

The recommended dose is one implant to be given by injection into your eye. If the effect of this

eye.
Your doctor will ask you to use antibiotic eye drops daily for 3 days before and after each injection to 
prevent any eye infection. Please follow these instructions carefully.
On the day of the injection, your doctor may use antibiotic eye drops to prevent infection. Before the 
injection, your doctor will clean your eye and eyelid. Your doctor will also give you a local anaesthetic 
to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection. You may hear a  click  during the 
injection of OZURDEX; this is normal.
Detailed instructions for your doctor on how to carry out the OZURDEX injection are provided 
in the medicine carton.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""
