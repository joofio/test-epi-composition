when: 
* The breast cancer has been identified to be of the  HER2-positive  form   your doctor will 
test you for this. 
* The cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver (metastasised) and 
has not previously been treated with anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) or other medicines 
designed to attach to HER2, or else the cancer has come back in the breast after previous 
treatment. 
* The cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and treatment is going to be given before 
surgery takes place (treatment before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy) 
* The cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and treatment is going to be given after 
surgery (treatment after surgery is called adjuvant therapy) </p>
<p>As well as Perjeta you will also receive trastuzumab and medicines called chemotherapy Information 
about these medicines is described in separate package leaflets. Ask your doctor or nurse to give you 
information about these other medicines. </p>
<p>How Perjeta works </p>
<p>Perjeta is a type of medicine called a  monoclonal antibody  which attaches itself to specific targets in 
your body and on the cancer cells.  </p>
<p>Perjeta recognises and attaches to a target called  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  (HER2). 
HER2 is found in large amounts on the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. 
When Perjeta attaches to the HER2 cancer cells, it may slow or stop the cancer cells from growing, or 
may kill them. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to pertuzumab, or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Perjeta. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Treatment with Perjeta may affect the heart.  Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Perjeta: 
* If you have ever had heart problems (such as heart failure, treatment for serious irregular 
heartbeats, uncontrolled high blood pressure, recent heart attack), your heart function will be 
checked before and during treatment with Perjeta and your doctor will run tests to check if 
your heart is working properly.<br />
* If you have ever had heart problems during previous treatment with trastuzumab. 
* If you have ever had a chemotherapy medicine from the class called anthracyclines, e.g. 
doxorubicin or epirubicin   these medicines can damage heart muscle and increase the risk of 
heart problems with Perjeta. </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are 
given Perjeta. See section 4  Serious side effects  for more details about signs of heart problems to 
look out for. </p>
<p>Infusion reactions 
Infusion reactions, allergic or anaphylactic (more severe allergic) reactions can happen. Your doctor or 
nurse will check for side effects during your infusion and for 30 to 60 minutes afterwards. If you get 
any serious reaction, your doctor may stop treatment with Perjeta. Very rarely, patients have died due 
to anaphylactic reactions during Perjeta infusion. See section 4  Serious side effects  for more details 
about infusion reactions to look out for during the infusion and thereafter.  </p>
<p>Febrile neutropenia (Low white blood cells with fever) 
When Perjeta is given with other cancer treatments (trastuzumab and chemotherapy), the number of 
white blood cells may drop and fever (raised temperature) may develop. If you have inflammation of 
the digestive tract (e.g.sore mouth or diarrhoea) you may be more likely to develop this side effect. </p>
<p>Diarrhoea 
Treatment with Perjeta may cause severe diarrhoea. Patients over 65 years of age have a higher risk of 
diarrhoea compared with patients younger than 65 years of age. Diarrhoea is a condition where your 
body produces more watery stools than normal. If you experience severe diarrhoea while receiving 
your anti-cancer treatment, your doctor may start you on anti-diarrhoeal treatment and may stop your 
treatment with Perjeta until the diarrhoea is under control.  </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Perjeta should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because there is no information on 
how it works in this age group. </p>
<p>Use in the elderly 
Patients over 65 years of age who are treated with Perjeta are more likely to experience side effects 
such as reduced appetite, decrease in the number of red blood cells, weight loss, feeling tired, loss or 
altered taste, weak, numb, tingling or prickling sensations mainly affecting the feet and legs and 
diarrhoea, compared to patients younger than 65 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Perjeta 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Before starting treatment, you must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if 
you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. They will advise you about the benefits 
and risks for you and your baby of taking Perjeta while you are pregnant. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor straight away, if you get pregnant during treatment with Perjeta or during the 
6 months after stopping treatment. </li>
<li>Ask your doctor about whether you can breast-feed during or after treatment with Perjeta. </li>
</ul>
<p>Perjeta may harm the unborn baby. You should use effective contraception during treatment with 
Perjeta and for 6 months after stopping treatment. Talk to your doctor about the best contraception for 
you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Perjeta may have a minor effect on you being able to drive or use machines. However, if you get any 
dizziness, infusion reactions, allergic or anaphylactic reactions, wait until these have gone away before 
driving or using machines. </p>
<p>Sodium<br />
Perjeta contains less than 1 mmol of sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially sodium-free. </p>         </div>"""
