Pifeltro is used to treat HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) infection. It belongs to a group of
medicines called  antiretroviral medicines .
Pifeltro contains the active substance doravirine - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
(NNRTI).
What Pifeltro is used for
Pifeltro is used to treat HIV infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at
least 35 kg. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ). You should
not take Pifeltro if your doctor has told you that the virus causing your infection is resistant to
doravirine.
Pifeltro must be used in combination with other medicines for HIV.
How Pifeltro works
When used with other medicines, Pifeltro works by preventing HIV from making more viruses in your
body. This will help by:
* reducing the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your  viral load )
* increasing the number of white blood cells called  CD4+ T . This can make your immune
system stronger. This may reduce your risk of early death or catching infections because your
immune system is weak.</p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to doravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in
section 6. * if you are taking the following medicines:
  carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines for seizures)
  rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines for tuberculosis)
  St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) or
products that contain it
  mitotane (a medicine to treat cancer)
  enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer)
  lumacaftor (a medicine to treat cystic fibrosis)
Do not take Pifeltro if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or
nurse before taking Pifeltro. See also  Other Medicines and Pifeltro  section.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Pifeltro.
Immune reactivation syndrome
This can happen when you start taking any HIV medicine, including this medicine. Your immune
system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long
time. Tell your doctor right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV
medicine.
Autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue)
may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune
disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection
or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up
towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor
immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg. The use
of Pifeltro in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg has not yet been studied.
Other medicines and Pifeltro
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. This is because other medicines may affect how Pifeltro works, and Pifeltro might affect
the way some other medicines work.
There are some medicines you must not take with Pifeltro. See list under  Do not take Pifeltro 
section.
Talk to your doctor before taking the following medicines with Pifeltro, as your doctor may need to
change the dose of your medicines:
* bosentan (a medicine to treat lung disease)
* dabrafenib (a medicine to treat skin cancer)
* lesinurad (a medicine to treat gout)
* modafinil (a medicine to treat excessive sleepiness)
* nafcillin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections)
* rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)
* telotristat ethyl (a medicine to treat diarrhoea in people with carcinoid syndrome)
* thioridazine (a medicine to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia)
If your doctor decides you should take these medicines with Pifeltro, one tablet of doravirine should be
taken twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).
Your doctor may check your blood levels or monitor for side effects if you take the following
medicines with Pifeltro:
* sirolimus (a medicine used to control your body s immune response after a transplant)
* tacrolimus (a medicine used to control your body s immune response after a transplant)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, talk
to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Pifeltro. It is preferable to avoid the use of this
medicine during pregnancy. This is because it has not been studied in pregnancy and it is not known if
it will harm your baby while you are pregnant.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Use caution when driving or riding a bicycle, or operating machines if you feel dizzy, tired, or sleepy
after taking this medicine.
Pifeltro tablets contain lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to lactose, talk to your doctor before
taking this medicine.</p>         </div>"""
