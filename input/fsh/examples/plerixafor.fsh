blood stem cells. This protein  ties  blood stem cells to the bone marrow. Plerixafor improves the 
release of stem cells into the blood stream (mobilisation). The stem cells can then be collected by a 
machine that separates blood constituents (apheresis machine), and subsequently frozen and stored 
until your transplant. </p>
<p>If mobilisation is poor, Plerixafor Accord is used to help collect blood stem cells from the patient, for 
collection, storage and reintroduction (transplantation), </p>
<p>In adults who have lymphoma (a cancer of the white blood cells) or multiple myeloma (a cancer 
that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow). </p>

<p>You will first receive G-CSF, then you will be given Plerixafor Accord 
Mobilisation will be started by first giving you another medicine called G-CSF (granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor). G-CSF will help Plerixafor Accord to work properly in your body. If you want to 
know more about G-CSF ask your doctor and read the corresponding package leaflet. </p>

The recommended adult dose is either a 20 mg (fixed dose) or 0.24 mg/kg body weight/day. 
The recommended dose for children, 1 to less than 18 years of age is 0.24 mg/kg of body weight/day. </p>
<p>Your dose will depend on your body weight, which should be measured the week before you receive 
your first dose. If you have moderate or severe kidney problems, your doctor will reduce the dose. </p>
<p>How is Plerixafor Accord given? 
Plerixafor Accord is given by subcutaneous injection (under your skin). </p>

Treatment lasts 2 to 4 consecutive days (in some cases up to 7 days), until enough stem cells have 
been collected for your transplant. In a few cases, enough stem cells may not be collected, and the 
collection attempt will be stopped. </p>         </div>"""
