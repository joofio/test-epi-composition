Pluvicto contains lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan. This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical 
product for therapy only. </p>
<p>What Pluvicto is used for 
Pluvicto is used to treat adults with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to 
other parts of the body (metastatic) and has already been treated with other cancer treatments. 
Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate (a gland of the male reproductive 
system) that does not respond to treatment that reduces male hormones. Pluvicto is used if the prostate 
cancer cells have a protein on their surface called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). </p>
<p>How Pluvicto works 
Pluvicto binds to PSMA found on the surface of the prostate cancer cells. Once bound, the radioactive 
substance in Pluvicto, lutetium-177, gives off radiation that causes the prostate cancer cells to die. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out tests to see if PSMA is present on the surface of the cancer cells. Your 
cancer is more likely to respond to treatment with Pluvicto if the test result is positive. </p>
<p>The use of Pluvicto involves exposure to amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear 
medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with 
the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Pluvicto works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your nuclear medicine doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Pluvicto must not be used 
- if you are allergic to lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
If any of these apply to you, tell your nuclear medicine doctor before receiving Pluvicto:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have low levels of certain types of cells in the blood (red blood cells, white blood cells, 
neutrophils, platelets) </li>
<li>if you have or have had tiredness, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, bleeding or bruising 
more easily than normal or bleeding for longer than normal, or frequent infections with signs 
such as fever, chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers (possible signs of myelosuppression [a 
condition in which the bone marrow cannot make enough blood cells]) </li>
<li>if you have or have had kidney problems </li>
<li>if you have or have had any other type of cancer or treatment for cancer, as Pluvicto contributes 
to your overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure </li>
</ul>
<p>Before administration of Pluvicto you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>drink plenty of water so that you remain hydrated and urinate as often as possible during the 
first hours after administration </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of this medicine have not been established in children and adolescents under 
18 years of age. This medicine should not be given to children or adolescents aged under 18 years 
because no data are available in this age group. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pluvicto is not intended for use in women. </p>
<p>Before you receive Pluvicto, tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are sexually active as all 
radiopharmaceuticals, including Pluvicto, have the potential to cause harm to an unborn baby. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Pluvicto may cause infertility. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor how this may affect you, 
especially if you are planning to have children in the future. You may wish to seek advice on 
preservation of sperm before treatment starts. </p>
<p>Contraception in males 
- You should avoid sexual activity for 7 days after administration of Pluvicto. 
- You should not father a child and should use a condom during intercourse throughout treatment 
with Pluvicto and for 14 weeks after your last dose. 
- Tell your nuclear medicine doctor immediately if you father a child at any time during this time 
period. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Pluvicto will affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Pluvicto contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 88.75 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. 
This is equivalent to 4.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Use of toilets 
Take special precautions to avoid contamination for 2 days after administration:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must always sit when using the toilet. </li>
<li>It is essential that you use toilet paper every time you use the toilet. </li>
<li>Always wash your hands well after using the toilet. </li>
<li>Flush all wipes and/or toilet paper down the toilet immediately after use. </li>
<li>Flush any tissues or any other items that contain bodily waste, such as blood, urine and faeces 
down the toilet. Items that cannot be flushed down the toilet, such as bandages, must be placed 
in separate plastic waste disposal bags (according to  Waste disposal recommendations  below). </li>
<li>Any special medical equipment that could be contaminated by your bodily fluids (e.g. catheter 
bags, colostomy bags, bedpans, water nozzles) must be emptied immediately into the toilet and 
then cleaned. </li>
</ul>
<p>Showering and laundry 
- Take a shower every day for at least 7 days after administration. 
- Wash your underwear, pyjamas, sheets and any clothes that contain sweat, blood or urine 
separately from the laundry of others in your household, using a standard washing cycle. You 
do not need to use bleach and you do not need extra rinses. </p>
<p>Care givers 
For 2-3 days after administration:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who are confined to bed or have reduced mobility will preferably receive assistance from 
a care giver. It is recommended that when providing assistance in the bathroom, the care giver 
wears disposable gloves. </li>
<li>Care givers who clean up vomit, blood, urine or faeces should wear plastic gloves, which should 
be disposed of in a separate plastic waste disposal bag (see  Waste disposal recommendations<br />
below). </li>
</ul>
<p>Waste disposal recommendations 
- All items to be thrown away should be discarded in a separate plastic waste disposal bag to be 
used only for this purpose. 
- Keep the plastic waste disposal bags separate from the other household waste and away from 
children and animals. 
- A member of the hospital staff will tell you how and when to get rid of these waste disposal 
bags. </p>
<p>Hospitalisation and emergency care 
- If for any reason you require emergency medical assistance or are unexpectedly admitted to the 
hospital during the first 7 days after administration, you should inform the healthcare 
professionals about the name, date and dose of your radioactive treatment. </p>
<p>Other precautions 
- The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions 
after receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more Pluvicto than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because you will only receive Pluvicto in doses that are precisely controlled 
by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the event of an overdose, you 
will receive the appropriate treatment. </p>
<p>If you forget to receive Pluvicto 
If you miss an appointment to receive Pluvicto, contact your nuclear medicine doctor as soon as 
possible to reschedule. </p>
<p>Should you have any further questions on the use of Pluvicto, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""
