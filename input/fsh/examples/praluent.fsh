* Praluent contains the active substance alirocumab.<br />
<em> Praluent is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein designed to attach to a target 
substance in the body). Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to other unique 
proteins. Alirocumab binds to PCSK9. How Praluent works 
Praluent helps lower your levels of  bad  cholesterol (also called  LDL cholesterol ). Praluent blocks a 
protein called PCSK9. * PCSK9 is a protein secreted by liver cells. 
*  Bad  cholesterol is normally removed from your blood by binding to specific  receptors  (docking 
stations) in your liver.<br />
</em> PCSK9 lowers the number of these receptors in the liver   this causes your  bad  cholesterol to be 
higher than it should.<br />
* By blocking PCSK9, Praluent increases the number of receptors available to help remove the  bad<br />
cholesterol   this lowers your  bad  cholesterol levels. </p>
<p>What Praluent is used for 
* Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood (hypercholesterolaemia [heterozygous familial and 
non-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia) and children and adolescents 8 years of age and older with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH).<br />
* Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood and with cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk.  </p>
<p>It is given:</p>
<ul>
<li>together with a statin (a commonly used medicine that treats high cholesterol) or other cholesterol 
lowering medicines, if the maximum dose of a statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently 
or, </li>
<li>alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or cannot 
be used. </li>
</ul>
<p>Continue to follow your cholesterol-lowering diet while taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
