  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Pravafenix contains two active substances: pravastatin and fenofibrate. Both are cholesterol/lipid 
modifying medicines.  </p>
<p>Pravafenix is used in addition to low fat diet in adults 
- To lower the level of your  bad  cholesterol (LDL cholesterol). It does this by lowering the level 
of total cholesterol, and fatty substances called triglycerides in the blood.<br />
- To raise the level of your  good  cholesterol (HDL cholesterol). </p>
<p>What should I know about cholesterol and triglycerides? 
Cholesterol is one of several fats found in your blood. Your total cholesterol is made up mainly of 
LDL and HDL cholesterol.  </p>
<p>LDL cholesterol is often called  bad  cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of your arteries 
and form plaque. Over time, this plaque build-up can lead to a clogging of your arteries. This clogging 
can slow or block blood flow to vital organs such as the heart and brain. When the blood flow is 
blocked, the result can be a heart attack or stroke.  </p>
<p>HDL cholesterol is often called  good  cholesterol because it helps keep the  bad  cholesterol from 
building up in the arteries and because it protects against heart disease.  </p>
<p>Triglycerides are another fat in your blood. They may raise your risk of having heart problems.  </p>
<p>In most people, there are no signs of cholesterol problems at first. Your doctor can measure your 
cholesterol with a simple blood test. Visit your doctor regularly to keep track of your cholesterol level.  </p>
<p>Pravafenix is used if you are an adult with an elevated risk for heart disease and need to improve 
cholesterol and triglycerides fat levels in your blood when your  bad  cholesterol levels are being 
adequately controlled with pravastatin alone (a statin, a cholesterol-lowering medicine). </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to fenofibrate, pravastatin, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if you suffer from liver disease.<br />
- if you are under 18 years old. 
- if you suffer from kidney disease. 
- if you have had photoallergy (allergic reaction caused by sunlight or exposure to UV light) or 
phototoxic reactions (damage to skin caused by exposure to sunlight or UV light) during treatment 
with fibrates (lipid-modifying medicines) or ketoprofen (an anti-inflammatory medicine that can 
be used orally or on the skin for muscle and bone disorders, and orally for gout or period pain) 
- if you suffer from gallbladder disease. 
- if you suffer from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas leading to abdominal pain) 
- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
- if you have a history of muscle problems (e.g. myopathy or rhabdomyolysis) during treatment 
with cholesterol-controlling medicines called  statins  (such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, 
pravastatin or rosuvastatin) or fibrates (such as fenofibrate and bezafibrate). </p>
<p>Do not take Pravafenix if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking Pravafenix. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pravafenix. </p>
<p>Before you take Pravafenix you should tell your doctor if you have or have had any medical problems. 
- Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions including allergies. 
- Tell your doctor if you drink large amounts of alcohol (if you drink more than the recommended 
daily amount; ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure) or have ever had liver disease. See 
also below section  Taking Pravafenix with food and drink . 
- Your doctor should do a blood test before you start taking Pravafenix. This is to check how well 
your liver and your kidneys are working. 
- Your doctor may also want you to have blood tests to check how well your liver is working after 
you start taking Pravafenix. 
- If you have or have had myasthenia (a disease with general muscle weakness including in some 
cases muscles used when breathing), or ocular myasthenia (a disease causing eye muscle 
weakness) as statins may sometimes aggravate the condition or lead to the occurrence of 
myasthenia (see section 4). </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. 
This is because, on rare occasions, muscle problems can be serious, including muscle breakdown 
resulting in kidney damage, and very rarely deaths have occurred. </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have a muscle weakness that is constant.<br />
Additional tests and medicines may be needed to diagnose and treat this. </p>
<p>The risk of muscle breakdown is greater in certain patients. Tell your doctor if any of the following 
applies to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liver or kidney problems </li>
<li>Thyroid problems </li>
<li>You are more than 70 years old </li>
<li>You have ever had muscle problems during a treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such   <br />
as a statin or fibrate </li>
<li>You are taking or have taken in the last 7 days a medicine called fusidic acid, (a medicine for 
bacterial infection) orally or by injection. The combination of fusidic acid and Pravafenix can lead 
to serious muscle problems (rhabdomyolysis).  </li>
<li>You or your close family members have a hereditary muscle disorder </li>
<li>You have alcohol problems (regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol) 
Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pravafenix if you have severe respiratory failure, 
e.g. you have breathing problems including, persistent non-productive cough, deterioration in general 
health like fatigue (tiredness), weight loss and/or shortness of breath or fever. 
If you feel any of these symptoms you should stop taking Pravafenix and inform your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>While you are on this medicine your doctor will monitor you closely if you have diabetes or are at risk 
of developing diabetes. You are likely to be at risk of developing diabetes if you have high levels of 
sugars and fats in your blood, are overweight and have high blood pressure. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not take Pravafenix if you are under 18 years old </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pravafenix 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. It is important that you inform your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the 
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bile acid resins such as colestyramine/colestipol (a medicine for lowering cholesterol), because it 
affects the way Pravafenix works. </li>
<li>Ciclosporin (a medicine often used in organ transplant patients). </li>
<li>Medicines to prevent blood clots, such as warfarin, fluindione, phenprocoumon or acenocoumarol 
(anticoagulants)  </li>
<li>An antibiotic such as erythromycin, clarithromycin to treat infections caused by bacteria. </li>
<li>Fusidic acid: If you need to take oral fusidic acid to treat a bacterial infection you will need to 
temporarily stop using this medicine. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to restart 
Pravafenix. Taking Pravafenix with fusidic acid may rarely lead to muscle weakness, tenderness 
or pain (rhabdomyolysis). See more information regarding rhabdomyolysis in section 4. - Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (used to treat hepatitis C virus infection) because it can increase some 
adverse events including muscle problems.  </li>
<li>a particular class of medicines to treat diabetes (such as rosiglitazone, pioglitazone)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Pravafenix with food, drink and alcohol 
- Always take Pravafenix with food as Pravafenix is less well absorbed from an empty stomach. 
- You should always keep your alcohol intake to a minimum. If you are concerned about how much 
alcohol you can drink while you are taking this medicine, you should discuss this with your 
doctor.<br />
If you are not sure about this, please follow your doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Pravafenix if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant or think you may be pregnant. 
If you plan to become pregnant or become pregnant, inform your doctor immediately. The medicine 
must be discontinued because of the potential risk to the foetus. </p>
<p>Do not take Pravafenix if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Pravafenix does not usually affect your ability to drive or use machines. If you experience any 
dizziness, blurred or double vision during treatment, make sure you are fit to drive and use machines 
before attempting to do so. </p>
<p>Pravafenix contains lactose and sodium 
Pravafenix contains a sugar called lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. 
This medicine contains 33.3 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each capsule 
(excipients and active substance). This is equivalent to 1.7% of the recommended maximum daily 
dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

- You should keep to this diet while taking Pravafenix </p>
<p>The usual dose is one capsule taken daily during the evening meal. Swallow the capsule with water. It 
is important to take the capsule with food, as it won t work as well if your stomach is empty. </p>
<p>When your doctor has prescribed Pravafenix along with colestyramine or any other bile acid binding 
resins (medicines for lowering cholesterol), take Pravafenix 1 hour before, or 4 to 6 hours after the 
resin. This is because colestyramine or other bile acid binding resins frequently reduce the absorption 
of medicines when taken too closely together and so may impede the absorption of Pravafenix. If you 
take indigestion remedies (used to neutralise acid in your stomach), take Pravafenix 1 hour after. </p>
<p>If you take more Pravafenix than you should 
Please contact your doctor or pharmacist </p>
<p>If you forget to take Pravafenix 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, just take your normal amount of Pravafenix 
at the usual time the next day. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Pravafenix 
Do not stop taking Pravafenix without first discussing it with your doctor. </p>
