PREZISTA is an antiretroviral medicine used in the treatment of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of
medicines called protease inhibitors. PREZISTA works by reducing the
amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your immune system and
reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. What
it is used for? PREZISTA is used to treat HIV infected adults as well as
HIV infected children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15
kilogram body weight (see How to take PREZISTA). PREZISTA must be taken
in combination with a low dose of cobicistat or ritonavir and other
anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination
of medicines is best for you.</p>

HIV infection. People taking PREZISTA may still develop infections or
other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You must keep in regular
contact with your doctor. People taking PREZISTA may develop a skin
rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or potentially
life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a
rash. In patients taking PREZISTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection),
rashes (generally mild or moderate) may occur more frequently than in
patients taking either medicine separately. Tell your doctor about your
situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment Make sure that you check the
following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.</h2>

your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients
taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease
called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood
supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy,
corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression,
higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk
factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder)
and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please
inform your doctor. Elderly PREZISTA has only been used in limited
numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this age group,
please discuss with your doctor if you can use PREZISTA. Children
PREZISTA is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or
weighing less than 15 kilograms. Other medicines and PREZISTA Tell your
doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other
medicines. There are some medicines that you must not combine with
PREZISTA. These are mentioned above under the heading Do not combine
PREZISTA with any of the following medicines: In most cases, PREZISTA
can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g.
NRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs
(non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and
FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. PREZISTA with cobicistat or ritonavir has not
been tested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with
other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage of other medicines might need to be
changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other anti-HIV
medicines and follow your doctor s instruction carefully on which
medicines can be combined. The effects of PREZISTA might be reduced if
you take any of the following products. Tell your doctor if you

PREZISTA. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor immediately if
you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Pregnant women should
not take PREZISTA with ritonavir unless specifically directed by the
doctor. Pregnant women should not take PREZISTA with cobicistat. Because
of the potential for side effects in breast-fed infants, women should
not breast-feed if they are receiving PREZISTA. Breast-feeding is not
recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed
on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking
about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as
possible. Driving and using machines Do not operate machines or drive if
you feel dizzy after taking PREZISTA. PREZISTA oral suspension contains
sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate. This ingredient may cause allergic
reactions (sometimes delayed). PREZISTA contains sodium This medicine
contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say
essentially sodium-free .</p>

HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood
lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and life
style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines
themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. Like all medicines,
this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects Liver
problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor
should do blood tests before you start PREZISTA. If you have chronic
hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check your blood tests
more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver
problems. Talk to your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver
problems. These may include yellowing of your skin or whites of your
eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements),
nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and
discomfort on your right side below your ribs. Skin rash (more often
when used in combination with raltegravir), itching. The rash is usually
mild to moderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a rare severe
situation. It is important to talk to your doctor if you develop a rash.
Your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms or whether
PREZISTA must be stopped. Other severe side effects were diabetes

PREZISTA er et lægemiddel, som forhindrer virus af typen retrovirus i at
formere sig (antiretroviralt lægemiddel). PREZISTA anvendes til
behandling af hiv-infektion (hiv: humant immundefektvirus). Det tilhører
den lægemiddelgruppe, der kaldes proteasehæmmere. PREZISTA virker ved at
reducere mængden af hiv i kroppen. Dette forbedrer immunforsvaret og
nedsætter risikoen for at udvikle sygdomme, der er forbundet med
hiv-infektion. Hvad anvendes det til? PREZISTA anvendes til at behandle
hiv-infektion hos voksne samt hos børn fra 3 år og opefter med en
legemsvægt på mindst 15 kg (se Sådan skal du tage PREZISTA). PREZISTA
skal tages i kombination med en lavdosis cobicistat eller ritonavir og
anden hiv-medicin. Din læge vil fortælle dig, hvilken
medicinkombination, der er bedst for dig.</p>

du har alvorlige leverproblemer. Du skal spørge din læge, hvis du ikke
er sikker på, hvor alvorlig din leversygdom er. Det kan være nødvendigt
at foretage yderligere test. Fortæl lægen om alle lægemidler, du tager,
herunder medicin, som du tager gennem munden, inhalerer, indsprøjter
eller påfører på huden. Du må ikke tage PREZISTA sammen med følgende
medicin Hvis du tager et af disse lægemidler, skal du tale med din læge
om at skifte til en anden medicin. 144 Medicin Formålet med medicinen
Avanafil til behandling af impotens Astemizol eller terfenadin til
behandling af symptomer på allergi Triazolam eller midazolam (indtaget
gennem munden) som sovemiddel og/eller til at afhjælpe angst Cisaprid
til behandling af visse mavelidelser Colchicin (hvis du har problemer
med nyrerne og/eller leveren) til behandling af urinsur gigt eller
familiær middelhavsfeber Lurasidon, pimozid, quetiapin eller sertindol
til behandling af psykiske lidelser Sekalealkaloider (f.eks. ergotamin,
dihydroergotamin, ergometrin og methylergometrin) til behandling af
migrænehovedpine Amiodaron, bepridil, dronedaron, ivabradin, kinidin,
ranolazin til behandling af visse hjertelidelser som f.eks. unormal
hjerterytme Lovastatin, simvastatin og lomitapid til nedsættelse af
kolesterol i blodet Rifampicin til behandling af visse infektioner såsom
tuberkulose Kombinationsproduktet lopinavir/ritonavir denne medicin mod
hiv tilhører samme gruppe som PREZISTA Elbasvir/grazoprevir til
behandling af hepatitis C-infektion Alfuzosin til behandling af
forstørret blærehalskirtel (prostata) Sildenafil til behandling af for
højt blodtryk i lungekredsløbet Ticagrelor som hjælp til at hindre
sammenklumpning af blodplader hos patienter, der tidligere har haft et
hjerteanfald Naloxegol til behandling af forstoppelse forårsaget af
opioidbehandling Dapoxetin til behandling af for tidlig sædafgang
Domperidon til behandling af kvalme og opkastning PREZISTA må ikke
kombineres med naturlægemidler, der indeholder perikon (Hypericum
perforatum). Advarsler og forsigtighedsregler Kontakt lægen,
apotekspersonalet eller sygeplejersken, før du tager PREZISTA. PREZISTA
kan ikke helbrede hiv-infektion. Personer, der tager PREZISTA, kan
stadig udvikle infektioner eller andre sygdomme forbundet med
hiv-infektion. Du skal være i løbende kontakt med din læge. Personer,
der tager PREZISTA, kan udvikle hududslæt. I sjældne tilfælde kan
hududslættet blive alvorligt eller måske livstruende. Kontakt din læge,
hvis du får hududslæt. Patienter, der får PREZISTA sammen med
raltegravir (mod hiv-infektion), kan hyppigere få udslæt end patienter,
der kun får det ene af disse lægemidler. Udslættet vil generelt være
mildt eller moderat. Fortæl din læge om dit helbred FØR og UNDER din
behandling Sørg for at tjekke følgende punkter og fortæl din læge, hvis
nogen af dem gælder for dig.</h2>

straks din læge, hvis du bemærker nogen symptomer på infektion (f.eks.
forstørrede lymfeknuder og feber). Hos nogle patienter med fremskreden
hiv-infektion som tidligere har haft infektioner på grund af svækket
immunforsvar (opportunistisk infektion) kan der forekomme tegn og
symptomer på betændelsestilstand fra tidligere infektion kort tid efter
påbegyndelse af hiv-behandling. Det menes, at disse symptomer skyldes en
forbedring af kroppens immunforsvar, der gør det muligt for kroppen at
bekæmpe infektioner, der kan have været til stede uden nogen tydelige
symptomer.</h2>

over de opportunistiske infektioner kan autoimmune lidelser (skyldes, at
immunsystemet angriber sundt kropsvæv) også opstå, efter du er begyndt
at tage medicin til behandling af din hiv-infektion. Autoimmune lidelser
kan opstå mange måneder efter, du er påbegyndt behandling. Du skal
straks informere din læge for at få den nødvendige behandling, hvis du
bemærker symptomer på infektion eller andre symptomer, såsom
muskelsvaghed, svaghed begyndende i hænder og fødder, og som bevæger sig

din læge, hvis du har problemer med muskler eller knogler. Nogle
patienter, der tager antiretroviral kombinationsmedicin, kan udvikle en
knoglesygdom, hvor knoglevævet dør på grund af manglende blodforsyning
til knoglen (osteonekrose). Varigheden af antiretroviral
kombinationsbehandling, brug af binyrebarkhormoner, alkoholforbrug,
alvorlig svækkelse af immunforsvaret og højt Body Mass Index (BMI) kan
være nogle af de mange risikofaktorer for udvikling af denne sygdom.
Tegnene på osteonekrose omfatter: Stivhed, ømhed og smerter i led (især
hofter, knæ og skuldre) samt problemer med at bevæge sig. Hvis du
bemærker nogen af disse symptomer, bedes du kontakte din læge. Ældre
PREZISTA har kun været anvendt til et begrænset antal patienter over 65
år. Hvis du tilhører denne aldersgruppe, skal du spørge din læge, om du
kan anvende PREZISTA. Børn PREZISTA er ikke beregnet til brug til børn
under 3 år eller med en legemsvægt under 15 kg. Brug af anden medicin
sammen med PREZISTA Fortæl det altid til lægen eller apotekspersonalet,
hvis du bruger anden medicin, for nylig har brugt anden medicin eller
planlægger at bruge anden medicin. Nogle typer medicin må du ikke tage
sammen med PREZISTA. Disse er nævnt ovenfor under overskriften "Du må
ikke tage PREZISTA sammen med følgende medicin" I de fleste tilfælde kan
PREZISTA tages sammen med hiv-medicin, der tilhører en anden gruppe
f.eks. NRTI (nukleosid revers-transkriptase-hæmmere), NNRTI
(non-nukleosid revers-transkriptase- hæmmere), CCR5-antagonister og FI
(fusionshæmmere). PREZISTA med cobicistat eller ritonavir er ikke blevet
testet med alle proteasehæmmere og må ikke bruges med andre
hiv-proteasehæmmere. I nogle tilfælde kan der være behov for at ændre
doseringen af andre lægemidler. Du skal derfor altid fortælle din læge,
hvis du tager anden hiv-medicin og følge din læges anvisninger nøje med
hensyn til hvilken medicin, der kan tages sammen. Virkningen af PREZISTA
kan blive nedsat, hvis du tager et eller flere af følgende produkter. Du
skal fortælle din læge, hvis du tager:</h2>

Brug af PREZISTA sammen med mad og drikke Se punkt 3 "Sådan skal du tage
PREZISTA". Graviditet og amning Fortæl straks din læge, hvis du er
gravid eller planlægger at blive gravid. Gravide kvinder bør ikke tage
PREZISTA sammen med ritonavir, medmindre lægen specifikt har foreskrevet
det. Gravide kvinder bør ikke tage PREZISTA sammen med cobicistat. På
grund af risikoen for bivirkninger hos det ammede barn må kvinder ikke
amme, hvis de får PREZISTA. Amning frarådes hos kvinder, der er
hiv-positive, da hiv-infektion kan overføres til barnet gennem
modermælken. Hvis du ammer eller påtænker at amme, bør du drøfte det med
lægen hurtigst muligt. Trafik- og arbejdssikkerhed Du må ikke betjene
maskiner eller køre bil, hvis du føler dig svimmel efter indtagelse af
PREZISTA. PREZISTA oral suspension indeholder

mere end 12 timer, skal du springe den pågældende dosis over og tage de
næste doser som sædvanligt. Du må ikke tage en dobbeltdosis som
erstatning for den glemte dosis. Hvis du kaster op efter at have taget
PREZISTA og cobicistat eller ritonavir Hvis du kaster op inden for 4
timer efter at have taget medicinen, skal du tage en ny dosis PREZISTA
og cobicistat eller ritonavir sammen med mad snarest muligt. Hvis du
kaster op mere end 4 timer efter at have taget medicinen, behøver du
ikke at tage en ny dosis PREZISTA og cobicistat eller ritonavir, før det
er tid til den næste planlagte dosis. Kontakt din læge, hvis du er i
tvivl om, hvad du skal gøre, hvis du har glemt at tage en dosis eller
har kastet op. 150 Du må ikke stoppe med at tage PREZISTA uden først at
tale med din læge Lægemidler til behandling af hiv kan få dig til at
føle dig bedre. Selvom du har det bedre, må du ikke stoppe med at tage
PREZISTA. Tal med din læge først. Spørg lægen, apotekspersonalet eller
sygeplejersken, hvis der er noget, du er i tvivl om.</li>

hiv-behandling kan der forekomme vægtstigning samt forhøjede niveauer af
lipider og glukose i blodet. Dette er til dels forbundet med forbedret
helbredstilstand og med livsstil, og for lipidernes vedkommende
sommetider med selve hiv-medicinen. Lægen vil holde øje med disse
ændringer. Dette lægemiddel kan som alle andre lægemidler give
bivirkninger, men ikke alle får bivirkninger. Fortæl din læge, hvis du
får nogen af de følgende bivirkninger Der er rapporteret om
leverproblemer, der somme tider kan være alvorlige. Din læge bør udføre
nogle blodprøver, før du starter på PREZISTA. Hvis du har kronisk
hepatitis B eller C, skal du oftere til blodprøvekontrol hos lægen,
fordi du så har en øget risiko for at få leverproblemer. Tal med din
læge om symptomerne på leverproblemer. De kan omfatte gulfarvning af
huden og det hvide i øjene, mørk (tefarvet) urin, bleg afføring, kvalme,
opkastning, appetittab eller smerter, jag eller smerter og ubehag i
højre side under ribbenene. Hududslæt (ses oftere ved kombination af
raltegravir), kløe. Udslættet er sændvanligvis mildt til moderat. Et
hududslæt kan også være et symptom på en sjælden, men alvorlig
situation. Det er vigtigt at tale med lægen, hvis du får udslæt. Din
læge vil rådgive dig om, hvad du skal gøre ved symptomerne, eller om du
skal holde op med at tage PREZISTA. Andre alvorlige bivirkninger var
diabetes (almindelig) og betændelse i bugspytkirtlen (ikke almindelig).

PREZISTA é um medicamento antirretroviral, utilizado no tratamento da
infeção pelo Vírus da Imunodeficiência Humana (VIH). Pertence a um grupo
de medicamentos denominado inibidores da protease. PREZISTA atua
reduzindo a quantidade de VIH presente no seu corpo. Desta forma, irá
melhorar o seu sistema imunológico e reduzir o risco de desenvolvimento
de doenças associadas à infeção pelo VIH. Para que é utilizado? PREZISTA
é utilizado no tratamento de adultos e crianças com idade igual ou
superior a 3 anos e com, pelo menos, 15 quilogramas de peso corporal
infetados pelo VIH (ver Como tomar PREZISTA). PREZISTA deve ser
administrado em associação com uma dose baixa de cobicistate ou
ritonavir e outros medicamentos anti-VIH. O seu médico falará consigo
sobre qual será a associação de medicamentos melhor para o seu caso.</p>

Fale com o seu médico, farmacêutico ou enfermeiro antes de tomar
PREZISTA. PREZISTA não é uma cura para a infeção pelo VIH. Os indivíduos
que tomam PREZISTA podem continuar a desenvolver infeções ou outras
doenças associadas à infeção por VIH. Deve manter um contacto regular
com o seu médico. Os indivíduos a tomar PREZISTA podem desenvolver uma
erupção na pele. Pouco frequentemente uma erupção na pele pode tornar-se
grave ou potencialmente fatal. Contacte, por favor, o seu médico sempre
que desenvolver uma erupção na pele. As erupções na pele (geralmente
ligeiras ou moderadas) podem ocorrer mais frequentemente nos doentes a
tomar PREZISTA e raltegravir (para infeção por VIH) do que nos doentes a
tomar os medicamentos em separado. Informe o seu médico sobre a sua
situação ANTES e DURANTE o seu tratamento Assegure-se que revê os pontos
a seguir referidos e informe o seu médico se algum é aplicável à sua
situação. 156</h2>

infeção anterior logo após iniciar um tratamento anti-VIH. Pensa-se que
estes sintomas são devidos a uma melhoria da resposta imunológica do
organismo, que permite ao organismo combater as infeções que se

o seu médico se notar alguns problemas musculoesqueléticos. Alguns
doentes que tomam terapêutica antirretroviral combinada podem
desenvolver uma doença nos ossos denominada osteonecrose (morte do
tecido ósseo causada por uma perda de fornecimento de sangue aos ossos).
Alguns dos vários fatores de risco para o desenvolvimento desta doença
são a duração da terapêutica antirretroviral combinada, utilização de
corticosteroides, consumo de álcool, imunodepressão grave e índice de
massa corporal elevado. Os sinais da osteonecrose são rigidez nas
articulações, dores (especialmente na anca, joelho e ombro) ou
dificuldade nos movimentos. Se notar qualquer destes sintomas, por favor
informe o seu médico. Idosos PREZISTA foi administrado a um número
limitado de doentes com idade igual ou superior a 65 anos. Se pertence a
este grupo etário, fale com o seu médico para saber se pode utilizar
PREZISTA. Crianças PREZISTA não é para ser tomado por crianças com menos
de 3 anos de idade ou com peso inferior a 15 quilogramas. Outros
medicamentos e PREZISTA Informe o seu médico se estiver a tomar ou tiver
tomado recentemente outros medicamentos. Existem alguns medicamentos que
não poderá combinar com PREZISTA. Estes são mencionados no título “Não
combine PREZISTA com qualquer um dos seguintes medicamentos". Na maioria
dos casos, PREZISTA pode ser combinado com outros medicamentos anti-VIH,
pertencentes a outra classe de medicamentos [por exemplo: NRTIs
(análogos dos nucleosídeos inibidores da transcriptase reversa), NNRTIs
(análogos não nucleosídeos inibidores da transcriptase reversa),
antagonistas dos recetores CCR5 e IFs (inibidores da fusão)]. A
associação de PREZISTA com cobicistate ou ritonavir não foi testada com
todos os IPs (inibidores da protease) e não deve ser utilizado com
outros IPs do VIH. Em alguns casos, pode ser necessário alterar a dose
de outros medicamentos. Assim, informe sempre o seu médico se está a
tomar outro medicamento anti-VIH e siga cuidadosamente as suas
instruções sobre que medicamentos podem ser associados. Os efeitos de

secção 3 “Como tomar PREZISTA". Gravidez e amamentação Informe
imediatamente o seu médico se está grávida ou se planeia engravidar. As
mulheres grávidas não devem tomar PREZISTA com ritonavir, a não ser se
especificamente recomendado pelo médico. As mulheres grávidas não devem
tomar PREZISTA com cobicistate. Devido ao potencial de efeitos
indesejáveis em lactentes amamentados, as mulheres não devem amamentar
se estiverem a ser tratadas com PREZISTA. A amamentação não é
recomendada em mulheres que vivem com VIH porque a infeção pelo VIH pode
passar para o bebé através do leite materno. Se está a amamentar ou
pensa em amamentar, deverá, assim que possível, aconselhar-se com o seu
médico. Condução de veículos e utilização de máquinas Não conduza nem
utilize quaisquer máquinas caso sinta tonturas após tomar PREZISTA.

Este ingrediente pode causar reações alérgicas (por vezes retardadas).

a terapêutica para o VIH pode haver um aumento do peso e dos níveis de
lípidos e glucose no sangue. Isto está em parte associado a uma
recuperação da saúde e do estilo de vida e, no caso dos lípidos no
sangue, por vezes aos próprios medicamentos para o VIH. O seu médico irá
realizar testes para determinar estas alterações. Como todos os
medicamentos, este medicamento pode causar efeitos indesejáveis, embora
estes não se manifestem em todas as pessoas. Informe o seu médico se
desenvolver qualquer dos seguintes efeitos indesejáveis Foram
notificados problemas de fígado que podem ocasionalmente ser graves.
Antes de iniciar PREZISTA, o seu médico deverá pedir-lhe análises ao
sangue. Se tiver infeção crónica por hepatite B ou C, o seu médico irá
pedir-lhe análises ao sangue mais frequentemente, visto que tem uma
probabilidade mais elevada de desenvolver problemas de fígado. Fale com
o seu médico acerca dos sinais e sintomas dos problemas de fígado. Estes
podem incluir coloração amarelada da pele ou da 162 zona branca dos
olhos, urina escurecida (da cor do chá), fezes de cor clara (movimentos
dos intestinos), náuseas, vómitos, perda de apetite, ou dor, sensação
dolorosa ou dor e desconforto do lado direito por baixo das costelas.
Erupção na pele (mais frequentemente quando usado em associação com
raltegravir), comichão. A erupção na pele é geralmente ligeira a
moderada. A erupção na pele pode também ser um sintoma de uma situação
rara grave. É importante falar com o seu médico se desenvolver erupção
na pele. O seu médico irá aconselhar sobre como lidar com os seus
sintomas ou se deve interromper o tratamento com PREZISTA. Outros
efeitos indesejáveis graves incluem a diabetes (frequente) e inflamação
do pâncreas (pouco frequente). Efeitos indesejáveis muito frequentes
