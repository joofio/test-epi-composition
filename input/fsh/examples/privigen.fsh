Privigen belongs to the class of medicines called human normal immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins 
are also known as antibodies and are blood proteins that help your body to fight infections.
How Privigen works
Privigen contains immunoglobulins that have been prepared from the blood of healthy people. The 
medicine works in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins naturally present in human blood of 
healthy people.
What Privigen is used for
Privigen is used for the treatment of adults and children (0-18 years) in the following situations:
A)
To increase abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels 
(replacement therapy):
1. Patients who are born with a reduced ability or inability to produce immunoglobulins
(primary immunodeficiencies (PID)).
2. Patients with an acquired immunodeficiency (SID) who suffer from severe or recurrent 
infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure 
or serum IgG level of &lt;4 g/l.
B)
To treat certain inflammatory disorders (immunomodulation). There are 5 groups:
1. Patients who do not have enough blood platelets (primary immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) and who are at high risk of bleeding or will have surgery in the near future.
2. Patients with Guillain-Barr  syndrome. This is an acute disease that is characterised by 
inflammation of the peripheral nerves that causes severe muscle weakness mainly in the 
legs and upper limbs.
3. Patients with Kawasaki disease. This is an acute disease that primarily affects young 
children. It is characterised by inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body.
4. Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). This is a 
chronic disease that is characterised by inflammation of the peripheral nerves that causes
muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly in the legs and upper limbs.
5. Patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). This is a slowly progressive disease of 
the motor nerves with weakness of arms and legs.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Read this section carefully. The information given should be taken into consideration by you 
and your doctor before you are given Privigen.
Do NOT take Privigen</p>
<p>if you are allergic to human immunoglobulins or to proline.</p>
<p>if you have developed antibodies against immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood.</p>
<p>if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia type I or II (a genetic disorder causing high levels of the 
amino acid proline in the blood). This is an extremely rare disorder. Only a few families with 
this disease are known worldwide.
Warnings and precautions
Which circumstances increase the risk of having side effects?</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if any of the circumstances listed 
below applies to you:</p>
<p>You receive this medicine in high doses either on 1 day or over several days and you have a 
blood group A, B or AB and/or you have an underlying inflammatory condition. In these 
circumstances, it has been commonly reported that immunoglobulins increase the risk of 
breakdown of red blood cells (haemolysis).</p>
<p>You are overweight, are elderly, have diabetes, have been bedridden for a long time, have high 
blood pressure, have low blood volume (hypovolaemia), have problems with your blood vessels 
(vascular diseases), have an increased tendency for blood clotting (thrombophilia or thrombotic 
episodes) or have a disease or a condition which causes your blood to thicken (hyperviscous 
blood). In these circumstances, immunoglobulins may increase the risk of heart attack (cardiac 
infarction), stroke, blood clots in the lung (lung embolism), or blockage of a blood vessel in the 
leg, although only very rarely.</p>
<p>You are diabetic. Although Privigen does not contain sugar, it may be diluted with a special 
sugar solution (5% glucose), which could affect your blood sugar level.</p>
<p>You have or had previously problems with your kidneys or take medicinal products that may 
harm your kidneys (nephrotoxic medicinal products). In these circumstances, immunoglobulins 
may increase the risk of serious rapid loss of kidney function (acute renal failure) although only 
very rarely. Loss of kidney function with fatal outcome has occurred in isolated haemolysis-
related cases.
What kind of monitoring is required during the infusion?
For your personal safety, treatment with Privigen will take place under the supervision of your doctor 
or healthcare professional. You will usually be observed during the whole infusion and for at least 
20 minutes thereafter. In certain circumstances, special precautions may be necessary. Examples of 
such circumstances are:</p>
<p>you are receiving Privigen at a high infusion rate or</p>
<p>you are receiving Privigen for the first time or after a long break in treatment (e.g. several 
months).
In these cases you will be closely observed during the whole infusion and for at least 1 hour 
afterwards.
When may slowing or stopping the infusion be required?</p>
<p>You may be allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins without knowing it.
However, true allergic reactions are rare. They may occur even if you have previously received 
human immunoglobulins and had tolerated them well. It may happen particularly if you have 
developed antibodies against immunoglobulins of the type IgA. In these rare cases allergic 
reactions such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock may occur (see also section 4. Possible side effects ).</p>
<p>In very rare cases transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) can occur after receiving 
immunoglobulins. This will lead to non-heart related accumulation of fluid in the air spaces of 
the lungs (non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema). You will recognize TRALI by severe difficulty 
in breathing (respiratory distress), bluish skin (cyanosis), abnormally low level of oxygen in the 
blood (hypoxia), decrease in blood pressure (hypotension) and increased body temperature 
(fever). Symptoms typically appear during or within 6 hours after receiving treatment.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice such reactions 
during the infusion of Privigen. He or she will decide whether to decrease the infusion 
rate or to stop the infusion completely.
Blood tests</p>
<p>Tell your doctor about your treatment with Privigen prior to having any blood tests.
After receiving Privigen, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be impaired for a 
certain time.
Information on safety with respect to infections
Privigen is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood).
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include:</p>
<p>careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded,</p>
<p>the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections,</p>
<p>the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove 
viruses.
Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the 
possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or 
emerging viruses and other types of infections.
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and 
parvovirus B19. Immunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections, possibly 
because antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that every time you are given a dose of Privigen the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used.
Other medicines and Privigen</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are using, have recently used or might use any 
other medicines.
The concomitant use of medicines that increase the excretion of water from your body (loop diuretics) 
should be avoided during treatment with Privigen. Your doctor will decide whether you should use or 
continue treatment with loop diuretics.
Vaccinations</p>
<p>Tell your vaccinating doctor prior to a vaccination about your treatment with Privigen.
After receiving Privigen, the efficacy of certain vaccinations may be impaired. Affected are 
vaccinations with live attenuated virus vaccines such as vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella 
and varicella. Such vaccinations should be postponed for at least 3 months after the last infusion of 
Privigen. In the case of measles vaccinations the impairment may persist for up to 1 year. Therefore,
your vaccinating doctor should check the effectiveness of the measles vaccination.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are
breast-feeding. Your doctor will decide whether you can receive Privigen during your 
pregnancy or while you are breast-feeding.
Medicines containing antibodies have been used in pregnant and breast-feeding women. Long-term
experience has shown that no harmful effects during the course of the pregnancy or to the newborn are 
to be expected.
If you receive Privigen while you are breast-feeding the antibodies in this medicine will also be found 
in the breast milk. Thus, also your baby can receive the protective antibodies.
Driving and using machines
Patients may experience effects, such as dizziness or nausea, during treatment with Privigen that might 
affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should not drive or use machines until
these effects have disappeared.
Privigen contains proline
You must not take it if you suffer from hyperprolinaemia (see also section 2  What you need to know 
before you are given Privigen ).</p>
<p>Tell your doctor prior to treatment.
Sodium content
This medicine contains less than 2.3 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 100 ml. 
This is equivalent to 0.12% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

different from that for adults. At the beginning of the infusion you will receive Privigen at a slow 
infusion rate. If you tolerate this well, your doctor can gradually increase the infusion rate.
If you receive more Privigen than you should
Overdose is very unlikely to occur because Privigen is usually administered under medical 
supervision. If, in spite of this, you receive more Privigen than you should, your blood may become 
too thick (hyperviscous) which might increase the risk of developing blood clots. This may happen

shape (microscopic finding), presence of high platelet counts in the blood (thrombocytosis), 
sleepiness, shiver (tremor), palpitations, tachycardia, thromboembolic events, lack of blood supply to 
the lower extremities causing e.g. pain when walking (peripheral vascular disorder), presence of an 
excess of serum proteins in the urine (proteinuria including increased blood creatinine), injection site 
pain (including infusion site discomfort).
In isolated cases (post-marketing experience), the following have been observed in patients treated 
with Privigen: abnormally low level of specific white blood cells called neutrophils (decreased 
neutrophils counts), anaphylactic shock, painful respiration due to transfusion related lung injury 
(TRALI) and acute renal failure.
  The haemolytic anaemia cases after controlled clinical study completion were observed at 
significantly reduced frequency due to enhancements in the Privigen manufacturing process.</p>

Method of administration
For intravenous use.
Human normal immunoglobulin should be infused intravenously at an initial infusion rate of 0.3 ml/kg 
bw/hr for approximately 30 min. If well tolerated, the rate of administration may gradually be 
increased to 4.8 ml/kg bw/hr.
In PID patients who have tolerated the infusion rate of 4.8 ml/kg bw/hr well, the rate may be further 
increased gradually to a maximum of 7.2 ml/kg bw/hr.
If dilution prior to infusion is desired, Privigen may be diluted with 5% glucose solution to a final 
concentration of 50 mg/ml (5%).
Special precautions
In case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped.
It is strongly recommended that every time Privigen is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
product.
Incompatibilities
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in 
the section below.
Special precautions for disposal and other handling
The product should be brought to room or body temperature before use. A vented infusion line should 
be used for the administration of Privigen. Always pierce the stopper at its centre, within the marked 
area.
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow. Solutions that are 
cloudy or have deposits should not be used.
If dilution is desired, 5% glucose solution is recommended. For obtaining an immunoglobulin solution 
of 50 mg/ml (5%), Privigen 100 mg/ml (10%) should be diluted with an equal volume of the glucose 
solution. Aseptic technique must be strictly observed during the dilution of Privigen.
Once the vial has been entered under aseptic conditions, its contents should be used promptly. Because 
the solution contains no preservative, Privigen should be infused as soon as possible.
