the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. Cystinosis is a disease affecting how 
the body functions, with an abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine in various organs of the 
body such as the kidney, eye, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Cystine build-up causes kidney damage and 
excretion of excess amounts of glucose, proteins, and electrolytes. Different organs are affected at 
different ages. </p>
<p>PROCYSBI is a medicine that reacts with cystine to decrease its level within the cells. Cysteamine 
therapy should be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of cystinosis to achieve 
maximum benefit. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to cysteamine (also known as mercaptamine) or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>If you are allergic to penicillamine (this is not  penicillin , but a medicine used for the treatment 
of Wilson s disease). </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PROCYSBI. </p>
<p>Since oral cysteamine doesn t prevent deposits of cystine crystals in the eye, you should 
continue taking cysteamine eye drops as prescribed by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Whole cysteamine capsules should not be given to children under the age of 6 years due to the 
risk of choking (refer to section 3  How to take PROCYSBI   Method of administration ). </p>
<p>Serious skin lesions can occur in patients treated with high doses of cysteamine. Your doctor 
will routinely monitor your skin and bones and reduce or stop your treatment if needed (see 
section 4). </p>
<p>Stomach and intestinal ulcers and bleeding can occur in patients receiving cysteamine (see 
section 4).  </p>
<p>Other intestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and stomach ache can occur 
with cysteamine. Your doctor may interrupt and change your dose if these occur.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have any unusual stomach symptoms or changes in stomach 
symptoms. </p>
<p>Symptoms such as seizures, tiredness, sleepiness, depression, and brain disorders 
(encephalopathy) can occur with cysteamine. If such symptoms develop, tell your doctor who 
will adjust your dose. </p>
<p>Abnormal liver function or reduced white blood cell count (leukopenia) can occur with use of 
cysteamine. Your doctor will routinely monitor your blood counts and liver function. </p>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you for benign intracranial hypertension (or pseudotumor cerebri 
[PTC]) and/or swelling of the optic nerve (papilledema) associated with cysteamine treatment. 
You will receive regular eye examinations to identify this condition as early treatment can 
prevent vision loss. </p>
<p>Other medicines and PROCYSBI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. If your doctor prescribes bicarbonate, do not take it at the same time as PROCYSBI; take 
bicarbonate at least one hour before or at least one hour after the medicine. </p>
<p>PROCYSBI with food and drink 
For at least 1 hour before and 1 hour after taking PROCYSBI try to avoid meals, which are rich in fat 
or proteins as well as any food or liquid that could decrease the acidity in your stomach, like milk or 
yogurt. If this is not possible, you can eat a small amount (about 100 grams) of food (preferably 
carbohydrates e.g. bread, pasta, fruits) during the hour before and after taking PROCYSBI.<br />
Take the capsule with an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or water. For children 
and patients who have problems to swallow, please refer to section 3  How to take PROCYSBI <br />
Method of administration . </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant, particularly during the first trimester. Before 
starting the treatment, you should have a pregnancy test with negative result, while during the course 
of treatment you should use an adequate method of contraception. If you are a woman planning a 
pregnancy or become pregnant, seek immediate advice from your doctor about stopping therapy with 
this medicine as continued treatment may be harmful to the unborn baby.  </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine if you are breastfeeding (see section 2 under  Do not take PROCYSBI ).  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine may cause some drowsiness. When starting therapy, you should not drive, use 
machines, or engage in other dangerous activities until you know how the medicine affects you. </p>
<p>PROCYSBI contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free   </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose for you or your child will depend on your or your child s age and weight. The 
targeted maintenance dose is 1.3 g/m2/day. </p>
<p>Dosing schedule 
Take this medicine two times a day, every 12 hours. To get the most benefit from this medicine, try to 
avoid meals and dairy products for at least 1 hour before and 1 hour after PROCYSBI dosing. If this is 
not possible, you can eat a small amount (about 100 grams) of food (preferably carbohydrates e.g. 
bread, pasta, fruits) during the hour before and after PROCYSBI administration.  </p>
<p>It is important to take PROCYSBI in a consistent way over time. </p>
<p>Do not increase or decrease the amount of medicine without your doctor s approval. </p>
<p>The total usual dose should not exceed 1.95 g/m2/day. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
Treatment with PROCYSBI should continue life-long, as instructed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
You should take this medicine only by mouth. </p>
<p>In order for this medicine to work correctly, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For patients who can swallow the whole capsule: 
Swallow the whole capsule with an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or 
water. Do not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents. Children under 6 years of age may 
not be able to swallow gastro-resistant hard capsules and may choke them. You can give 
PROCYSBI to children under 6 years of age by opening the capsules and sprinkling the 
contents on food or liquid, as per the instructions given below.  </li>
</ul>
<p>For patients who cannot swallow the whole capsule or who use a feeding tube: 
Sprinkling on food 
Open the gastro-resistant hard capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) onto approximately 
100 grams of food such as apple sauce or fruit jam. 
Gently stir the granules into the soft food, creating a mixture of granules and food. Eat the entire 
mixture. Then drink about 250 mL of an acidic drink (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) 
or water to ease the swallowing of the mixture. 
If you don t eat the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2 C-8 C) it from the time of 
preparation to the time of administration and eat it within 2 hours of preparation. Nothing of the 
mixture should be saved beyond 2 hours. </p>
<p>Administering through feeding tube </p>
<p>Open the gastro-resistant hard capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) onto approximately 
100 grams of apple sauce or fruit jam. Gently stir the granules into the soft food, creating a 
mixture of granules and the soft food. Administer the mixture by gastrostomy tube, nasogastric 
tube or gastrostomy jejunostomy tube using a catheter tip syringe. Before PROCYSBI 
administration: Unclasp the G-tube button and attach the feeding tube. Flush with 5 mL of water 
to clear the button. Draw the mixture up into the syringe. A maximum 60 mL mixture volume in 
a catheter tip syringe is recommended for use with a straight or bolus feeding tube. Place the 
opening of the syringe containing the PROCYSBI and food mixture into the opening of the 
feeding tube and fill completely with the mixture: pressing gently on the syringe and keeping 
the feeding tube horizontal during administration can help to avoid clogging issues. Using a 
viscous food such as apple sauce or fruit jam at a rate of about 10 mL every 10 seconds until the 
syringe is completely empty is suggested to avoid clogging. Repeat the above step until all of 
the mixture is given. After PROCYSBI administration, draw 10 mL of fruit juice or water up 
into another syringe and flush the G-tube ensuring that none of the PROCYSBI and food 
mixture gets stuck in the G-tube. 
If you don t consume the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2 C-8 C) it from the time 
of preparation to the time of administration and consume it within 2 hours of preparation. 
Nothing of the mixture should be saved beyond 2 hours. 
Consult your child s doctor for complete instructions on how to properly administer the product 
through feeding tubes and if you experience clogging issues. </p>
<p>Sprinkling in orange juice or any acidic fruit juice or water </p>
<p>Open the gastro-resistant hard capsules and sprinkle the contents (granules) into about 100 to 
150 mL of acidic fruit juice (such as orange juice or any acidic juice) or water. Mix the 
PROCYSBI drink mixture gently for 5 minutes, either mixing in a cup or shaking in a covered 
cup (e.g.,  sippy  cup) and drink the mixture.  </p>
<p>If you don t drink the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2 C-8 C) it from the time of 
preparation to the time of administration and drink it within 30 minutes after preparation. 
Nothing of the mixture should be saved beyond 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Administering a drink mixture by oral syringe </p>
<p>Aspirate the drink mixture into a dosing syringe and administer it into the mouth directly. </p>
<p>If you don t consume the mixture immediately, you may refrigerate (2 C-8 C) it from the time 
of preparation to the time of administration and consume it within 30 minutes after preparation. 
Nothing of the mixture should be saved beyond 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend or prescribe to include, in addition to cysteamine, one or more 
supplements to replace important electrolytes lost through the kidneys. It is important to take these 
supplements exactly as instructed. If several doses of the supplements are missed or weakness or 
drowsiness develops, call your doctor for instructions. </p>
<p>Regular blood tests to measure the amount of cystine inside white blood cells and/or the concentration 
of cysteamine in the blood are necessary to help determine the correct dose of PROCYSBI. You or 
your doctor will arrange for these blood tests to be performed. These tests must be obtained 12.5 hours 
after the evening dose the day before, and therefore 30 minutes after the following morning dose is 
given. Regular blood and urine tests to measure the levels of the body s important electrolytes are also 
necessary to help you or your doctor correctly adjust the doses of these supplements. </p>
<p>If you take more PROCYSBI than you should 
You should contact your doctor or the hospital emergency department immediately if you have taken 
more PROCYSBI than you should. You may become drowsy. </p>
<p>If you forget to take PROCYSBI 
If you missed a dose of medicine, you should take it as soon as possible. However, if it is within 
4 hours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.  </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
