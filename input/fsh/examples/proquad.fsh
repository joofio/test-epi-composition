defences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. The
antibodies help protect against diseases caused by these viruses.
ProQuad is given to help protect your child against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox
(varicella). The vaccine may be administered to persons from 12 months of age.
ProQuad may also be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (to
conform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high
prevalence of measles).
Although ProQuad contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, rubella, or

<p>If the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella
vaccine or to any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin.</p>
<p>If the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the
immune system.</p>
<p>If the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medications that may weaken the
immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy).</p>
<p>If the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including
AIDS).</p>
<p>If the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary
immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of this person is demonstrated.</p>
<p>If the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis.</p>
<p>If the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5 C; however, low-
grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.</p>
<p>If the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1
month after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding).
Warnings and precautions
If the person to be vaccinated has experienced any of the following, talk to the doctor or pharmacist
before ProQuad is given:</p>
<p>An allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg.</p>
<p>A history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits).</p>
<p>A side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, and/or rubella-containing vaccines that
involved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual.</p>
<p>An infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) without showing symptoms of HIV
disease. However, vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see Do not
use ProQuad).
If you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be
given under the skin.
In rare circumstances, it is possible to catch chickenpox, including severe chickenpox, from a person
who has been vaccinated with ProQuad. This may occur in persons who have not previously been
vaccinated against chickenpox or had chickenpox, as well as persons who fall into one of the
following categories:</p>
<p>Individuals with a lowered resistance to diseases.</p>
<p>Pregnant women who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated against
chickenpox.</p>
<p>Newborn infants of mothers who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated
against chickenpox.
Whenever possible, individuals who have been vaccinated with ProQuad should attempt to avoid
close contact, for up to 6 weeks following the vaccination, with anyone who falls into one of the
categories above. Tell your doctor if there is anyone who falls into one of the categories above and is
expected to be in close contact with the person being vaccinated.
As with other vaccines, ProQuad may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. Also, if
the person to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella
virus but is not yet ill, ProQuad may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.
Other medicines and ProQuad
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other
medicines (or other vaccines).
ProQuad can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as Prevenar, and/or hepatitis
A vaccine, or with vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus
influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B. A different place for the injection will be
used for each vaccine.
The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or
administration of immune globulin (IG), or varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG). After
vaccination with ProQuad, IG or VZIG should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you
otherwise. 
If a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with,
or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad.</p>
<p>Tell the doctor if the person to be vaccinated has recently received a vaccine or if one is scheduled to
be given in the near future. The doctor will determine when ProQuad may be given. 
The use of salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used
to relieve pain and lower fever) should be avoided for 6 weeks following vaccination with ProQuad.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
ProQuad should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing age should take the
necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination.
Persons who are breast-feeding or who intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will
decide if ProQuad should be given.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.
ProQuad contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .
ProQuad contains potassium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
 potassium-free .
ProQuad contains sorbitol
This medicine contains 16 mg sorbitol per dose. The additive effect of concomitantly administered
products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken
into account.</p>         </div>"""

individuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site.
If the person to be vaccinated has a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine
should be given under the skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.
ProQuad is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel. 
ProQuad is given by injection as follows: </p>
<p>Infants between 9 and 12 months of age:</p>
<p>ProQuad may be administered from 9 months of age. To ensure optimal protection against
chickenpox and measles, two doses of ProQuad should be given at least three months apart. </p>
<p>Individuals 12 months of age and older:</p>
<p>To ensure optimal protection against chickenpox, two doses of ProQuad should be given at

Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline
cake. The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear
pale yellow to light pink liquid.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other
antiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine.
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission
of infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
ProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines.
Reconstitution instructions</p>
<p>Withdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe
into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely.
The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard
the vaccine.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to
minimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle, and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
See also section 3 How to use ProQuad.</p>
