Pylclari contains the active substance piflufolastat (18F), which contains radioactive fluorine (18F). It is 
given so that doctors can perform a special type of scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) 
scan to detect specific types of cancer cells with a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA). This medicine is used in patients: 
-
with prostate cancer who are at high risk of the disease spreading to other parts of the body and 
who is suitable for treatment which can cure the cancer 
-
have received previous treatment for prostate cancer and in whom the cancer is suspected to have 
returned based on the results from other tests (e.g., prostate specific antigen, PSA). 
Pylclari PET scan can can help your doctor find the locations of the disease. 
You should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. 
The use of Pylclari does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear 
medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with 
the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. </p>         </div>"""

-
if you have kidney problems 
-
if you are on a low sodium diet (see section 2 "Pylclari contains sodium").

Drink plenty of water before the start of the examination in order to urinate as often as possible during 
the first hours after the scan. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not intended for use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Pylclari 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, such as hormonotherapy to treat your prostate cancer, since they may interfere with the 
interpretation of the images.

or 11 mL of wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effect. 
Pylclari contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 35 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. 
This is equivalent to 2 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Pylclari will 
only be used in specially controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by 
people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe 
use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions. 
Recommended dose 
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of this medicine to 
be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. The 
mean recommended amount is 4 MBq/kg of body weight ; it is about 280 megabecquerel for an adult 
of 70 kg (MBq, the unit used to express radioactivity). 
Administration of Pylclari and conduct of the procedure 
-
This medicine will be given as a single injection into a vein in your arm. 
-
One injection is sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. 
Duration of the procedure 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. 
The scan will usually start between 90 and 120 minutes after Pylclari injection is given. 
After administration of Pylclari you should: 
-
avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for the 12 hours following the 
injection 
-
drink plenty of water in order to urinate (pass water) frequently, to eliminate the product from 
your body. 
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. 
If you have been given more Pylclari than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose of Pylclari precisely controlled by 
the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. 
However, in case of an overdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. The nuclear medicine 
doctor in charge of the procedure may provide ways to increase the passing of urine in order to 
facilitate the removal of the medicine from your body. 
Should you have any further question on the use of Pylclari, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""
