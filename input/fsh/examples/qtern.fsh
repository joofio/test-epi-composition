  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Qtern contains the active substances saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. Each belongs to a group of 
medicines called  oral anti-diabetics . These medicines are taken by mouth for diabetes.
Qtern is used for a type of diabetes called  type 2 diabetes mellitus  in adult patients (aged 18 years 
and older). If you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin or your body is 
not able to use the insulin it produces properly. This leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. The 
two active substances in Qtern work in different ways to help control the level of sugar in your blood 
and remove excess sugar from your body via your urine.
Qtern is used to treat type 2 diabetes when:
-
saxagliptin or dapagliflozin alone together with metformin and/or sulphonylurea cannot control 
your diabetes.
-
you are already being treated with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin as single tablets. Your doctor 
may ask you to switch to this medicine. 
It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to saxagliptin, dapagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).
-
if you have had a serious allergic reaction to any other similar medicines (for example DPP-4 
inhibitors like sitagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin, or SGLT2 inhibitors like canagliflozin, 
empagliflozin) that you take to control your blood sugar.
Do not take Qtern if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, 
or nurse before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Qtern, and during treatment:
-
if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas called pancreatitis. Possible signs of 
pancreatitis are listed in section 4. -
if you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history of 
low blood pressure (hypotension). For more information, see section  Other medicines and 
Qtern  below.
-
if you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too 
much body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed at the top of section 4. Tell your 
doctor before you start taking Qtern if you have any of these signs.
-
if you have or develop nausea (feeling sick), vomiting or fever or if you are not able to eat or 
drink. These conditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Qtern 
until you recover to prevent dehydration.
-
if you have moderate or severe liver problem.
-
if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a 
doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic 
ketoacidosis    a rare but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes 
because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of 
developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol 
consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to 
major surgery or serious illness.
-
if you have  type 1 diabetes  your body does not produce any insulin. Qtern should not be used 
to treat this condition.
-
if you have or have had a serious hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction or is suspected. Signs of a 
serious allergic reaction are listed in section 4. -
if you often get infections of the urinary tract.
-
if you have a history of serious heart disease.
-
if you suffer from heart failure or you have other risk factors for developing heart failure such as 
problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will advise you of the signs and symptoms of heart 
failure. Symptoms can include, but are not limited to, increasing shortness of breath, rapid 
increase in weight and swelling of the feet (pedal oedema). You should call your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.
-
if you have severe joint pain.
-
if your body s ability to fight infections is reduced, for example if you have a disease like AIDS 
or have undergone an organ transplant.
-
if you are taking a medicine to lower your blood sugar, such as sulphonylureas (see  Other 
medicines and Qtern ).
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking Qtern.
Diabetic skin lesions (skin damage such as sores or ulcers) are a common complication of diabetes. 
Rash has been seen with both saxagliptin and dapagliflozin when given separately (see section 4). You 
are advised to follow the recommendations for skin care that you are given by your doctor or nurse.
Contact your doctor if you encounter blistering of the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called 
bullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to stop Qtern.
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional.
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling 
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening 
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue 
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Kidney function
Your kidneys should be checked before you start taking Qtern. During treatment with this medicine, 
your doctor will check your kidney function once a year or more frequently if you have worsening 
kidney function.
Urine tests
Because of how Qtern works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this medicine.
Children and adolescents
Qtern is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because it has not been 
studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Qtern
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Especially tell your doctor:
-
if you are taking a medicine used to increase the amount of water you pass out of the body 
(diuretic). Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Qtern. Possible signs of losing too much fluid 
from your body are listed at the top of section 4. -
if you are taking another medicine that lowers the amount of sugar in your blood such as a 
sulphonylurea (for example glimepiride). Your doctor may want to lower the dose of this other 
medicine, to prevent you from getting low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia).
-
if you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances, that might have an 
effect on the breakdown of Qtern in your body. Your doctor may ask you to check your blood 
sugar levels more often while taking these medicines.
-
Carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. These may be used to control fits (seizures) or 
chronic pain.
-
Dexamethasone   a steroid medicine. This may be used to treat inflammation in different
body parts and organs.
-
Rifampicin. This is an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis.
-
Ketoconazole. This may be used to treat fungal infections.
-
Diltiazem. This is a medicine used to treat angina (chest pain) and lower blood pressure.
If any of the above apply to you (or if you are not sure), talk to your doctor before taking Qtern.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Qtern is not recommended during 
pregnancy and your doctor will ask you to stop taking this medicine if you become pregnant. Talk to 
your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant.
You should not use Qtern if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if this medicine passes into human 
breast milk. Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Qtern is not expected to affect you being able to drive a car or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
dizzy while taking this medicine, do not drive or use any tools or machines. Taking this medicine 
together with another medicine that lowers your blood sugar, such as a sulphonylurea, can cause too 
low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). This may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and 
change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Qtern contains lactose
Qtern contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance 
to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Qtern contains sodium
Qtern contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

take other medicine(s) as your doctor has told you. This will help get the best results for your health.
Diet and exercise
To control your diabetes, you still need to keep to diet and exercise, even when you are taking this 
medicine. So it is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise from your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. In particular, if you are following a diabetic weight control diet, continue to 
follow it while you are taking Qtern.
If you take more Qtern than you should
If you take more Qtern tablets than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take 
the medicine pack with you.
If you forget to take Qtern

take your next dose at the usual time.
-
Do not take a double dose of Qtern to make up for a forgotten dose.
