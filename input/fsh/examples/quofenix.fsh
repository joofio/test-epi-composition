  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You must not be given Quofenix: 
* If you are allergic to delafloxacin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* If you are allergic to any other fluoroquinolone or quinolone antibacterial medicine. 
* If you have ever had a problem with your tendons such as tendonitis that was related to 
treatment with a  quinolone antibiotic . A tendon is the cord that joins your muscle to your 
skeleton. 
* If you are pregnant, might become pregnant, or think you might be pregnant. 
* If you are breast-feeding. 
* If you are a child or growing adolescent below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before you are given this medicine 
You should not be given fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including Quofenix, if 
you have experienced any serious adverse reaction in the past when taking a quinolone or 
fluoroquinolone. In this situation, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>When you are given this medicine 
* Pain and swelling in the joints and inflammation or rupture of tendons may occur rarely. Your 
risk is increased if you are elderly (above 60 years of age), have received an organ transplant, 
have kidney problems or if you are being treated with corticosteroids. Inflammation and 
ruptures of tendons may occur within the first 48 hours of treatment and even up to several 
months after stopping Quofenix therapy. At the first sign of pain or inflammation of a tendon 
(for example in your ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder or knee), stop taking Quofenix, contact 
your doctor and rest the painful area. Avoid any unnecessary exercise as this might increase 
the risk of a tendon rupture. 
* You may rarely experience symptoms of nerve damage (neuropathy) such as pain, burning, 
tingling, numbness and/or weakness especially in the feet and legs or hands and arms. If this 
happens, stop taking Quofenix and inform your doctor immediately in order to prevent the 
development of potentially irreversible condition. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before you are given Quofenix if: 
* You have been diagnosed with an enlargement or  bulge  of a large blood vessel (aortic 
aneurysm or large vessel peripheral aneurysm). 
* You have experienced a previous episode of aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta wall). 
* You have been diagnosed with leaking heart valves (heart valve regurgitation). 
* You have a family history of aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection or congenital heart valve 
disease, or other risk factors or predisposing conditions (e. g. connective tissue disorders such 
as Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, Sj gren s syndrome [an 
inflammatory autoimmune disease], or vascular disorders such as Takayasu arteritis, giant 
cell arteritis, Behcet s disease, high blood pressure, or known atherosclerosis, rheumatoid 
arthritis [a disease of the joints] or endocarditis [an infection of the heart] ). 
* You have had tendon problems during previous treatment with a fluoroquinolone or 
quinolone antibiotic. 
* You have or may have problems with the central nervous system (e.g. severe cerebral 
arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or have other risk factors that may put you at more risk of having 
seizures (fits). In those cases your doctor will consider if this treatment is the best option for 
you. 
* You have a myasthenia gravis (a type of muscle weakness), because symptoms can become 
worse. 
* You are suffering from diarrhoea, or have previously suffered from diarrhoea while taking 
antibiotics or up to 2 months afterwards. Contact your doctor straight away if you have 
diarrhoea during or after your treatment. Do not take any medicine to treat your diarrhoea 
without first checking with your doctor. 
* You have kidney problems. 
* You had sometimes long treatment with antibiotics; it can mean that you get another infection 
caused by other bacteria (superinfection) which cannot be treated by the antibiotic. Talk to 
your doctor if you have any concerns or questions about this and using Quofenix. 
* You may have a severe skin reaction such as blistering or lesion. 
* You or a member of your family is known to have a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase. 
* You have diabetes. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including Quofenix, may cause levels of 
glucose in the blood to rise too high or fall too low. If you have diabetes, you should monitor 
your blood glucose levels carefully. </p>
<p>If you feel sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, chest or back, which can be symptoms of aortic 
aneurysm and dissection, go immediately to an emergency room. Your risk may be increased if you 
are being treated with systemic corticosteroids. </p>
<p>If you start experiencing a rapid onset of shortness of breath, especially when you lie down flat in your 
bed, or you notice swelling of your ankles, feet or abdomen, or a new onset of heart palpitations 
(sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeat), you should inform a doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious side effects 
Fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines have been associated with very rare but serious 
side effects, some of them being long lasting (continuing months or years), disabling or potentially 
irreversible. This includes tendon, muscle and joint pain of the upper and lower limbs, difficulty in 
walking, abnormal sensations such as pins and needles, tingling, tickling, numbness or burning 
(paraesthesia), sensory disorders including impairment of vision, taste and smell, and hearing, 
depression, memory impairment, severe fatigue, and severe sleep disorders. 
If you experience any of these side effects after receiving Quofenix, contact your doctor immediately 
prior to continuing treatment. You and your doctor will decide on continuing the treatment considering 
also an antibiotic from another class. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine must not be used in children and adolescents, as it has not been studied enough in these 
groups. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Quofenix 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
There are no data concerning an interaction of intravenous delafloxacin with multivitamins, other 
supplements or didanosine. However, Quofenix should not be given together with any solution 
containing substances such as calcium and magnesium, through the same intravenous line. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Quofenix must not be used if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Quofenix must not be used in women 
of childbearing potential not using contraception. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell 
your doctor before you are given this medicine. 
If you might become pregnant you have to use effective contraception during treatment with 
Quofenix. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Quofenix can make you feel dizzy and lightheaded. Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other 
activities that require mental alertness or coordination until you know how Quofenix affects you.  </p>
<p>Quofenix contains cyclodextrin 
This medicine contains 2480 mg of sulfobutylbetadex sodiumin each vial. </p>
<p>Quofenix contains sodium 
This medicine contains 175 mg of sodium (main component of cooking salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 8.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""
