combination with other medicines for the treatment of pain.
Qutenza is used to relieve pain in people who have nerve pain due to damaged nerves in the skin. 
Damaged nerves in your skin may occur as a result of a variety of diseases such as shingles, HIV 
infection, diabetes, certain medicines and other conditions. You may experience pain relief between 1

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using Qutenza
Do not use Qutenza on any part of your head or face.
Do not use Qutenza on broken skin or open wounds.
Do not touch Qutenza or other materials that have come in contact with the treated areas as it may 
cause burning and stinging. Do not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas as it may cause 
irritation and pain. If this happens, flush or rinse with cold water. Sniffing or inhaling close to the 
Qutenza patches may cause coughing, throat irritation or sneezing.
It is usual for the skin to sting or become red and burn during and after Qutenza treatment for a short 
while. Because of the pain, your blood pressure may go up and therefore, your doctor will measure 
your blood pressure several times during your treatment. If you experience a lot of pain, your doctor 
will apply local cooling or give you medicine for pain. If you experience very severe pain, ask your 
doctor to remove the patch. 
Generally small, short-term changes in the ability to feel when something is hot or sharp have been 
seen after use of capsaicin.
If you have unstable or poorly controlled high blood pressure or had heart problems, your doctor will 
consider the risk of side effects to your heart or blood pressure due to the potential stress of the 
procedure before treating you with Qutenza.
Children and adolescents
Qutenza is not recommended for treatment in patients under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Qutenza
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Qutenza acts 
locally on your skin and is not expected to influence other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Qutenza should be used with caution if you are pregnant. You should discontinue breastfeeding before 
treatment with Qutenza is started. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or 
are planning to have a baby ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
There are no studies of the effects of Qutenza on the ability to drive and use machines. When using 
Qutenza, only very small amounts of the active substance may be present in the blood stream for a 
very short time. Therefore, Qutenza is unlikely to have any direct effects on your ability to concentrate
or your ability to drive or use machinery.
Cleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole
The cleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. 
contact dermatitis), or irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Qutenza should only be applied by your doctor or by a nurse under the supervision of your doctor.
No more than 4 patches should be used at the same time.
Qutenza is for use on your skin.
Your doctor or nurse will mark the most painful areas on your skin with a pen or marker.
Before placing the Qutenza patches on the skin, the treatment area(s) will be washed with soap and 
water and dried. Hair in treatment areas will be clipped.
Before placing the Qutenza patches on the skin, your doctor or nurse may apply a numbing gel or 
cream or give you an oral pain medicine to reduce potential stinging. The gel or cream should be 
removed prior to applying Qutenza and the skin washed and dried thoroughly.
Your doctor or nurse may wear gloves, and sometimes a mask and protective glasses, while handling
the Qutenza patches. Do not sniff or inhale close to the Qutenza patches as this may cause coughing or 
sneezing. 
Qutenza may be cut into smaller pieces to fit the treatment area. Your doctor or nurse will remove the 
patches after 30 minutes if you re being treated for nerve pain on your feet or 60 minutes if you re 
being treated for nerve pain on other parts of your body.
It may take between 1 to 3 weeks before you experience pain relief with Qutenza. If after that time you 
still have a lot of pain, please talk to your doctor.
Qutenza therapy may be repeated at 90-day intervals, if necessary. If you experience insufficient pain 
relief or pain returns earlier, please consult your doctor.
You may be given pain medicines to take for the pain you experience with Qutenza therapy.
It is common for the skin to sting or become red and burn during Qutenza treatment.
Disposable socks may be worn on top of the Qutenza patches if your feet are being treated.
Sometimes your doctor or nurse may put a bandage on top of the Qutenza patch to keep the patch 
firmly on your skin.
Do not attempt to remove the patch yourself. Your doctor or nurse will remove it for you.
At the end of the Qutenza treatment your doctor or nurse will clean the treated skin with cleansing gel 
from a tube supplied with the kit. Cleansing gel will be left on your skin for one minute and then 
wiped off to remove any remaining medicine that may be left on your skin after treatment. After the 
cleansing gel has been wiped off, the area will be gently washed with soap and water.
Do not touch the patch with your hands.
Do not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas. If you accidentally touch the Qutenza patch 
or treated skin before cleansing gel is applied it may burn and/or sting. Call your doctor immediately.
Do not take Qutenza patches away from the clinic.
Do not use Qutenza patches at home.
If Qutenza is used longer than it should
Overdosing is unlikely to occur. However, if Qutenza is applied longer than it should you might 
experience severe application site reactions like pain, redness and itching.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist</p>         </div>"""
