Ranivisio is a solution which is injected into the eye. Ranivisio belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab.  </p>
<p>What Ranivisio is used for<br />
Ranivisio is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment.  </p>
<p>These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels. This is observed in diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, a disease caused by 
diabetes). It may also be associated with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic 
myopia (PM), angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy or inflammatory CNV.  </li>
<li>Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused by diabetes 
(a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of retinal veins of the 
retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)).  </li>
</ul>
<p>How Ranivisio works<br />
Ranivisio specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and 
swelling in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like AMD,<br />
DME, PDR, RVO, PM and CNV. By binding to VEGF-A, Ranivisio can block its actions and prevent 
this abnormal growth and swelling.  </p>
<p>In these diseases, Ranivisio can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to ranibizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).<br />
- If you have an infection in or around your eye.<br />
- If you have pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in your eye.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before you are given Ranivisio.<br />
- Ranivisio is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion 
of the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of 
the eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or 
clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur after Ranivisio treatment. It is important to identify 
and treat such an infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell your doctor 
immediately if you develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision or 
increased sensitivity to light.<br />
- In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
This is something you may not notice, therefore your doctor may monitor this after each 
injection.<br />
- Inform your doctor if you have a prior history of eye conditions or eye treatments, or if you 
have had a stroke or experienced transient signs of stroke (weakness or paralysis of limbs or 
face, difficulty speaking or understanding). This information will be taken into account to 
evaluate if Ranivisio is the appropriate treatment for you.  </p>
<p>Please see section 4 ( Possible side effects ) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Ranivisio therapy.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (below 18 years of age)<br />
The use of Ranivisio in children and adolescents has not been established and is therefore not 
recommended.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ranivisio 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
- Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least three further months after the last injection of Ranivisio.<br />
- There is no experience of using Ranivisio in pregnant women. Ranivisio should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If 
you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with 
your doctor before treatment with Ranivisio.<br />
- Small amounts of Ranivisio may pass into breast milk, therefore Ranivisio is not recommended 
during breast-feeding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before Ranivisio treatment.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
After Ranivisio treatment you may experience some temporary vision blurring. If this happens, do not 
drive or use machines until this resolves. </p>         </div>"""

be administered by your eye doctor.  </p>
<p>Before the injection, your doctor will wash your eye carefully to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection.  </p>
<p>The treatment is started with one injection of Ranivisio per month. Your doctor will monitor the 
condition of your eye and, depending on how you respond to the treatment, will decide if and when
