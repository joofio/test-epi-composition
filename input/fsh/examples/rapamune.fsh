immunosuppressants. It helps to control your body s immune system after you have received a kidney 
transplant.
Rapamune is used in adults to prevent your body from rejecting transplanted kidneys and is normally 
used with other immunosuppressant medicines called corticosteroids and initially (the first 2 to 
3 months) with ciclosporin.
Rapamune is also used for the treatment of patients with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis
(S-LAM) with moderate lung disease or declining lung function. S-LAM is a rare progressive lung 
disease that affects predominantly women of childbearing age. The most common symptom of S-LAM

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rapamune</p>
<p>If you have any liver problems or have had a disease which may have affected your liver, please 
tell your doctor as this may affect the dose of Rapamune that you receive and may result in your 
having additional blood tests.</p>
<p>Rapamune, like other immunosuppressive medicines, may decrease your body s ability to fight 
infection, and may increase the risk of developing cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.</p>
<p>If you have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2, you may be at increased risk of 
abnormal wound healing.</p>
<p>If you are considered to be at high risk for kidney rejection, such as if you had a previous 
transplant that was lost to rejection.
Your doctor will perform tests to monitor the levels of Rapamune in your blood. Your doctor will also 
perform tests to monitor your kidney function, your blood fat (cholesterol and/or triglycerides) levels
and possibly your liver function, during treatment with Rapamune.
Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by covering your skin with clothing and using a 
sunscreen with a high protection factor because of the increased risk for skin cancer.
Children and adolescents
There is limited experience on the use of Rapamune in children and adolescents less than 18 years of 
age. The use of Rapamune is not recommended in this population.
Other medicines and Rapamune
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Some medicines can interfere with the action of Rapamune and, therefore, dose adjustment of 
Rapamune may be required. In particular, you should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
taking any of the following:</p>
<p>any other immunosuppressant medicines.</p>
<p>antibiotics or antifungal medicines used to treat infection e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin, 
telithromycin, troleandomycin, rifabutin, clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole. It is not 
recommended that Rapamune be taken with rifampicin, ketoconazole or voriconazole. </p>
<p>any high blood pressure medicines or medicines for heart problems including nicardipine, 
verapamil and diltiazem.</p>
<p>anti-epileptic medicines including carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin.</p>
<p>medicines used to treat ulcers or other gastrointestinal disorders such as cisapride, cimetidine, 
metoclopramide.</p>
<p>bromocriptine (used in the treatment of Parkinson s disease and various hormonal disorders), 
danazol (used in the treatment of gynaecological disorders), or protease inhibitors (e.g. for HIV 
and hepatitis C such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir).</p>
<p>St. John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</p>
<p>letermovir (an antiviral medicine to prevent getting ill from cytomegalovirus).</p>
<p>cannabidiol (uses amongst others include treatment of seizures).
The use of live vaccines should be avoided with the use of Rapamune. Before vaccinations, please 
inform your doctor or pharmacist that you are receiving Rapamune. 
The use of Rapamune may lead to increased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (blood fats) in your 
blood that may require treatment. Medicines known as  statins  and  fibrates  used to treat elevated 
cholesterol and triglycerides have been associated with an increased risk of muscle breakdown 
(rhabdomyolysis). Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines to lower your blood fats.
The combined use of Rapamune with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (a type of 
medicine used to lower blood pressure) may result in allergic reactions. Please inform your doctor if 
you are taking any of these medicines.
Rapamune with food and drink
Rapamune should be taken consistently, either with or without food. If you prefer to take Rapamune 
with food, then you should always take it with food. If you prefer to take Rapamune without food, 
then you should always take it without food. Food can affect the amount of medicine that gets into 
your bloodstream, and taking your medicine in a consistent way means that the blood levels of 
Rapamune remain more stable.
Rapamune should not be taken with grapefruit juice.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
Rapamune should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. You must use an effective 
method of contraception during treatment with Rapamune and for 12 weeks after treatment has 
stopped. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is not known whether Rapamune passes into breast milk. Patients taking Rapamune should 
discontinue breast-feeding.
Decreased sperm count has been associated with the use of Rapamune and usually returns to normal 
once treatment is stopped.
Driving and using machines
Although Rapamune treatment is not expected to affect your ability to drive, if you have any concerns 
please consult your doctor.
Rapamune contains ethanol (alcohol)
Rapamune contains up to 3.17 vol % ethanol (alcohol). An initial dose of 6 mg contains up to 150 mg 
of alcohol which is equivalent to 3.80 mL beer or 1.58 mL wine. This amount of alcohol may be 
harmful for those suffering from alcoholism as well as for pregnant or breast-feeding women, children
and high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. Alcohol may modify or increase 
the effect of other medicines.
Maintenance doses of 4 mg or less contain small amounts of ethanol (100 mg or less) that are likely to 
be too low to be harmful.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.
Your doctor will decide exactly what dose of Rapamune you must take and how often to take it. 
Follow your doctor s instructions exactly, and never change the dose yourself.
Rapamune is for oral use only. Inform your doctor if you have difficulty taking the oral solution.
Rapamune should be taken consistently, either with or without food.
Kidney Transplant
Your doctor will give you an initial dose of 6 mg as soon as possible after the kidney transplant 
operation. Then you will need to take 2 mg of Rapamune each day, until otherwise directed by your 
doctor. Your dose will be adjusted depending on the level of Rapamune in your blood. Your doctor 
will need to perform blood tests to measure Rapamune concentrations. 
If you are also taking ciclosporin, then you must take the two medicines approximately 4 hours apart.
It is recommended that Rapamune be used first in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids.
After 3 months, your doctor may discontinue either Rapamune or ciclosporin, as it is not 
recommended that these medicines be taken together beyond this period. 
Sporadic Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (S-LAM)
Your doctor will give you 2 mg of Rapamune each day, until otherwise directed by your doctor. Your 
dose will be adjusted depending on the level of Rapamune in your blood. Your doctor will need to 
perform blood tests to measure Rapamune concentrations.
Instructions on how to dilute Rapamune
1. Remove the safety cap from the bottle by squeezing the tabs on the cap and twisting. Insert the 
syringe adapter into the bottle until it is flush with the top of the bottle. Do not attempt to 
remove the syringe adapter from the bottle once inserted.
2. With the plunger fully depressed, insert one of the dosing syringes into the opening in the 
adapter.
3. Withdraw the exact amount of Rapamune oral solution as prescribed by your doctor by gently 
pulling out the plunger of the dosing syringe until the level of the oral solution is even with the 
appropriate mark on the dosing syringe. The bottle should remain in an upright position when 
withdrawing the solution. If bubbles form in the oral solution in the dosing syringe during 
withdrawal, empty the Rapamune solution back into the bottle and repeat the withdrawal 
procedure. You may need to repeat step 3 more than once to deliver your dose.
4. You may have been instructed to take your Rapamune oral solution at a particular time of day. If 
it is necessary to carry your medication with you, fill the dosing syringe to the appropriate mark 
and place a cap securely on it   the cap should snap into place. Then place the capped dosing 
syringe in the carrying case provided. Once in the syringe the medication may be kept at room 
temperature (not exceeding 25 C) or refrigerated and should be used within 24 hours.</p>
<ol>
<li>Empty the contents of the dosing syringe into only a glass or plastic container holding at least 
60 mL of water or orange juice. Stir well for one minute and drink immediately at once. Refill the 
glass with at least 120 mL of water or orange juice, stir well, and drink immediately. No other 
liquids, including grapefruit juice, should be used for dilution. The dosing syringe and cap are to 
be used once and then discarded. 
When refrigerated the solution in the bottle may develop a slight haze. If this occurs, simply bring 
your Rapamune oral solution to room temperature and shake gently. The presence of this haze does 
not affect the quality of Rapamune.
If you take more Rapamune than you should
If you have taken more medicine than you were told contact a doctor or go to the nearest hospital 
emergency department straight away. Always take the labelled medicine bottle with you, even if it is 
empty.
If you forget to take Rapamune
If you forget to take Rapamune, take it as soon as you remember, but not within 4 hours of the next 
dose of ciclosporin. After that, continue to take your medicines as usual. Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose, and always take Rapamune and ciclosporin approximately 4 hours apart. 
If you miss a dose of Rapamune completely, you should inform your doctor.
If you stop taking Rapamune
Do not stop taking Rapamune unless your doctor tells you to, as you risk losing your transplant.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</li>

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Allergic reactions
You should see your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms, such as swollen face, tongue 
and/or back of the mouth (pharynx) and/or difficulties in breathing (angioedema), or a skin condition 
whereby the skin can peel off (exfoliative dermatitis). These may be symptoms of a serious allergic 
reaction. 
Kidney damage with low blood cell counts (thrombocytopaenic purpura/haemolytic uraemic 
syndrome)
When taken with medicines called calcineurin inhibitors (ciclosporin or tacrolimus), Rapamune may 
increase the risk of kidney damage with low blood platelets and low red blood cell counts, with or 
without rash (thrombocytopaenic purpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome). If you experience 
symptoms, such as bruising or rash, changes in your urine, or changes in behaviour, or any others that 
are serious, unusual or prolonged, contact your doctor.
Infections
Rapamune reduces your body s own defence mechanisms. Consequently your body will not be as 
good as normal at fighting infections. So if you are taking Rapamune, you may therefore catch more 
infections than usual, such as infections of the skin, mouth, stomach and intestines, lungs and urinary 
tract (see list below). You should contact your doctor if you experience symptoms that are serious,
unusual, or prolonged.
