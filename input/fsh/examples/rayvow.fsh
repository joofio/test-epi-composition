- if you are allergic to lasmiditan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Do not take part in activities requiring your full attention, such as driving or operating machinery, 
within 8 hours of taking each dose of RAYVOW, even if you feel well enough to do so, because it can 
affect your ability to drive or operate machinery safely. If you cannot do this, you should not take 
RAYVOW. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking RAYVOW if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>are taking medicines that increase the level of serotonin (see  Other medicines and RAYVOW ). 
These medicines increase the risk of side effects such as serotonin syndrome (a rare reaction 
which may cause mental changes, such as seeing things that are not there (hallucinations), 
agitation, or coma; fast heartbeat; changes in blood pressure; high body temperature; tight 
muscles; trouble walking; nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea).  </li>
<li>are taking other medicines or substances that cause sleepiness such as sleeping pills, medicines 
for psychiatric conditions, or alcohol </li>
<li>have ever been addicted to prescription medicines, alcohol, or other drugs.  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you repeatedly use any medicines for the treatment of migraine over several days or weeks, this can 
cause long-term daily headaches. Tell your doctor if you experience this as you might need to stop 
treatment for a while. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
RAYVOW should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because there is not enough 
information about how it works in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and RAYVOW 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking RAYVOW if you are taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines that lower heart rate, such as propranolol </li>
<li>medicines that increase the level of serotonin (including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic 
antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], or triptans) </li>
<li>digoxin (used to treat heart disorders) </li>
</ul>
<p>RAYVOW with alcohol 
Care should be taken if you drink alcohol while taking RAYVOW. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. It is not known if RAYVOW will harm your unborn baby. 
RAYVOW is not recommended during pregnancy. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It is not known if 
lasmiditan passes into your breastmilk. It is recommended to avoid breast-feeding for 24 hours after 
treatment in order to minimise the amount of lasmiditan that is passed onto your baby.   </p>
<p>It is not known whether RAYVOW affects your fertility.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
RAYVOW affects your ability to drive and use machines. Do not take part in activities requiring your 
full attention, such as driving or operating machinery, for at least 8 hours after taking each dose of 
lasmiditan, even if you feel well enough to do so. If you cannot do this, you should not take 
RAYVOW.  </p>
<p>RAYVOW contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say it is essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<li>The recommended starting dose is 100 mg lasmiditan. Your doctor will decide which dose of 
lasmiditan is appropriate for you.  </li>
<li>If you do not become pain free after the first tablet, do not take a second tablet for the same 
attack as it is unlikely to be effective.  </li>
<li>If after a first tablet of 50 mg or 100 mg your migraine is completely resolved and then comes 
back, you may take a second tablet of the same strength no sooner than 2 hours after the first 
dose.  </li>
<li>You should not take more than 200 mg within 24 hours.  </li>

</ul>
<p>Use in children and adolescents and patients with liver impairment 
RAYVOW is not recommended in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age), or in patients 
with severe liver problems. </p>
<p>Route of administration 
RAYVOW is for oral use. You should swallow your tablet with a drink of water during the headache 
phase of your migraine attack. You can take the tablet either with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more RAYVOW than you should 
If you take more RAYVOW than you should, immediately contact your doctor. You may get some of 
the side effects described in section 4. If you forget to take RAYVOW 
RAYVOW is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches and should only be taken when 
necessary.  </p>
