thoughts and behaviours are more likely at the beginning of the treatment. </li>
<li>if you experience a combination of fever, sweating, faster breathing, muscle stiffness and 
drowsiness or sleepiness (may be signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome). </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Reagila, or during treatment if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>ever experienced or start to experience restlessness and inability to sit still. These symptoms 
may occur early during treatment with Reagila. Tell your doctor if this happens. </li>
<li>ever experienced or start to experience abnormal, involuntary movements, most commonly of 
the tongue or face. Tell your doctor if this happens. </li>
<li>visual impairment. Your doctor will advise you to visit an ophthalmologist. </li>
<li>irregular heartbeat or if someone else in your family has a history of irregular heartbeat 
(including so called QT prolongation seen with ECG monitoring), and tell your doctor if you are 
taking other medicines, because they might cause or worsen this ECG change. </li>
<li>high or low blood pressure, cardiovascular disease. Your doctor will need to check your blood 
pressure regularly. </li>
<li>dizziness on standing up due to a drop in your blood pressure, which may cause fainting </li>
<li>a history of blood clots, or if someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as 
medicines for schizophrenia have been associated with formation of blood clots. </li>

<li>if you have diabetes or risk factors for diabetes (e.g. obesity, or someone else in your family has

by Reagila. Signs of high blood sugar level are excessive thirst, passing of large amounts of 
urine, increase in appetite and feeling weak. </li>
<li>a history of seizures (fits) or epilepsy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Weight increase 
Reagila may cause significant weight increase which may affect your health. Your doctor will 
therefore check your weight regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data 
in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Reagila 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. You cannot take certain medicines together with Reagila (see section  Do not take 
Reagila ). </p>
<p>Taking Reagila together with some medicines may require a dose adjustment of Reagila or the other 
medicine. These are medicines used to treat heart diseases containing digoxin, blood thinners 
containing dabigatran, or medicines affecting your mental functions. </p>
<p>Reagila with food, drink and alcohol 
You should not drink grapefruit juice during treatment with Reagila. 
Alcohol should be avoided when taking Reagila. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during Reagila treatment. Even 
after treatment is stopped, contraception must be used for at least 10 weeks after your last dose of 
Reagila. This is because the medicine will stay in your body for some time after the last dose was 
taken. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not take this medicine during pregnancy unless your doctor has told you to do so. </p>
<p>If your doctor decides that you should take this medicine during pregnancy, your doctor will monitor 
your baby closely after birth. This is because the following symptoms may occur in newborn babies of 
mothers who have used this medicine in the last trimester (last three months) of their pregnancy:</p>
<ul>
<li>shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and 
difficulty in feeding. 
If your baby develops any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed if you are taking Reagila because a risk for the baby cannot be excluded. Contact 
your doctor for advice.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There is a minor or moderate risk that the medicine could affect the ability to drive and use machines. 
Drowsiness, dizziness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see section 
4). Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know that this medicine does not affect you in 
a negative way. </p>
<p>Reagila 3 mg, 4.5 mg, 6 mg hard capsules contain Allura red AC (E 129). 
Allura red AC is a coloring agent, which may cause allergic reactions. </p>         </div>"""

The maximum dose should not exceed 6 mg once a day. </p>
<p>Take Reagila at the same time each day with or without food. </p>
<p>If you were taking another medicine to treat schizophrenia before starting Reagila, your doctor will 
decide whether to stop the other medicine gradually or immediately and how to adjust the dose of 
Reagila. Your doctor will also inform you how to act if you switch from Reagila to another medicine. </p>
<p>Patients with kidney or liver problems 
If you have serious kidney or liver problems Reagila may not be appropriate for you. Talk to your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Elderly patients 
Your doctor will carefully select the appropriate dose for your needs. 
Reagila should not be used by elderly patients with dementia (loss of memory). </p>
<p>If you take more Reagila than you should 
If you have taken more Reagila than your doctor has recommended or if, for example, a child has 
taken it by mistake, contact your doctor or go to the nearest hospital right away and take the pack of 
the medicine with you. You may experience dizziness from low blood pressure, or have abnormal 
heartbeats, you may feel sleepy, tired, or have abnormal body movements and find it difficult to stand 
or walk. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Reagila 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your 
next dose, skip the missed dose and continue as usual. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you miss two or more doses, contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Reagila 
If you stop taking this medicine you will lose the effects of the medicine. Even if you feel better, do 
not alter or stop your daily dose of Reagila unless told to do so by your doctor as your symptoms may 
return. </p>
