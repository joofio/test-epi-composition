system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of 
the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  </p>
<p>Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced 
in the human body. </p>
<p>Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the 
severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. </p>
<ul>
<li>Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. </li>
<li>Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under  How to use 
Rebif  in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue 
destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling 
local reactions, contact your doctor. </li>
<li>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) 
to any other medicines. </li>
<li>Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your 
doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your 
kidney. </li>
</ul>
<p>Inform your doctor if you have a disease of<br />
<em> the bone marrow,<br />
</em> kidney,<br />
<em> liver,<br />
</em> heart,<br />
<em> thyroid, 
* or if you have experienced depression,<br />
</em> or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,<br />
so that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rebif 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-
feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. </p>
<p>Rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>
<p>This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. </p>
<p>Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 
 gasping syndrome ) in young children.  </p>
<p>Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your 
doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called  metabolic acidosis ). </p>         </div>"""

sure. </p>
<p>Dose 
The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. Your doctor has 
prescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week. This lower 
dose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose. </p>
<p>Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: 
* on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) 
* at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). </p>
<p>Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some 
clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 
22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   </p>
<p>Use in children (below 2 years of age) 
Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. 
The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare 
professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use Rebif 
syringes to administer the medicine at home. It may also be administered with a suitable auto-injector. </p>
<p>For administration of Rebif, please read the following instructions carefully: 
This medicine is for single use. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible 
signs of deterioration should be used. </p>
<p>How to inject Rebif </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the 
possible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs 
and the lower abdomen). Hold the syringe like a pencil or 
dart. It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your 
injection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently 
in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. 
NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm 
knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional 
about anything you find. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. </p>
</li>
<li>Remove the Rebif syringe from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. </li>
<li>
<p>Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. 
If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a 
bit). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at 
a right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the 
plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold a swab on the injection site. Remove the needle from 
the skin. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. </p>
</li>
<li>Dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the 
syringe in an appropriate disposal unit. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more Rebif than you should 
In case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Rebif 
If you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Rebif 
The effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but 
continue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please 
consult your doctor.  </p>
<p>You should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious 
side effects: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration 
you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of 
face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or 
faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are 
rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a 
liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, 
loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver 
problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and 
confusion. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple 
sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your 
doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea 
are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). 
These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease 
with continued use. 
To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller 
before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin 
breakdown are very common.<br />
The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.<br />
Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 
1 in 100 people). 
See recommendations in section  Warnings and precautions  to minimise the risk of injection 
site reactions. 
The injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and 
hard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact 
your doctor for advice. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient 
(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular 
treatment. 
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually 
(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could 
include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.<br />
Liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been 
reported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of 
appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact 
your doctor immediately (see above  Tell your doctor immediately... ). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or 
insufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as 
symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your 
treatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis 
relapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from 
moving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like 
symptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other possible side effects include: </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
* Headache </p>

<p>Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
* Suicide attempt 
* Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 
* Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased 
bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your 
doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. 
* Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may 
include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs 
such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks 
after treatment is stopped. 
* Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. 
If you get some or all of these symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>foamy urine  </li>
<li>fatigue  </li>
<li>swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. 
Tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following side effects were reported for interferon beta (frequency not known) 
* Dizziness<br />
<em> Nervousness 
* Loss of appetite 
* Dilatation of the blood vessels and palpitation<br />
</em> Irregularities and/or changes in menstrual flow. 
* Pulmonary arterial hypertension - a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs 
resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension has been seen at various time points during treatment, 
including several years after starting treatment with Rebif. 
* Inflammation of the fatty tissue under the skin (panniculitis), which can make the skin feel hard 
and possibly develop painful red lumps or patches. </p>
<p>You should not stop or alter the medication without your doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Children and teenagers 
Side effects in children and teenagers are similar to those observed in adults. </p>
