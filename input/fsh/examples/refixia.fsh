Refixia contains the active substance nonacog beta pegol. It is a long-acting version of factor IX. 
Factor IX is a protein naturally found in the blood that helps to stop bleeding.  </p>
<p>What Refixia is used for<br />
Refixia is used to treat and prevent bleeding in all age groups of patients with haemophilia B (inborn 
factor IX deficiency).  </p>
<p>In patients with haemophilia B, factor IX is missing or does not work properly. Refixia replaces this 
faulty or missing factor IX and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding.  </p>         </div>"""

in section 6).<br />
</em> if you are allergic to hamster proteins.  </p>
<p>If you are not sure if either of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Traceability<br />
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Refixia. So, every time you get a new 
package of Refixia, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after Lot) 
and keep this information in a safe place.  </p>
<p>Allergic reactions and development of inhibitors<br />
There is a rare risk that you may experience a sudden and severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactic 
reaction) to Refixia. Stop the injection and contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if 
you have signs of an allergic reaction such as rash, hives, weals, itching of large areas of skin, redness 
and/or swelling of lips, tongue, face or hands, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, shortness of 
breath, wheezing, tightness of the chest, pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, and/or dizziness.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to treat you promptly for these reactions. Your doctor may also carry out a 
blood test to check if you have developed factor IX inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against your 
medicine, as inhibitors may develop together with allergic reactions. If you have such inhibitors, you 
may have a higher risk of sudden and severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) during 
future treatment with factor IX.  </p>
<p>Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, your initial treatment with Refixia should be 
given in a medical clinic or in the presence of health care professionals where proper medical care for 
allergic reactions can be provided if needed.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected or if you have to 
significantly increase the amount of Refixia you need to stop a bleed. Your doctor will do a blood test 
to check if you have developed inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against Refixia. The risk for 
developing inhibitors is highest in people who have have not been treated with factor IX medicines 
before, typically small children.  </p>
<p>Blood clots<br />
Tell your doctor, if any of the following apply to you as there is an increased risk of blood clots during 
treatment with Refixia:<br />
* you have recently had surgery 
* you suffer from other serious illness e.g. liver disease, heart disease, or cancer 
* you have risk factors for heart disease e.g high blood pressure, obesity, or smoking. </p>
<p>Kidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome)<br />
There is a rare risk of developing a specific kidney disorder called  nephrotic syndrome  following 
high doses of factor IX in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic 
reactions.  </p>
<p>Catheter-related problems<br />
If you have a central venous access device (CVAD), you may develop infections or blood clots at the 
site of the catheter.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Refixia<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using Refixia.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Refixia has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>Refixia contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . In case of treatment with multiple vials, the total sodium content should be taken into 
consideration.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Your doctor will calculate the right dose for you. The dose will depend on your weight and what the 
medicine is being used for.  </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding<br />
The usual dose of Refixia is 40 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. This is given as one 
injection every week. Your doctor may choose another dose or change how often the injections should 
be given, based on your need.  </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding<br />
The usual dose of Refixia is 40 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. Depending on the 
location and the severity of bleeding you may need a higher dose (80 IU per kg) or extra injections. 
Discuss with your doctor the dose and number of injections you need.  </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents<br />
Refixia can be used  in children and adolescents of all ages. The dose in children and adolescents is 
also calculated according to body weight and is the same dose as for adults.  </p>
<p>How Refixia is given<br />
Refixia is available as powder and solvent that is made up into a solution (reconstitution) and given as 
an injection into a vein. See  Instructions on how to use Refixia  for more information.  </p>
<p>If you use more Refixia than you should<br />
If you use more Refixia than you should, contact your doctor.  </p>

immediately. For further information, see section 2  Allergic reactions and development of inhibitors .  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Refixia<br />
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do not inject a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. If you are in doubt contact your doctor.  </p>
<p>If you stop using Refixia<br />
If you stop using Refixia you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not 
stop. Do not stop using Refixia without talking to your doctor.  </p>
