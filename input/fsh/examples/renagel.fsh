and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood. </p>
<p>Renagel is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on 
haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment.  </p>
<p>Adult patients whose kidneys have failed and who are undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis 
are not able to control the level of serum phosphate in their blood. The amount of phosphate then rises 
(your doctor will call this hyperphosphataemia). Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to hard 
deposits in your body called calcification. These deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and make it 
harder for blood to be pumped around the body. Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy 
skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. </p>
<p>Renagel may be used with other medicines which include calcium or vitamin D supplements to control 
the development of renal bone disease. </p>         </div>"""

* if you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you).

* if you are allergic to sevelamer or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Renagel if any of the following applies to you: 
  if you are not on dialysis 
  if you have swallowing problems 
  if you have problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel 
  if you have symptoms of delayed emptying of stomach contents such as feeling of fullness, 
nausea and/or vomiting<br />
  if you have prolonged diarrhoea or pain in the abdomen (symptoms of active inflammatory 
bowel disease) 
  if you have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor while taking Renagel: 
  if you experience severe abdominal pain, stomach or intestine disorders, or blood in the stool 
(gastrointestinal bleeding). These symptoms can be due to serious inflammatory bowel disease 
caused by sevelamer crystals deposit in your bowel. Contact your doctor who will decide on 
continuing the treatment or not. </p>
<p>Additional treatments: 
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: 
  develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood. Since Renagel does not contain calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
  have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels 
of vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in 
your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental 
vitamins as necessary. </p>
<p>Changing treatment: 
When you switch from another phosphate binder to Renagel, your doctor might consider monitoring 
the levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Renagel may decrease the levels of 
bicarbonate. </p>
<p>Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal 
dialysis. This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You 
should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal 
distress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, 
constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. 
You should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, 
K and folic acid. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) has not been studied. Therefore 
Renagel is not recommended for use in this population. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Renagel 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Renagel should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). </p>
<p>If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your 
doctor when taking Renagel. </p>
<p>The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus 
(medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Renagel. Your doctor will advise 
you if you are taking these medicines. </p>
<p>In certain people taking levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and Renagel, increased levels of 
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, a substance in your blood which helps control your body s 
chemical functions) may very rarely be observed. Therefore your doctor may monitor the 
levels of TSH in your blood more closely. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are taking medicine such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole to treat heartburn, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or gastric ulcers, you should consult your doctor when 
taking Renagel. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will check for interactions between Renagel and other medicines on a regular basis. </p>
<p>In some cases where Renagel should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor may 
advise you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renagel intake, or he/she may consider 
monitoring the blood levels of that medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and  breast-feeding 
The safety of Renagel has not been established in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Renagel should 
only be given to pregnant or breast-feeding women if clearly needed. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Renagel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>         </div>"""

for adults and the elderly (&gt;65 years) is two to four tablets with each meal 3 times a day. </p>
<p>Initially your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood every 2-3 weeks and  may adjust 
the dose of Renagel when necessary (between 1 and 10 tablets of 400 mg per meal) to reach an 
adequate phosphate level. </p>
