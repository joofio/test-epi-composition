produce more insulin and thereby lower your blood sugar (glucose).
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the sugar 
in your blood or where your body does not respond normally to the insulin it produces.
Repaglinide Krka is used to control type 2 diabetes in adults as an add-on to diet and exercise: 
treatment is usually started if diet, exercise and weight reduction alone have not been able to control 
(or lower) your blood sugar.
Repaglinide Krka can also be given with metformin, another medicine for diabetes.
Repaglinide Krka has been shown to lower the blood sugar, which helps to prevent complications
