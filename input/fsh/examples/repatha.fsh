<p>Repatha is a medicine that lowers levels of  bad  cholesterol, a type of fat, in the blood. </p>
<p>Repatha contains the active substance evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised 
protein designed to attach to a target substance in the body). Evolocumab is designed to attach to a 
substance called PCSK9 that affects the liver s ability to take in cholesterol. By attaching to, and 
mopping up PCSK9, the medicine increases the amount of cholesterol entering the liver and so lowers 
the level of cholesterol in the blood. </p>
<p>What Repatha is used for </p>
<p>Repatha is used in addition to your cholesterol lowering diet if you are: 
* an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia 
[heterozygous familial and non-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia). It is given:</p>
<ul>
<li>together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. </li>
<li>alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. </li>
<li>a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because of a 
condition that runs in your family (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HeFH). It is 
given alone or together with other cholesterol lowering treatments </li>
<li>an adult or a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because 
of a condition that runs in your family (homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HoFH). 
It is given together with other cholesterol lowering treatments </li>
<li>
<p>an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood and established atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems). It is given:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. </p>
</li>
<li>alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. </li>
</ul>
<p>Repatha is used in patients who cannot control their cholesterol levels with a cholesterol lowering diet 
alone. You should stay on your cholesterol lowering diet while taking this medicine. Repatha can help 
prevent heart attack, stroke, and certain heart procedures to restore blood flow to the heart due to a 
build-up of fatty deposits in your arteries (also known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). </p>         </div>"""

(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Repatha if you have liver disease. </p>
<p>The needle cover of the glass pre-filled syringe is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), 
which may cause severe allergic reactions. </p>
<p>In order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name 
and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make 
a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>The use of Repatha has been studied in children 10 years of age and older being treated for 
heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. </p>
<p>The use of Repatha has not been studied in children under 10 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Repatha </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Repatha has not been tested in pregnant women. It is not known if Repatha will harm your unborn 
baby. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Repatha is found in breast milk. </p>
<p>It is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help 
you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Repatha, considering the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Repatha to the mother. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Repatha has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Repatha contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose depends on the underlying condition: 
* for adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia the dose is either 
140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
* for children aged 10 years or older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia the dose is 
either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
* for adults or children aged 10 years or older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
the recommended starting dose is 420 mg once monthly. After 12 weeks your doctor may 
decide to increase the dose to 420 mg every two weeks. If you also receive apheresis, a 
procedure similar to dialysis where cholesterol and other fats are removed from the blood, your 
doctor may decide to start you on a dose of 420 mg every two weeks to coincide with your 
apheresis treatment. 
* for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, 
stroke or blood vessel problems) the dose is either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once 
monthly. </p>
<p>Repatha is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). </p>
<p>If your doctor prescribes a dose of 420 mg you must use three pre-filled syringes because each 
pre-filled syringe only contains 140 mg of medicine. After reaching room temperature, all injections 
should be given within a 30 minute period. </p>
<p>If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver can give the injections of Repatha, you or your caregiver 
should receive training on how to prepare and inject Repatha correctly. Do not try to inject Repatha 
until you have been shown how to do it by your doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>See the detailed  Instructions for Use  at the end of this leaflet for instructions about how to store, 
prepare, and give your Repatha injections at home. </p>
<p>Before starting Repatha, you should be on a diet to lower your cholesterol. You should keep on this 
cholesterol lowering diet while taking Repatha. </p>
<p>If your doctor has prescribed Repatha along with another cholesterol lowering medicine, follow your 
doctor s instructions on how to take these medicines together. In this case, please read the dosage 
instructions in the package leaflet of that particular medicine as well. </p>
<p>If you use more Repatha than you should </p>
<p>Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Repatha </p>
<p>Take Repatha as soon as you can after the missed dose. Then, contact your doctor who will tell you 
when you should schedule your next dose, and follow the new schedule exactly as your doctor has told 
you. </p>         </div>"""
