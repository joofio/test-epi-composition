enzyme  -galactosidase. It is produced by switching on the gene for  -galactosidase A in cells. The 
enzyme is then removed from the cells and made into a sterile concentrate for solution for infusion.
Replagal is used to treat adult patients, as well as adolescents and children from the age of 7, with 
confirmed diagnosis of Fabry Disease. It is used as long-term enzyme replacement therapy when the 
level of enzyme in the body is absent or lower than normal as in Fabry Disease.
After 6 months of therapy Replagal significantly reduced pain in patients when compared to placebo 
(dummy) treated patients. Replagal reduced left ventricle mass in treated patients compared to placebo
treated patients. These results suggest the symptoms of the disease are improving or the disease is 
becoming stable.</p>         </div>"""

section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before Replagal is used.
If you notice any of these effects during or after an infusion you should tell your doctor immediately:
-
high fever, chills, sweating, fast heart rate.
-
vomiting.
-
light-headedness.
-
hives.
-
swelling in your hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth or throat which may cause difficulty in 
swallowing or breathing.
Your doctor may stop the infusion temporarily (5   10 min) until the symptoms go away and then 
begin the infusion again.
Your doctor may also treat the symptoms with other medicines (antihistamines or corticosteroids).
Most of the time you can still be given Replagal even if these symptoms occur.
If you experience a severe allergic (anaphylactic-type) reaction, the administration of Replagal will be 
immediately discontinued and an appropriate treatment will have to be initiated by your doctor.
If treatment with Replagal makes your body produce antibodies this will not stop Replagal from 
working and the antibodies may disappear with time.
If you have advanced renal disease, you may find that your Replagal treatment has a limited effect on 
your kidneys. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Replagal.
Children
The experience in children 0-6 years old is limited and therefore no dose can be recommended for this 
age group.
Other medicines and Replagal
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Tell your doctor if you use any medicines containing chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or
gentamicin. There is a theoretical risk of decreased agalsidase alfa activity.
Pregnancy and breast feeding
Very limited clinical data on pregnancies exposed to Replagal have shown no adverse effects on the 
mother and newborn child. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
You may drive and use machines whilst on Replagal.
Replagal contains sodium
This medicine contains 14.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
Keeping a record
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded by your healthcare professional. Speak with your 
healthcare professional if you are not sure.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>This medicine should be applied and supervised by appropriately trained personnel, who will also 
calculate the dose that you will be given. While remaining under the physician s supervision, Replagal 
can be self-administered (by you or your caregiver) after appropriate training by the treating physician
and/or nurse. Self-administration should occur in the presence of a responsible adult.
The recommended dose is an infusion of 0.2 mg for every kg you weigh. This would be about 14 mg 
or 4 vials (glass bottles) of Replagal for an average size (70 kg) individual.
Use in children and adolescents
For children and adolescents 7-18 years old a dose of 0.2 mg/kg every other week may be used.
Children and adolescents may be more likely than adults to experience an infusion related reaction.
Tell your doctor if you experience any side effects whilst having the infusion.
Method of administration
Replagal has to be diluted in 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution before use. After dilution 
Replagal is given in a vein. This will usually be in your arm.
The infusion will be given every two weeks.
Each time you are treated it will take 40 minutes for Replagal to be given to you in a vein. Your 
treatment will be supervised by a doctor who specialises in the treatment of Fabry Disease.
For self-administration, the dose and rate of infusion given should not be changed without the 
agreement of the treating physician.
If you use more Replagal than you should
If you believe you have used more Replagal than you should, please contact your doctor.
If you use less Replagal than you should
If you believe you have used less Replagal than you should, please contact your doctor.
If you forget to use Replagal
If you have missed an infusion of Replagal, please contact your doctor.
If you stop using Replagal
Do not stop using Replagal without contacting your doctor. If you have any further questions on the 
use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
