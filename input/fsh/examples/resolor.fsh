The doctor may want to reassess your condition and the benefit of continued treatment after the first 
4 weeks and thereafter at regular intervals.
The usual dose of Resolor for most patients is one 2 mg tablet once a day.
If you are older than 65 years or have severe liver disease, the starting dose is one 1 mg tablet once a 
day, which your doctor may increase to 2 mg once a day if needed.
Your doctor may also recommend a lower dose of one 1 mg tablet daily if you have severe kidney
disease.
Taking a higher dose than recommended will not make the product work better.
Resolor is only for adults and should not be taken by children and adolescents up to 18 years.
If you take more Resolor than you should
It is important to keep to the dose as prescribed by your doctor. If you have taken more Resolor than 
you should, it is possible that you will get diarrhoea, headache and/or nausea. In case of diarrhoea, 
make sure that you drink enough water.
If you forget to take Resolor
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. Just take your next dose at the usual time.
If you stop taking Resolor
If you stop taking Resolor, your constipation symptoms may come back again.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
