<li>if your child is allergic to teduglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) or trace residues of tetracycline. </li>
<li>if your child has or is suspected to have cancer. </li>
<li>if your child has had cancer in the gastrointestinal tract, including liver, gallbladder or bile 
ducts, and pancreas within the last five years. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your child s doctor before using Revestive:</p>
<ul>
<li>if your child has severely decreased liver function. The doctor will consider this when 
prescribing this medicine. </li>
<li>if your child suffers from certain cardiovascular diseases (affecting the heart and/or blood 
vessels) such as high blood pressure (hypertension) or has a weak heart (cardiac insufficiency). 
The signs and symptoms include sudden weight gain, face swelling, swollen ankles and/or 
shortness of breath. </li>
<li>if your child has other severe diseases that are not well controlled. The doctor will consider this 
when prescribing this medicine. </li>
<li>if your child has decreased kidney function. The doctor may need to give your child a lower 
dose of this medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>When starting and while getting treated with Revestive, the doctor may adjust the amount of 
intravenous fluids or nutrition your child receives. </p>
<p>Medical check-ups before and during treatment with Revestive 
Before starting treatment with this medicine, your child will have a test done to see if there is blood in 
the stool. Your child will also have a colonoscopy done (a procedure to see inside their colon and 
rectum to check for the presence of polyps (small abnormal growths) and have them removed) if they 
have unexplained blood in their bowel movements (stools). If polyps are found before treatment with 
Revestive, the doctor will decide whether your child should use this medicine. Revestive should not be 
used if a cancer is detected during colonoscopy. The doctor will perform further colonoscopies if your 
child continues treatment with Revestive. The doctor will monitor your child s body fluids and 
electrolytes as an imbalance may cause fluid overload or dehydration. </p>
<p>The doctor will take special care and monitor your child s small bowel function and monitor for signs 
and symptoms indicating problems with the gallbladder, bile ducts and pancreas. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Children below 4 months of age 
This medicine should not be used in children under 4 months of age. This is because there is limited 
experience with Revestive in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Revestive </p>
<p>Tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Revestive may affect how other medicines are absorbed from the gut and therefore how well they 
work. The doctor may have to change your child s dose of other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, the use of Revestive is not recommended. </p>
<p>If your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask the 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving, cycling and using machines </p>
<p>This medicine may cause your child to feel dizzy. If this happens to your child, they should not drive, 
ride a bicycle or use machines until they feel better. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients in Revestive </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that it is essentially 
 sodium-free . 
Caution is needed if your child is hypersensitive to tetracycline (see  Do not use Revestive  section). </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dose 
The recommended daily dose for your child is 0.05 mg per kg body weight. The dose will be given 
in millilitres (ml) of solution. </p>
<p>The doctor will choose the dose that is right for your child, depending on their body weight. The 
doctor will tell you which dose to inject. If you are not sure, ask the doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>How to use Revestive 
Revestive is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) once daily. The injection can be 
self-administered or given by another person, for example your child s doctor, his/her assistant or your 
child s home nurse. If you, or the carer, are injecting the medicine, you or the carer must receive 
adequate training by the doctor or nurse. You will find detailed instructions for injections at the end of 
this leaflet. </p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that every time your child receives a dose of Revestive, the name and lot 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the lots used. </p>
<p>If you use more Revestive than you should </p>
<p>If you inject more Revestive than you are told to by your child s doctor, you should contact the doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Revestive </p>
<p>If you forget to inject this medicine (or cannot inject it at the usual time), use it as soon as possible on 
that day. Never use more than one injection in the same day. Do not inject a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Revestive </p>
<p>Keep using this medicine for as long as your child s doctor prescribes it for them. Do not stop using 
this medicine without consulting the doctor, as a sudden stop can cause changes in your child s fluid 
balance. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child s doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse. </p>         </div>"""
