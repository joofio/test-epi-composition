<li>sildenafil if you suffer from a lung disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension that 
makes breathing difficult. Patients without this disease may use sildenafil for impotence 
(erectile dysfunction) under their doctor s supervision (see the section on Other 
medicines and Ritonavir Mylan); </li>
<li>avanafil or vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction); </li>
<li>colchicine (used to treat gout) if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see the section 
on Other medicines and Ritonavir Mylan); </li>
<li>products containing St John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as this may stop ritonavir 
from working properly. St John s wort is often used in herbal medicines that you can buy 
yourself. </li>
<li>Your doctor may decide that you can take rifabutin and/or voriconazole with a booster (lower 
dose) of ritonavir but a full dose of ritonavir must not be taken together with these two 
medicines. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about switching to a different 
medicine while you are taking Ritonavir Mylan. </p>
<p>Also read the list of medicines under  Other medicines and Ritonavir Mylan  for use with certain other 
medicines which require special care. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Ritonavir Mylan. </p>
<p>Important information 
- If Ritonavir Mylan is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important 
that you also carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines. There may 
be additional information in those leaflets about situations when ritonavir should be avoided. If 
you have any further questions about Ritonavir Mylan (ritonavir) or the other medicines 
prescribed, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
- Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. 
- People taking ritonavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection or AIDS. It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor 
while taking Ritonavir Mylan. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have/had:</p>
<ul>
<li>A history of liver disease. </li>
<li>Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at 
a greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the 
liver. Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly. </li>
<li>Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia 
who are taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors). The reason for this is not known. 
You may need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any 
bleeding. </li>
<li>Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension 
and prolonged erection. </li>
<li>Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes 
mellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors. </li>
<li>Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines 
(such as protease inhibitors). </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the 
medicines you are taking work. </li>
<li>Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of 
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Some patients taking ritonavir can develop serious 
problems with their pancreas. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you. </li>
<li>Symptoms of infection - inform your doctor immediately. Some patients with advanced HIV 
infection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections 
they have had in the past even if they didn t know they had had them. It is believed that this 
happens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these 
infections. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment. </li>
<li>Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty 
moving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone 
(osteonecrosis). Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this 
disease. </li>
<li>Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy 
including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions these muscle 
disorders have been serious. (See section 4 Possible side effects) </li>
<li>Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat. Some patients taking 
ritonavir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Tell your doctor if you have 
a heart defect or conduction defect. </li>
<li>If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Ritonavir Mylan is not recommended in children below 2 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ritonavir Mylan </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. There are some medicines you cannot 
take at all with ritonavir. These are listed earlier in section 2, under  Do not take Ritonavir Mylan . 
There are some other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below. </p>
<p>The following warnings apply when Ritonavir Mylan is taken as a full dose. However, these warnings 
may also apply when Ritonavir Mylan is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be 
taken. </p>
<ul>
<li>Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction). 
The dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid 
hypotension and prolonged erection. You must not take Ritonavir Mylan with sildenafil if you 
suffer from pulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know 
before you or your child takes Ritonavir Mylan). Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil 
for pulmonary arterial hypertension. </li>
<li>Colchicine (for gout) as ritonavir may raise the blood levels of this medicine. You must not take 
ritonavir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also  Do not take 
Ritonavir Mylan  above). </li>
<li>Digoxin (heart medicine). Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you 
while you are taking digoxin and Ritonavir Mylan in order to avoid heart problems. </li>
<li>Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol as ritonavir may reduce the effectiveness 
of these medicines. It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of 
contraception is used instead. You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking 
this type of hormonal contraceptive with ritonavir. </li>
<li>Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as ritonavir may raise the blood levels of 
these medicines. Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with 
ritonavir (see also  Do not take Ritonavir Mylan  above). </li>
<li>Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as ritonavir 
may raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing s syndrome 
(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol. Your doctor 
may wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely. </li>
<li>Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood 
pressure and fainting can occur when taken with ritonavir. </li>
<li>Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver 
damage can occur when taken with ritonavir. </li>
<li>Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as ritonavir may increase the 
blood levels of this medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are medicines that may not mix with ritonavir because their effects could increase or decrease 
when taken together. In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or 
monitor you regularly. This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, 
including those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention 
these:</p>
<ul>
<li>amphetamine or amphetamine derivatives; </li>
<li>antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin); </li>
<li>anticancer treatments (e.g. abemaciclib, afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, dasatinib, 
ibrutinib, nilotinib, venetoclax, vincristine, vinblastine); </li>
<li>medicines used to treat low blood platelet count (e.g. fostamatinib) </li>
<li>anticoagulants (e.g. dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, vorapaxar, warfarin); </li>
<li>antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine, imipramine, nefazodone, 
nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone); </li>
<li>antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); </li>
<li>antihistamines (e.g. loratadine, fexofenadine); </li>
<li>antiretroviral medicines including HIV-protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, 
fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTI) (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and others (didanosine, maraviroc, 
raltegravir, zidovudine); </li>
<li>anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline and delamanid); </li>
<li>antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and simeprevir); </li>
<li>anxiety medicine, buspirone; </li>
<li>asthma medicine, theophylline, salmeterol; </li>
<li>atovaquone, a medicine used to treat a certain type of pneumonia and malaria; </li>
<li>buprenorphine, a medicine used for the treatment of chronic pain; </li>
<li>bupropion, a medicine used to help you stop smoking; </li>
<li>epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine, phenytoin); </li>
<li>heart medicines (e.g. disopyramide, mexiletine and calcium channel antagonists such as 
amlodipine, diltiazem and nifedipine); </li>
<li>immune system (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus); </li>
<li>levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid problems) </li>
<li>morphine and morphine-like medicines used to treat severe pain (e.g. methadone, fentanyl); </li>
<li>sleeping pills (e.g. alprazolam, zolpidem) and also midazolam administered by injection; </li>
<li>tranquillisers (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine); </li>
<li>colchicine, a treatment for gout. 
There are some medicines you cannot take at all with ritonavir. These are listed earlier in section 2, 
under  Do not take Ritonavir Mylan . </li>
</ul>
<p>Taking Ritonavir Mylan with food and drink </p>
<p>Ritonavir Mylan tablets should be taken with food. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, it is very 
important that you ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>There is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active substance in Ritonavir 
Mylan) during pregnancy. In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months 
of pregnancy at a lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors. Ritonavir did not appear to 
increase the chance of developing birth defects compared to the general population. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Ritonavir Mylan can cause dizziness. If you are affected do not drive or use machinery. </p>
<p>Ritonavir Mylan contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 87.75 mg of sodium in each tablet. This is equivalent to 4.4% of the 
recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
if you need five or more tablets daily for a prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to 
follow a low salt (sodium) diet. </p>         </div>"""

<p>It is important that Ritonavir Mylan tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. </p>
<p>Recommended doses of Ritonavir Mylan are: 
* if Ritonavir Mylan is used to boost the effects of certain other anti-HIV medicines the typical 
dose for adults is 1 to 2 tablets once or twice daily. For more detailed dose recommendations, 
including those for children, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Ritonavir Mylan 
is given in combination with. 
* if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 tablets in the morning 
and 3 tablets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose 
of 6 tablets twice daily (totalling 1,200 mg per day). Children (2 - 12 years of age) will start 
with a dose smaller than this and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size. </p>
<p>Your doctor will advise you on the dose to be taken. </p>
<p>Other forms of this medicine may be more appropriate for children who have difficulty swallowing 
tablets. 
Ritonavir Mylan should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you 
feel. If a side effect is preventing you from taking Ritonavir Mylan as directed, tell your doctor 
straight away. During episodes of diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed. </p>
<p>Always keep enough Ritonavir Mylan on hand so you don't run out. When you travel or need to stay in 
the hospital, make sure you have enough Ritonavir Mylan to last until you can get a new supply. </p>
<p>If you take more Ritonavir Mylan than you should </p>
<p>Numbness, tingling, or a  pins and needles  sensation may occur if you take too much ritonavir. If you 
realise you have taken more Ritonavir Mylan than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the 
Accident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Ritonavir Mylan </p>
<p>If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible. If it is nearly time for the next dose, just 
take that one. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Ritonavir Mylan </p>
<p>Even if you feel better, do not stop taking Ritonavir Mylan without talking to your doctor. Taking 
Ritonavir Mylan as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the 
medicines. </p>         </div>"""
