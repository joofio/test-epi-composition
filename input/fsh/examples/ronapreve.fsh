<p>Ronapreve is made up of the active substances  casirivimab  and  imdevimab . Casirivimab and 
imdevimab are a type of protein called  monoclonal antibodies .  </p>
<p>What Ronapreve is used for </p>
<p>Ronapreve is used to treat adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 40 kg with 
COVID-19 who do not require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and are at increased risk for the illness 
becoming severe based on the evaluation of your doctor. </p>
<p>Ronapreve is used to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 
40 kg who require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and who test negative for antibodies (proteins in the 
body s defence system) against COVID-19. Ronapreve is used to prevent COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at 
least 40 kg. </p>
<p>How Ronapreve works </p>
<p>Ronapreve attaches to a protein on the surface of the coronavirus called the  spike protein . This stops 
the virus from getting into your cells and from spreading between cells.   </p>         </div>"""
