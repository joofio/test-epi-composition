from the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus 
infection. </p>
<p>How Rotarix works </p>
<p>Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. 
Rotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. 
Most children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill 
with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation. </p>
<p>When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body s natural defences) will make 
antibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against 
disease caused by these types of rotavirus. </p>
<p>As with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the 
rotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. </p>         </div>"""

* if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy 
skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
* if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of 
bowel becomes enfolded within another segment). 
* if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. 
* if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe 
Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). 
* if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone 
the vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but 
talk to your doctor first. 
* if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination 
until recovery. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: 
* he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, 
e.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. 
* he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. 
* he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. 
* he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or 
if his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune 
system. </p>
<p>After your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your 
child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or 
high fever (see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>As always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rotarix 
Tell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has 
recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Rotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, 
such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or 
inactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C 
conjugate vaccines. </p>
<p>Rotarix with food and drink 
There are no restrictions on your child s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after 
vaccination. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against 
rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the 
vaccination schedule. </p>
<p>Rotarix contains sorbitol, sucrose, glucose, phenylalanine and sodium 
This vaccine contains 13.5 mg sorbitol in each dose.  </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, 
contact your doctor before your child receives this vaccine. </p>
<p>This vaccine contains 0.15 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
your child has phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up 
because the body cannot remove it properly. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Your child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with 
an interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 
weeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they 
should preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  </p>
<p>Rotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely,

<p>In case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be

stools. The signs of gastroenteritis may include feeling sick, being sick, stomach cramps or 
diarrhoea. </p>
