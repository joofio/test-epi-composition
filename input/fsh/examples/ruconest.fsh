<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before using Ruconest. 
If you experience allergic reactions e.g. hives, rash, itching, dizziness, wheezing, difficulty breathing or your 
tongue swells up following the administration of Ruconest, you should seek emergency medical assistance so 
that symptoms of your allergic reaction can be treated urgently. </p>
<p>Before you start treatment with Ruconest, it is important that you tell your doctor if you have, or have had, 
problems with your blood clotting (thrombotic events). You will be carefully monitored if this is the case. 
Hypersensitivity reactions cannot be excluded and may have symptoms similar to angioedema attacks. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 2 years old. Ruconest has not been studied in children younger 
than 5 years of age. Your doctor will determine whether treatment of your child with Ruconest is 
appropriate. Additional monitoring of your child for symptoms of allergic reactions during and after 
administration is needed. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ruconest 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
If you are receiving tissue type plasminogen activator as acute treatment for blood clots, you should not be 
treated with Ruconest at the same time. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
It is not recommended to use Ruconest during pregnancy or breast-feeding.<br />
If you plan becoming pregnant, discuss with your doctor before starting to use Ruconest. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machinery if you feel dizzy or suffer from headache after using Ruconest.  </p>
<p>Ruconest contains sodium (19.5 mg per vial) 
This should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""
