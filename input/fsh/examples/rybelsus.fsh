levels. </p>
<p>Rybelsus is used to treat adults (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise 
is not enough: 
* on its own   when you cannot use metformin (another diabetes medicine) or 
* with other medicines for diabetes   when the other medicines are not enough to control your 
blood sugar levels. These may be medicines you take by mouth or inject such as insulin. </p>
<p>It is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as agreed with your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>What is type 2 diabetes? 
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that 
your body makes does not lower your blood sugar the way it should. In some cases, your body can 
produce too much blood sugar. If your blood sugar increases and remains high over a long period of 
time, this can lead to harmful effects such as heart problems, kidney disease, eye disorders and poor 
circulation in your limbs. That is why it is important to keep your blood sugar levels within a normal 
range. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rybelsus. </p>
<p>Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, record the name and the lot 
number (included on the outer cartons and blister) of the medicine you are taking and provide this 
information when reporting any side effects. </p>
<p>General: 
This medicine is not the same as insulin and you should not use it if: 
* you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin) 
* you develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, 
breathing difficulty, confusion, excessive thirst, a sweet smell to the breath or a sweet or 
metallic taste in the mouth. </p>
<p>Stomach and gut problems and dehydration 
During treatment with this medicine, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have 
diarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you drink 
enough fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney problems. Talk 
to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. </p>
<p>Severe and on-going stomach pain which could be due to an inflamed pancreas 
If you have severe and on-going pain in the stomach area   see a doctor straight away as this could be 
a sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis). </p>
<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Taking a sulfonylurea medicine or insulin with Rybelsus might increase the risk of getting low blood 
sugar (hypoglycaemia). See section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar levels.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help to decide if the dose of the 
sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low blood sugar. </p>
<p>Diabetic eye disease (retinopathy) 
Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of diabetic eye disease. 
If you have diabetic eye disease and get eye problems while taking this medicine, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Treatment response 
If the treatment response with semaglutide is lower than expected, this may be due to low absorption 
caused by variability in absorption and low absolute bioavailability. You should follow the 
instructions given in section 3 for optimal effect of semaglutide. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended in children and adolescents aged under 18 years as the safety and 
efficacy in this age group have not been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rybelsus 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing any of the 
following: 
* levothyroxine which is used for thyroid disease. This is because your doctor may need to check 
your thyroid levels if you are taking Rybelsus together with levothyroxine. 
* warfarin or similar medicines taken by mouth to reduce blood clotting (oral anti-coagulants). 
You may need frequent blood tests to check how quickly your blood clots. 
* If you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will 
recommend you to monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid hyperglycaemia 
(high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the 
body is unable to breakdown glucose because there is not enough insulin). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine should not be used during pregnancy, as it is not known if it affects your unborn baby. 
Therefore, use of contraception is recommended while taking this medicine. If you wish to become 
pregnant, discuss how to change your treatment with your doctor as you should stop using this 
medicine at least 2 months in advance. If you become pregnant while using this medicine, talk to your 
doctor straight away, as your treatment will need to be changed. </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Rybelsus is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Some patients may feel dizzy when taking Rybelsus. If you feel dizzy, be extra careful while driving 
or using machines. Talk to your doctor for the further information. </p>
<p>If you use this medicine in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Do not drive or use 
machines if you get any signs of low blood sugar. See section 2,  Warning and precautions  for 
information on increased risk of low blood sugar and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood 
sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. </p>
<p>Rybelsus contains sodium 
This medicine contains 23 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each tablet. This is 
equivalent to 1% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much to take 
* The starting dose is one 3 mg tablet once a day for one month. 
* After one month, your doctor will increase your dose to 7 mg once a day. 
* Your doctor may increase your dose to 14 mg once a day if your blood sugar is not controlled 
well enough with a dose of 7 mg once a day. 
Your doctor will prescribe the strength that is right for you. Do not change your dose unless your 
doctor has told you so. It is not recommended to take two 7 mg tablets to get the effect of one 14 mg 
tablet, as this has not been studied. </p>
<p>Taking this medicine 
* Take your Rybelsus tablet on an empty stomach at any time of the day. 
* Swallow your Rybelsus tablet whole with a sip of water (up to 120 ml). Do not split, crush or 
chew the tablet, as it is not known if it affects absorption of semaglutide. 
* After taking your Rybelsus tablet wait at least 30 minutes before having your first meal or drink 
of the day or taking other oral medicines. Waiting less than 30 minutes lowers the absorption of 
semaglutide. </p>
<p>If you take more Rybelsus than you should 
If you take more Rybelsus than you should, talk to your doctor straight away. You may get side effects 
such as feeling sick (nausea).  </p>
<p>If you forget to take Rybelsus 
If you forget to take a dose, skip the missed dose and just take your normal dose the next day. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Rybelsus 
Do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor. If you stop using it, your blood sugar 
levels may increase.  </p>
