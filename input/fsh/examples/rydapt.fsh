  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Rydapt is 
Rydapt contains the active substance midostaurin. It belongs to a class of medicines called protein 
kinase inhibitors. </p>
<p>What Rydapt is used for 
Rydapt is used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adults who have a defect in a gene called 
FLT3. Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of cancer of certain white blood cells (called myeloid cells) 
in which the body over-produces an abnormal type of these cells. </p>
<p>Rydapt is also used in adults to treat aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis 
with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL). These are 
disorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type of white blood cell. Symptoms are 
caused when too many mast cells enter organs such as the liver, bone marrow or spleen, and release 
substances such as histamine into the blood. </p>
<p>How Rydapt works 
Midostaurin blocks the action of some enzymes (kinases) in the abnormal cells and stops their division 
and growth. </p>
<p>At the start of treatment in AML Rydapt is always used together with chemotherapy (medicines for 
treating cancer). </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Rydapt works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Do not take Rydapt 
- if you are allergic to midostaurin or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
- if you are already taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines used to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampicin; </li>
<li>medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as carbamazepine or phenytoin; </li>
<li>enzalutamide, a medicine used to treat prostate cancer; </li>
<li>St. John s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to treat 
depression. 
These medicines must be avoided during treatment with Rydapt. Talk to your doctor if you are 
told that you have to start taking one of them during Rydapt treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rydapt:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have any infections. </li>
<li>if you have a heart disorder. </li>
<li>if you have problems with your lungs or problems breathing. </li>
<li>if you have problems with your kidneys. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away if you get any of these symptoms during treatment 
with Rydapt:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have fever, sore throat or mouth ulcers, because these may indicate that your white blood 
cell count is low. </li>
<li>if you have new or worsening symptoms such as fever, cough with or without mucous, chest 
pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, because these may be signs of lung problems. </li>
<li>if you have or experience chest pain or discomfort, light-headedness, fainting, dizziness, blue 
discolouration of your lips, hands or feet, shortness of breath, or swelling of your lower limbs 
(oedema) or skin, because these may be signs of heart problems. 
Your doctor may need to adjust, temporarily stop or completely discontinue your treatment with 
Rydapt. </li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring during treatment with Rydapt 
Your doctor will perform regular blood tests during treatment with Rydapt in order to monitor the 
amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) and electrolytes (e.g. calcium, 
potassium, magnesium) in your body. Your heart and lung function will also be checked regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Rydapt should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age who are also receiving 
other chemotherapy, because it could cause a severe reduction of certain types of blood cells. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rydapt 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Rydapt can affect the way some medicines work. Some other medicines 
can also affect how Rydapt works. </p>
<p>The following medicines must be avoided during treatment with Rydapt:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines used to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampicin; </li>
<li>medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as carbamazepine or phenytoin; </li>
<li>enzalutamide, a medicine used to treat prostate cancer; </li>
<li>St. John s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to treat 
depression. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>some medicines used to treat infections, such as ketoconazole or clarithromycin; </li>
<li>some medicines used to treat HIV, such as ritonavir or efavirenz; </li>
<li>some medicines used to treat depression, such as nefazodone or bupropion; </li>
<li>some medicines used to control levels of fat in your blood, such as atorvastatin or rosuvastatin; </li>
<li>tizanidine, a medicine used to relax muscles; </li>
<li>chlorzoxazone, a medicine used for treating discomfort caused by muscle spasms. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor might prescribe a different medicine for you 
during your treatment with Rydapt. </p>
<p>You should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Rydapt and you are prescribed a new 
medicine that you have not previously taken during treatment with Rydapt. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether your medicine is one of the medicines listed 
above. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Rydapt may harm your unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Rydapt could harm your baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment with Rydapt and for at 
least 4 months after stopping the treatment. </p>
<p>Contraception in women 
If you become pregnant while taking Rydapt, it may harm your baby. Your doctor will ask you to take 
a pregnancy test before you start treatment with Rydapt to make sure you are not pregnant. You must 
use an effective method of contraception while taking Rydapt and for at least 4 months after you have 
stopped taking it. Your doctor will discuss with you the most suitable method of contraception for you 
to use. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant, tell your doctor right away. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Rydapt may reduce fertility in men and women. You should discuss this with your doctor before 
starting treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Take special care when driving and using machines as you may develop dizziness and vertigo while 
you are taking Rydapt. </p>
<p>Rydapt contains ethanol anhydrous (alcohol) 
This medicine contains 666 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 200 mg dose (maximum daily dose) which 
is equivalent to 14 vol. % ethanol anhydrous. The amount in a 200 mg dose of this medicine is 
equivalent to 17 ml beer or 7 ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any 
noticeable effects. Alcohol may be harmful if you have alcohol-related problems, epilepsy or liver 
problems, or if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Rydapt contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate (castor oil) 
This medicine contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate, which may cause stomach discomfort and 
diarrhoea. </p>         </div>"""

- Take Rydapt twice a day at about 12-hour intervals (for example, with breakfast and with your 
evening meal). 
- Take Rydapt with food. 
- Swallow the capsules whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew them to ensure 
proper dosing and avoid the unpleasant taste of the capsule content.

follow your doctor s recommendations. 
- If you vomit after you swallow the capsules, do not take any more capsules until your next 
scheduled dose. </p>

go to a hospital straight away, taking the pack with you, as medical treatment may be necessary. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Rydapt 
If you forget to take Rydapt, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, wait until it is time for your next dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Rydapt 
Stopping your treatment with Rydapt may cause your condition to become worse. Do not stop taking 
your medicine unless your doctor tells you to do so. </p>
