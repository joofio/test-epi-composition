  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or nurse if you 
are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is one single transdermal patch. The medicine in the transdermal patch passes 
gradually through your skin into your body and, therefore, the patch is applied 1 to 2 days (24 to 
48 hours) before the start of chemotherapy treatment. </p>
<p>This medicine is for transdermal use. This medicine delivers the active substance slowly and 
constantly through your skin and into your blood stream for the duration that you are wearing the 
transdermal patch. </p>
<p>Things to remember when using the transdermal patch 
- Do not keep or store the transdermal patch outside the sealed sachet. 
- Do not cut the transdermal patch into smaller pieces. 
- Use only one transdermal patch at a time. 
- When you remove the transdermal patch, check your skin and tell your doctor if you notice a 
serious skin reaction (if your skin is very red, itchy or you notice any blisters). 
- The transdermal patch may be affected by direct sunlight or exposure to sunlamps. While you 
are wearing the transdermal patch you must keep it covered, e.g. under clothing, if there is a risk 
of exposure to sunlight or sunlamps. Continue to keep the application site covered for a further 
10 days after removing the transdermal patch. 
- Contact with water during bathing or showering will not change the way SANCUSO works. 
- However, the transdermal patch may become partially unstuck. Try to avoid wearing the 
transdermal patch in water for long periods of time. 
- There is no information on the effect on the transdermal patch of activities such as strenuous 
exercise or the use of sauna or whirlpools; therefore, you should avoid these activities while 
wearing this transdermal patch. 
- You should avoid external heat (for example hot water bottles or heat pads) on the area of the 
transdermal patch. </p>
<p>When to apply and remove the transdermal patch 
Do not remove the transdermal patch from the sachet until you are ready to use it. Apply a transdermal 
patch at least 1 day (24 hours) before you are scheduled to have chemotherapy treatment. The 
transdermal patch may be applied up to a maximum of 2 days (48 hours) before chemotherapy. Wear 
the transdermal patch all the time during your chemotherapy. The transdermal patch can be worn for 
up to 7 days depending on the duration of your chemotherapy treatment. Remove the transdermal 
patch at least 1 day (24 hours) after completing your chemotherapy. </p>
<p>Where to apply the transdermal patch 
Put the transdermal patch on a clean, dry, healthy area of skin on the outside part of your upper arm. If 
your arms are not suitable areas to apply the transdermal patch your doctor may ask you to put it on 
your abdomen. The area you choose should not be oily, recently shaved or have any skin problems 
such as being injured (cut or scraped) or irritated (redness or a rash). Do not put SANCUSO on areas 
that have been treated with creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products that could keep the 
transdermal patch from sticking well to your skin. </p>
<p>How to apply the transdermal patch 
1. Remove a sachet from the box and tear it open using the slit provided. Each sachet contains one 
transdermal patch stuck onto a rigid plastic film. 
2. Take the transdermal patch out of the sachet. </p>
<ol>
<li>The sticky side of the transdermal patch is covered by a two-piece rigid plastic film. Bend the 
transdermal patch in the middle and remove one half of the rigid plastic film. Be careful not to 
stick the transdermal patch to itself and avoid touching the sticky side of the transdermal patch. </li>
<li>While holding the remaining half of the rigid plastic film, apply the transdermal patch to the skin 
on the outside part of your upper arm. </li>
<li>Remove the second half of the rigid plastic film and press the whole transdermal patch firmly in 
place with your fingers and smooth down. Press firmly making sure there is good contact with 
the skin, especially around the edges. </li>
<li>Wash your hands after applying the transdermal patch. </li>
<li>Keep the transdermal patch in place for the whole time you are having chemotherapy. </li>
<li>Do not re-use the transdermal patch after removal, see below for instructions on transdermal 
patch removal and disposal (see section 5). </li>
</ol>
<p>After removing the transdermal patch 
1. The used transdermal patch will still contain some granisetron and should be disposed of 
immediately as described in section 5. 2. After removing the transdermal patch you may find some sticky material is left on your skin. 
Gently wash the area with soap and water to remove it. Alcohol or other dissolving liquids such 
as nail polish remover may cause skin irritation and should not be used. 
3. Wash your hands. 
4. You may see mild redness on the skin where the transdermal patch is removed. This redness 
should go away over time. If it does not, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If the transdermal patch becomes unstuck 
If the transdermal patch starts to become unstuck, the same transdermal patch may be secured to the 
same area of skin. If required, use surgical bandages or medical adhesive tape to keep the transdermal 
patch in place. If the transdermal patch is lost or becomes damaged go back to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you use more SANCUSO than you should 
If you use more SANCUSO than you should, simply remove the extra patch(es) and contact your 
doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to use SANCUSO 
It is important to use this medicinal product as instructed by your doctor to prevent you feeling sick or 
being sick following your chemotherapy. If you have forgotten to apply your transdermal patch at the 
right time, apply it as soon as you remember, and tell your doctor as soon as possible before your 
chemotherapy treatment. </p>
<p>If you stop using SANCUSO 
It is important to use this medicine during the whole length of your chemotherapy (up to 7 days) to 
prevent you feeling sick or being sick following your chemotherapy. Talk to your doctor if you want 
to remove the patch before the end of your chemotherapy treatment course (up to 7 days). </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
