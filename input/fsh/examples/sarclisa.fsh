Sarclisa is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance isatuximab. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called  monoclonal antibodies .<br />
Monoclonal antibodies, such as Sarclisa, are proteins that have been designed to recognise and attach 
themselves to a target substance. In the case of Sarclisa, the target is a substance called CD38 that is 
found on cells of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. By attaching to multiple myeloma 
cells, the medicine helps the natural defences of your body (immune system) identify and destroy 
them. </p>
<p>What is Sarclisa used for 
Sarclisa is used to treat multiple myeloma in patients who have received treatments for multiple 
myeloma before. 
It is used together with two other combinations of medicines: </p>
<p>pomalidomide and dexamethasone or  </p>
<p>carfilzomib and dexamethasone. </p>
<p>If you have any questions on how Sarclisa works or about your treatment with Sarclisa, ask your 
doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>you are allergic to isatuximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Sarclisa and follow all instructions carefully. </p>
<p>Infusion reactions 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infusion reactions during or after the 
infusion of Sarclisa - see in section 4 for the list of signs of  Infusion reactions . </p>
<p>Before starting a Sarclisa infusion, you may be given medicines to reduce infusion reactions (see 
section 3). </p>
<p>Infusion reactions can happen during the Sarclisa infusion or after the infusion and may be 
serious. These reactions are reversible. The hospital staff will monitor you closely during 
treatment. 
If you get an infusion reaction, your doctor or nurse may give you additional medicines to treat your 
symptoms and prevent complications. They may also temporarily stop, slow down, or completely stop 
the Sarclisa infusion. </p>
<p>Fever and low number of white blood cells 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you develop fever, as it may be a sign of infection. Sarclisa 
can lower the number of white blood cells - which are important for fighting infections. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will check your blood cell counts during treatment with Sarclisa. Your doctor 
may prescribe an antibiotic or antiviral medicine (for example, for herpes zoster [shingles]) to help 
prevent infection, or a medicine to help increase your white blood cell counts during treatment with 
Sarclisa.  </p>
<p>Heart problems<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Sarclisa in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone 
if you have heart problems, or if you have ever taken a medicine for your heart. Contact your doctor or 
nurse immediately if you experience any difficulty breathing, cough, or leg swelling.   </p>
<p>Risk of new cancers<br />
New cancers have occurred in patients during treatment with Sarclisa when given with pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone or with carfilzomib and dexamethasone. Your doctor or nurse will monitor you for 
new cancers during treatment.  </p>
<p>Tumour lysis syndrome 
A fast breakdown of cancer cells (tumour lysis syndrome) may occur. Symptoms may include 
irregular heartbeat, seizures (fits), confusion, muscle cramps, or decrease in urine output. Contact your 
doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. </p>
<p>Blood transfusion 
If you need a blood transfusion, you will have a blood test first to match your blood type. </p>
<p>Tell the person doing the blood test that you are being treated with Sarclisa. This is because it can 
affect the results of this blood test. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Sarclisa is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged under 18 years. This is because 
this medicine has not been tested in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sarclisa 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines you can get without a prescription, and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse before having Sarclisa if you have ever taken a medicine for your heart. </p>
<p>Sarclisa is used together with two other combinations of medicines when treating multiple myeloma: </p>
<p>pomalidomide and dexamethasone or </p>
<p>carfilzomib and dexamethasone. 
For information on the other medicines used with Sarclisa, see their package leaflets. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Sarclisa.<br />
Use of Sarclisa is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or planning to become 
pregnant, talk to your doctor about using Sarclisa. </p>
<p>For information on pregnancy and other medicines that are taken with Sarclisa, please look at the 
package leaflet for these other medicines. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Sarclisa. </p>
<p>This is because Sarclisa may pass into breast milk.  It is not known how it could affect the baby. </p>
<p>You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your 
baby. 
Contraception 
Women who are using Sarclisa and are able to become pregnant must use an effective method of 
contraception. Talk to your doctor about the method of contraception that you must use during this 
time. Use contraception during treatment - and for 5 months after the last dose of Sarclisa. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Sarclisa is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, Sarclisa is used with 
other medicines that may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Please look at the package 
leaflet from the other medicines you take with Sarclisa.  </p>         </div>"""
