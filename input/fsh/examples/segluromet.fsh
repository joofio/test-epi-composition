Segluromet contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and metformin. Each belongs to a group of
medicines called  oral anti-diabetics . These are medicines taken by mouth to treat diabetes.
- Ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
- Metformin belongs to a group of medicines called biguanides.
What Segluromet is used for
- Segluromet lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2
diabetes.
- It can also help prevent heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.
- Segluromet can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and metformin as separate tablets. 
- Segluromet can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. 
- You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Segluromet.
How Segluromet works
- Ertugliflozin works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar to
be removed in your urine.
- Metformin works by decreasing sugar (glucose) production in the liver.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that
your body produces does not work as well as it should. This leads to a high level of sugar in your
blood. When this happens, this can lead to serious medical problems, like heart disease, kidney
disease, blindness and poor circulation.</p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to ertugliflozin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine
(listed in section 6).
- if you have severely reduced kidney function or need dialysis.
- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see  Risk of lactic
acidosis  below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called  ketone
bodies  accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness, or your breath developing an unusual fruity
smell.
- if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated.
- if you have recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems, such as  shock  or
breathing difficulties.
- if you have liver problems.
- if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either regularly or from time to time (please see section
 Segluromet with alcohol ).
Do not take Segluromet if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before
taking Segluromet. 
Warnings and precautions
Risk of lactic acidosis
Segluromet may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if
your kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Segluromet for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Segluromet and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you
experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma.
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>stomach ache (abdominal pain)</li>
<li>muscle cramps</li>
<li>a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness</li>
<li>difficulty in breathing</li>
<li>reduced body temperature and heartbeat</li>
<li>
<p>Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before and while taking Segluromet, if you:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have kidney problems. Your doctor may do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are
working.</p>
</li>
<li>have or have had urinary tract infections.</li>
<li>have or have had yeast infections of the vagina or penis.</li>
<li>have type 1 diabetes. Segluromet should not be used to treat this condition as it may increase the
risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients.</li>
<li>take other diabetes medicines; you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain
medicines.</li>
<li>might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine
production [diuretics] lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). Ask about ways to
prevent dehydration.</li>
<li>
<p>experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and
deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet
or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a doctor or
the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic ketoacidosis <br />
a problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your
urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with
prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin
dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.
It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by
your healthcare professional. 
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness,
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
When this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from
the pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your
insulin or other medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Segluromet during and for some time after the
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with
Segluromet.
During treatment with Segluromet, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Urine glucose 
Because of how Segluromet works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on
this medicine.
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not take this medicine. It is not known if this
medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Segluromet
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to
adjust the dose of Segluromet. In particular, tell your doctor:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics).</p>
</li>
<li>if you are taking other medicines that lower the sugar in your blood, such as insulin or
medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas.</li>
<li>if you are taking medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors,
such as ibuprofen and celecoxib).</li>
<li>if you are taking certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and
angiotensin II receptor antagonists).</li>
<li>if you are taking corticosteroids (used to treat a variety of conditions, such as severe
inflammation of the skin or in asthma).</li>
<li>if you are taking beta-2 agonists such as salbutamol or terbutaline (used to treat asthma).</li>
<li>if you are taking medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially
if you have reduced kidney function (verapamil, rifampicin, cimetidine, dolutegravir,
ranolazine, trimethoprim, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib or olaparib).
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor.
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for
example, in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Segluromet before or at the time of
the injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with
Segluromet.
Segluromet with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Segluromet since this may increase the risk of lactic
acidosis (see section  Warnings and precautions ).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
It is not known if Segluromet can harm your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor
about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. You should not use Segluromet
if you are pregnant.
It is not known if Segluromet passes into breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed
your baby if you take this medicine. You should not use Segluromet if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, taking
this medicine in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas
can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as
shaking, sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not
drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Segluromet.
Segluromet contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .</li>
