</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Semglee in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Semglee. 
Follow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical 
activity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site:<br />
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Semglee). Contact your doctor 
if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medicines dose. </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the 
end of this leaflet). </p>
<p>Travel </p>
<p>Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
- supplies of insulin, needles etc., 
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. </p>
<p>Illnesses and injuries </p>
<p>In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, 
adjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests):</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). </li>
<li>If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). </li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. </p>
<p>If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. </p>
<p>Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. </p>
<p>Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and 
insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you 
experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling (oedema). </p>
<p>Children  </p>
<p>There is no experience with the use of Semglee in children below the age of 2 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Semglee </p>
<p>Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. </p>
<p>Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>all other medicines to treat diabetes, </li>
<li>angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), </li>
<li>disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), </li>
<li>fluoxetine (used to treat depression), </li>
<li>fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), </li>
<li>monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), </li>
<li>pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and 
lower fever), </li>
<li>sulfonamide antibiotics. </li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), </li>
<li>danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), </li>
<li>diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), </li>
<li>diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), </li>
<li>glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), </li>
<li>isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), </li>
<li>oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), </li>
<li>phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), </li>
<li>somatropin (growth hormone), </li>
<li>sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), </li>
<li>thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), </li>
<li>atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), </li>
<li>protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:</p>
<ul>
<li>beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), </li>
<li>clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), </li>
<li>lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. </p>
<p>Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Semglee with alcohol </p>
<p>Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), </li>
<li>you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), </li>
<li>you have problems with your sight. </li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, </li>
<li>the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. </li>
</ul>

you are not sure. </p>
<p>Although Semglee contains the same active substance as insulin glargine 300 units/ml, these 
medicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical 
prescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, consult your doctor for 
further information. </p>
<p>Dose </p>
<p>Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will 
- determine how much Semglee per day you will need and at what time, 
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Semglee. </p>
<p>Semglee is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting 
insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. </p>
<p>Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high 
or too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents </p>
<p>Semglee can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly as 
your doctor has told you. </p>
<p>Frequency of administration </p>
<p>You need one injection of Semglee every day, at the same time of the day. 
Semglee pen delivers insulin in increments of 1 unit up to a maximum single dose of 80 units. </p>
<p>Method of administration </p>
<p>Semglee is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject Semglee in a vein, since this will change its action 
and may cause hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Semglee. With each injection, 
change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. </p>
<p>How to handle Semglee pen </p>
<p>Semglee in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method. </p>
<p>Read carefully the "Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen 
as described in these Instructions for Use. </p>
<p>A new needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that are compatible with Semglee 
pen (see  Instructions for Use ). 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. </p>
<p>Look at the cartridge before you use the pen. Do not use Semglee if you notice particles in the 
solution. Only use Semglee if the solution is clear and colourless. Do not shake or mix it before use. </p>
<p>To prevent the possible transmission of disease, never share your pen with anyone else. This pen is 
only for your use. </p>
<p>Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with Semglee pen, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. </p>
<p>Do not use Semglee pen if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to 
be discarded and a new Semglee pen has to be used. </p>
<p>Insulin mix-ups </p>
<p>You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Semglee and 
other insulins. </p>
<p>If you use more Semglee than you should </p>
<p>If you have injected too much Semglee, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must 
eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see 
box at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Semglee </p>
<p>If you have missed a dose of Semglee or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar 
level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on 
the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Semglee </p>
<p>This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Semglee without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase your 
blood sugar level straight away (see the box at the end of this leaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood 
sugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood. If your blood sugar 
level falls too low you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain 
damage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Severe allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)   the signs may include large-scale 
skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes 
(angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. Severe 
allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away if you notice 
signs of severe allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site 
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy; may 
affect up to 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy; may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps 
under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; 
how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy 
area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. </p>
<p>Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) </p>
<p>Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
The signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or 
inflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually 
disappear in a few days to a few weeks. </p>
<p>Rare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) </p>
<p>Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. </p>
<p>General disorders 
In rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling 
in the calves and ankles. </p>
<p>Very rare reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) 
In very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
In general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those 
seen in adults. 
Complaints of injection site reactions (injection site reaction, injection site pain) and skin reactions 
(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age 
or less than in adults. 
There is no experience in children under 2 years. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of
