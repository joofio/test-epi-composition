Shingrix is a vaccine that helps to protect adults against shingles (herpes zoster) and post-herpetic 
neuralgia (PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles. </p>
<p>Shingrix is given to:<br />
  adults 50 years and above; 
  adults 18 years and above who are at increased risk of shingles. </p>
<p>Shingrix cannot be used to prevent chickenpox (varicella). </p>
<p>What shingles is 
* Shingles is a rash with blisters that is often painful. It usually occurs in one part of the body and 
can last for several weeks. 
* Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox.<br />
* After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. 
* Sometimes, after many years, if your immune system (the body s natural defences) becomes 
weaker (due to age, an illness or a medicine you are taking), the virus can cause shingles. </p>
<p>Complications related to shingles 
Shingles may lead to complications.<br />
The most common complication of shingles is: 
* long-lasting nerve pain   called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. After the shingles blisters heal, 
you may get pain which can last for months or years and may be severe. 
Other complications of shingles are: 
* scars where the blisters have been. 
* skin infections, weakness, muscle paralysis and loss of hearing or vision   these are less 
common. </p>
<p>How Shingrix works 
Shingrix reminds your body about the virus that causes shingles. This helps your immune system (the 
body s natural defences) stay prepared to fight the virus and protect you against shingles and its 
complications. </p>         </div>"""

* you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in 
section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and 
swelling of the face or tongue. 
You must not be given Shingrix if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you receive Shingrix if: 
* you have a severe infection with a high temperature (fever). In these cases, the vaccination may 
have to be postponed until you have recovered. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a 
problem, but talk to your doctor first; 
* you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you 
receive Shingrix. </p>
<p>Fainting can occur before or after any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted 
with a previous injection. </p>
<p>Shingrix cannot be used as a treatment if you already have shingles or shingles-related complications. </p>
<p>As with all vaccines, Shingrix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you experience temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness, 
and paralysis (called Guillain-Barr  syndrome) after receiving Shingrix. A slightly increased risk of 
Guillain-Barr  syndrome (estimated 3 additional cases per million doses administered) has been 
reported in people aged 65 years and above after receiving Shingrix. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Shingrix 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or have recently received any other 
vaccine. </p>
<p>Shingrix can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal 
influenza vaccine, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine, reduced antigen diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis vaccine, or COVID-mRNA vaccine. A different injection site will be used for each vaccine. </p>
<p>You may be more likely to experience fever and/or shivering when 23-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine is given at the same time as Shingrix.  </p>
<p>You may be more likely to experience chills, tiredness, fever, stomach and digestive complaints 
(including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or stomach pain), headache, muscle pain, or joint pain 
when a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is given at the same time as Shingrix.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some of the effects mentioned below in section 4  Possible side effects  may temporarily affect the 
ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell. </p>
<p>Shingrix contains sodium and potassium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .<br />
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
 potassium-free . </p>         </div>"""
