<p>Silodosin Recordati belongs to a group of medicines called alpha1A-adrenoreceptor blockers. 
Silodosin Recordati is selective for the receptors located in the prostate, bladder and urethra. By 
blocking these receptors, it causes smooth muscle in these tissues to relax. This makes it easier for you 
to pass water and relieves your symptoms. </p>
<p>What Silodosin Recordati is used for </p>
<p>Silodosin Recordati is used in adult men to treat the urinary symptoms associated with benign 
enlargement of the prostate (prostatic hyperplasia), such as: 
* difficulty in starting to pass water, 
* a feeling of not completely emptying the bladder, 
* a more frequent need to pass water, even at night. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Silodosin Recordati </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are undergoing eye surgery because of cloudiness of the lens (cataract surgery), it is 
important that you immediately inform your eye specialist that you are using or have previously 
used Silodosin Recordati. This is because some patients treated with this kind of medicine 
experienced a loss of muscle tone in the iris (the coloured circular part of the eye) during such a 
surgery. The specialist can take appropriate precautions with respect to medicine and surgical 
techniques to be used. Ask your doctor whether or not you should postpone or temporarily stop 
taking Silodosin Recordati when undergoing cataract surgery. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have ever fainted or felt dizzy when suddenly standing up, please inform your doctor 
before taking Silodosin Recordati.<br />
Dizziness when standing up and occasionally fainting may occur when taking Silodosin 
Recordati, particularly when starting treatment or if you are taking other medicines that lower 
blood pressure. If this occurs, make sure you sit or lie down straight away until the symptoms 
have disappeared and inform your doctor as soon as possible (see also section  Driving and 
using machines ).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have severe liver problems, you should not take Silodosin Recordati, as it was not tested 
in this condition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have problems with your kidneys, please ask your doctor for advice.<br />
If you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor will start Silodosin Recordati with caution 
and possibly with a lower dose (see section 3  Dose ).<br />
If you have severe kidney problems, you should not take Silodosin Recordati. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since a benign enlargement of the prostate and prostate cancer may present the same symptoms, 
your doctor will check you for prostate cancer before starting treatment with Silodosin 
Recordati. Silodosin Recordati does not treat prostate cancer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment with Silodosin Recordati may lead to an abnormal ejaculation (decrease in the 
amount of semen released during sex) that may temporarily affect male fertility. This effect 
disappears after discontinuation of Silodosin Recordati. Please inform your doctor if you are 
planning to have children. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years since there is no relevant 
indication for this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Silodosin Recordati </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor in particular, if you take: 
* medicines which lower blood pressure (in particular, medicines called alpha1-blockers, such 
as prazosin or doxazosin) as there may be the potential risk that the effect of these medicines is 
increased whilst taking Silodosin Recordati. 
* antifungal medicines (such as ketoconazole or itraconazole), medicines used for HIV-AIDS 
(such as ritonavir) or medicines used after transplants to prevent organ rejection (such as 
cyclosporin) because these medicines can increase the blood concentration of Silodosin 
Recordati. 
* medicines used for treating problems in getting or keeping an erection (such as sildenafil or 
tadalafil), since the concomitant use with Silodosin Recordati might lead to a slight decrease in 
blood pressure.<br />
* medicines for epilepsy or rifampicin (a medicine to treat tubercolosis), since the effect of 
Silodosin Recordati may be reduced. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Silodosin Recordati is not intended for use by women. </p>
<p>Fertilty </p>
<p>Silodosin Recordati may reduce the amount of sperm, and so could temporarily affect your ability to 
father a child. If you are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before 
taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Do not drive or operate machines if you feel faint, dizzy, drowsy or have blurred vision. </p>
<p>Silodosin Recordati contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Patients with kidney problems<br />
If you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a different dose. For this purpose 
Silodosin Recordati 4 mg hard capsules are available. </p>
<p>If you take more Silodosin Recordati than you should </p>
