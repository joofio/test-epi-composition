- if you are allergic to brinzolamide or brimonidine tartrate or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) 
- if you are allergic to sulphonamides (examples include medicines used to treat diabetes and 
infections and also diuretics (water tablets)) 
- if you are taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (examples include medicines to treat 
depression or Parkinson s disease) or certain antidepressants. You must inform your doctor if 
you are taking any antidepressant medicines 
- if you have severe kidney problems

- in babies and infants aged less than 2 years. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist before using SIMBRINZA if you have now 
or have had in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>liver problems </li>
<li>a type of high pressure in the eyes called narrow-angle glaucoma </li>
<li>dry eyes or cornea problems </li>
<li>coronary heart disease (symptoms can include chest pain or tightness, breathlessness or 
choking), heart failure, high or low blood pressure </li>
<li>depression </li>
<li>disturbed or poor blood circulation (such as Raynaud s disease, Raynaud s syndrome or cerebral 
insufficiency). </li>
<li>if you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores after 
using SIMBRINZA or other related medicines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Take special care with SIMBRINZA: 
Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been 
reported in association with brinzolamide treatment. Stop using SIMBRINZA and seek medical 
attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to these serious skin reactions 
described in section 4. If you wear soft contact lenses, do not use the drops with your lenses in. See section  Wearing contact 
lenses - SIMBRINZA contains benzalkonium chloride  below). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
SIMBRINZA is not intended for use by children and adolescents aged below 18 years because it has 
not been studied in this age group. It is particularly important that the medicine is not used in children 
under the age of 2 years (see section  Do not use SIMBRINZA  above) because it is unlikely to be 
safe. </p>
<p>Other medicines and SIMBRINZA 
Tell your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might 
use any other medicines. </p>
<p>SIMBRINZA can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for 
the treatment of glaucoma. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking or intend to take any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines to lower blood pressure </li>
<li>heart medicines including digoxin (used to treat heart conditions) </li>
<li>other medicines for glaucoma that also treat altitude sickness known as acetazolamide, 
methazolamide and dorzolamide </li>
<li>medicines that can affect the metabolism, such as chlorpromazine, methylphenidate and 
reserpine </li>
<li>antiviral, antiretroviral (used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)) or antibiotic 
medicines </li>
<li>antiyeast or antifungal medicines </li>
<li>monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, or antidepressants including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, 
clomipramine, mianserin, venlafaxine and duloxetine </li>
<li>anaesthetics </li>
<li>sedatives, opiates, or barbiturates </li>
</ul>
<p>You should also tell your doctor if the dose of any of your current medicines is changed. </p>
<p>SIMBRINZA with alcohol 
If you regularly consume alcohol, ask your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist for advice 
before taking this medicine. SIMBRINZA can be affected by alcohol. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
optometrist (optician) or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Women who may become 
pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during SIMBRINZA treatment. The use of 
SIMBRINZA is not recommended during pregnancy. Do not use SIMBRINZA unless clearly 
indicated by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, SIMBRINZA may pass into your milk. The use of SIMBRINZA is not 
recommended during breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may find that your vision is blurred or abnormal for a time just after using SIMBRINZA. 
SIMBRINZA may also cause dizziness, drowsiness or tiredness in some patients. </p>
<p>Do not drive or use machines until the symptoms are cleared. </p>
<p>Wearing contact lenses - SIMBRINZA contains benzalkonium chloride </p>
<p>This medicine contains 0.15 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 5 ml, which is equivalent to 
0.03 mg/ml. </p>
<p>Benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the 
contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back 
15 minutes afterwards. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have 
dry eyes or a disorder of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye 
sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

Check with your doctor, optometrist (optician) or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Only use SIMBRINZA for your eyes. Do not swallow or inject. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye or eyes two times a day. Use at the same time 
each day. </p>
<p>How to use </p>
<p>Wash your hands before you start. </p>
<p>1 
2 </p>
<p>Shake well before use. 
Twist off the bottle cap. After the cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar is loose, remove it 
before using the medicine. 
Do not touch the dropper with your fingers when opening or closing the bottle. It could infect the 
drops. 
Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. 
Tilt your head back. 
Pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a  pocket  between the eyelid and your 
eye. The drop will go in here (picture 1). 
Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps. 
Do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could infect 
the drops. 
Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of SIMBRINZA. 
Do not squeeze the bottle: it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs 
(picture 2). </p>
<p>To reduce the amount of medicine that could come into the rest of the body after application of the eye 
drop, close your eye and apply gentle pressure to the corner of the eye next to the nose with a finger 
for at least 2 minutes. </p>
<p>If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. It is not necessary to close and 
shake the bottle before you apply the drop in your other eye. Close the bottle cap firmly immediately 
after use. </p>
<p>If you are using other eye drops as well as SIMBRINZA, wait at least five minutes between using 
SIMBRINZA and the other drops. </p>
<p>If a drop misses your eye, try again. </p>
<p>If you use more SIMBRINZA than you should 
Rinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular 
dose. </p>
<p>Adults who accidentally swallowed medicines containing brimonidine experienced a decreased heart 
rate, decreased blood pressure which may be followed by increased blood pressure, heart failure, 
difficulty breathing and effects in the nervous system. Should this happen, contact your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>Serious side effects have been reported in children who accidently swallowed medicines containing 
brimonidine. Signs included sleepiness, floppiness, low body temperature, paleness and breathing 
difficulties. Should this happen, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If SIMBRINZA has been accidentally swallowed then you should contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to use SIMBRINZA 
Continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do 
not use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) two times a day. </p>
<p>If you stop using SIMBRINZA 
Do not stop using SIMBRINZA without first speaking to your doctor. If you stop using SIMBRINZA 
the pressure in your eye will not be controlled, which could lead to loss of sight. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, optometrist (optician) or 
pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
