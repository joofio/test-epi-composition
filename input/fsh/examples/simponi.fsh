Simponi belongs to a group of medicines called  TNF blockers . It is used in children 2 years of age 
and older for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Simponi works by blocking the action of a protein called  tumour necrosis factor alpha  (TNF- ). This 
protein is involved in inflammatory processes of the body, and blocking it can reduce the 
inflammation in your body.
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease that causes joint pain and swelling 
in children. If you have polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Simponi in 
combination with methotrexate to treat the disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you have tuberculosis (TB) or any other severe infection.</p>
<p>If you have moderate or severe heart failure.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using Simponi.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Simponi.
Infections
Tell your doctor straight away if you already have or get any symptoms of infection, during or after 
your treatment with Simponi. Symptoms of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath, flu-like 
symptoms, diarrhoea, wounds, dental problems or a burning feeling when urinating.</p>
<p>You may get infections more easily while using Simponi.</p>
<p>Infections may progress more rapidly and may be more severe. In addition, some previous 
infections may reappear.
Tuberculosis (TB)
Tell your doctor straight away if symptoms of TB appear during or after your treatment. 
Symptoms of TB include persistent cough, weight loss, tiredness, fever or night sweats.</p>
<p>Cases of TB have been reported in patients treated with Simponi, in rare occasions even 
in patients who have been treated with medicines for TB. Your doctor will test you to see 
if you have TB. Your doctor will record these tests on your Patient Reminder Card.</p>
<p>It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had TB, or if you have been 
in close contact with someone who has had or has TB.</p>
<p>If your doctor feels that you are at risk of TB, you may be treated with medicines for TB 
before you begin using Simponi.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV)</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are a carrier or if you have or have had HBV before you are given 
Simponi.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV</p>
<p>Your doctor should test you for HBV</p>
<p>Treatment with TNF blockers such as Simponi may result in reactivation of HBV in 
patients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases.
Invasive fungal infections
If you have lived in or travelled to an area where infections caused by specific type of fungi that 
can affect the lungs or other parts of the body (called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or 
blastomycosis), are common, tell your doctor straight away. Ask your doctor if you don t know 
if these fungal infections are common in the area in which you have lived or travelled.
Cancer and lymphoma
Tell your doctor if you have ever been diagnosed with lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other 
cancer before you use Simponi.</p>
<p>If you use Simponi or other TNF blockers, your risk for developing lymphoma or another 
cancer may increase.</p>
<p>Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, who have had the 
disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing lymphoma.</p>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, including unusual types, in children and teenage patients 
taking TNF-blocking agents, which sometimes resulted in death.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma called hepatosplenic T-cell 
lymphoma has been observed in patients taking other TNF-blockers. Most of these patients 
were adolescent or young adult males. This type of cancer has usually resulted in death. Almost 
all of these patients had also received medicines known as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Simponi.</p>
<p>Patients with severe persistent asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or are 
heavy smokers may be at increased risk for cancer with Simponi treatment. If you have severe 
persistent asthma, COPD or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether 
treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.</p>
<p>Some patients treated with golimumab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. If any 
changes in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin occur during or after therapy, tell 
your doctor.
Heart failure
Tell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening symptoms of heart failure. Symptoms of 
heart failure include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet.</p>
<p>New and worsening congestive heart failure has been reported with TNF blockers, including 
Simponi. Some of these patients died.</p>
<p>If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Simponi, you must be closely 
monitored by your doctor.
Nervous system disease
Tell your doctor straight away if you have ever been diagnosed with or develop symptoms of a 
demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. Symptoms may include changes in your vision, 
weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. Your doctor will 
decide if you should receive Simponi.
Operations or dental procedures</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures.</p>
<p>Tell your surgeon or dentist performing the procedure that you are having treatment with 
Simponi by showing them your Patient Reminder Card.
Autoimmune disease
Tell your doctor if you develop symptoms of a disease called lupus. Symptoms include persistent rash, 
fever, joint pain and tiredness.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, people treated with TNF blockers have developed lupus.
Blood disease
In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight 
infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or bleed 
very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Simponi.
Vaccinations
Talk to your doctor if you have had, or are due to have a vaccine.</p>
<p>You should not receive certain (live) vaccines while using Simponi.</p>
<p>Certain vaccinations may cause infections. If you received Simponi while you were pregnant, 
your baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately six months 
after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's 
doctors and other health care professionals about your Simponi use so they can decide when 
your baby should receive any vaccine.
Talk to your child s doctor regarding vaccinations for your child. If possible, your child should be up 
to date with all vaccinations before using Simponi.
Therapeutic infectious agents
Talk to your doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment with a 
therapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used for the treatment of cancer).
Allergic reactions
Tell your doctor straight away if you develop symptoms of an allergic reaction after your treatment 
with Simponi. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include swelling of the face, lips, mouth or throat 
which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing, skin rash, hives, swelling of the hands, feet or 
ankles.</p>
<p>Some of these reactions may be serious or, rarely, life-threatening.</p>
<p>Some of these reactions occurred after the first administration of Simponi.
Children
Simponi is not recommended for children less than 2 years of age with polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis because it has not been studied in this group.
Other medicines and Simponi</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines, including any other medicines to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.</p>
<p>You should not take Simponi with medicines containing the active substance anakinra or 
abatacept. These medicines are used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines that affect your immune 
system.</p>
<p>You should not receive certain (live) vaccines while using Simponi.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Simponi.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Talk to your doctor before using Simponi if:</p>
<p>You are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant while using Simponi. There is limited 
information about the effects of this medicine in pregnant women. If you are being treated with 
Simponi, you must avoid becoming pregnant by using adequate contraception during your 
treatment and for at least 6 months after the last Simponi injection. Simponi should only be used 
during pregnancy if it is clearly necessary for you.</p>
<p>Before starting breast-feeding, your last treatment with Simponi must be at least 6 months ago. 
You must stop breast-feeding if you are to be given Simponi.</p>
<p>If you received Simponi during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals 
about your Simponi use before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 
on vaccination).
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Simponi has minor influence on your ability to ride bicycles, drive and use tools or machines. 
Dizziness may however occur after you take Simponi. If this happens, do not ride bicycles, drive or 
use any tools or machines.
Simponi contains latex and sorbitol
Latex sensitivity
A part of the pre-filled pen, the needle cover, contains latex. Because latex may cause severe allergic 
reactions, talk to your doctor before using Simponi if you or your carer are allergic to latex.
Sorbitol intolerance
This medicine contains 18.45 mg sorbitol (E420) in each pre-filled pen. Each 0.05 mL medicine 
contains 2.05 mg sorbitol (E420).</p>         </div>"""

When to inject your next dose:</p>
<p>If you are less than 2 weeks late, inject the forgotten dose as soon as you remember and stay on 
your original schedule.</p>
