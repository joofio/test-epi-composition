<p>Patients who may not be investigated using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan must not be

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Sixmo if you have: 
* asthma or other breathing problems 
* mild or moderate liver problems 
* reduced kidney function 
* head injury or other circumstances where the pressure in the head may be increased 
* a history of fits 
* low blood pressure 
* enlarged prostate or narrowed urethra 
* underactive thyroid 
* reduced adrenal gland function, such as Addison's disease 
* abnormal function of the bile duct 
* general weakness and poor health, or you are elderly 
* a history of connective tissue disease such as scleroderma 
* a history of recurrent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections (MRSA) 
* depression or other conditions that are treated with antidepressants.<br />
The use of these medicines together with Sixmo can lead to serotonin syndrome, a potentially 
life-threatening condition (see  Other medicines and Sixmo ). </p>
<p>Important aspects to consider during treatment: 
* Drowsiness may occur especially in the first week after insertion. See  Driving and using 
machines . 
* Your doctor should examine the insertion site for infections and wound problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>one week after implant insertion and </li>
<li>at least once a month thereafter </li>
<li>Infection may occur at the site of the insertion or removal of the implant. Excessive touching 
of the implants or insertion site shortly after insertion may increase the chance of infection. Tell 
your doctor immediately if you have any signs of infection (such as redness or inflammation) at 
the site of insertion or removal. </li>
<li>
<p>If an implant comes out after insertion, take the following steps:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schedule an appointment with the inserting doctor as soon as possible. </p>
</li>
<li>Place the implant in a glass jar with a lid. Store it safely away from others, especially 
children. Bring it to the inserting doctor to determine whether the full implant has been 
expelled. 
Please note: Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, breathing depression 
(shortness of breath or stops breathing) in children who are accidentally exposed to it. </li>
<li>The doctor will monitor you until the implant is replaced to evaluate for withdrawal 
symptoms. </li>
<li>Avoid moving implants around under the skin or gain a lot of weight after insertion of Sixmo as 
this may make it difficult to locate implants. </li>
<li>Misuse and abuse: If buprenorphine is abused it can lead to overdose and death. This risk 
increases when additionally using alcohol or other substances. </li>
<li>This medicine can cause dependence, but at a lower level than other substances such as 
morphine. If you stop Sixmo treatment your doctor will monitor you for withdrawal 
symptoms. </li>
<li>A number of cases of death due to breathing depression have been reported while on 
buprenorphine. Particularly, this occurs when additionally using alcohol, other opioids or certain 
medicines which calm, induce sleep or relax muscles. Buprenorphine can cause fatal breathing 
problems in non-dependent people or children. 
Sixmo should be used with caution in patients with asthma or other breathing problems. </li>
<li>Liver damage, including liver failure, has been reported when using buprenorphine. This may 
be related to existing reduced liver function and ongoing injecting drug use. If liver problems 
are suspected your doctor will carry out tests to decide if treatment should be stopped.  </li>
<li>While using Sixmo, situations may arise where you need acute pain treatment or anaesthesia. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice in these cases. </li>
<li>Substances like buprenorphine may cause pinpoint pupils, change consciousness or the way 
you feel pain. </li>
<li>Substances like buprenorphine may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, causing dizziness 
when getting up quickly. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Sixmo is not recommended for children under 18 years.  </p>
<p>Patients over 65 years 
Sixmo is not recommended for patients over 65 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sixmo </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Especially, inform your doctor during Sixmo treatment before using:<br />
<em> medicines which calm, induce sleep or relax muscles, with active substance names ending with 
 azepam<br />
This combination may result in death due to breathing depression. Therefore, use these 
medicines during Sixmo treatment only on doctor s advice and at the prescribed dosage.<br />
</em> other medicines that depress the brain or spinal cord, as these reduce alertness, making driving 
and using machines hazardous 
- other opioid derivatives such as methadone, strong painkillers and cough suppressants 
- certain medicines to treat depressions 
- medicines called antihistamines used to treat allergic reactions, sleep disturbances, cold; 
or prevent and treat nausea and vomiting 
- medicines to treat epilepsy or to sedate, with active substance names mostly ending with 
 tal<br />
- medicines to treat anxiety, other than those described in the first bullet point 
- medicines to treat mental or anxiety disorders, with sedative effects, called neuroleptics 
- clonidine: a medicine to treat high blood pressure and high eye pressure 
* naltrexone, nalmefene, used to treat addiction 
They can block the effects of buprenorphine. Do not use these medicines during Sixmo 
treatment as they can cause a sudden onset of prolonged, intense withdrawal symptoms.<br />
* medicines to treat HIV infections with active substance names ending in  navir , such as 
ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir 
* medicines to treat fungal infections, like thrush, with active substance names ending in  azole , 
such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole 
* clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin: medicines to treat bacterial infections 
* nefazodone: a medicine to treat depression 
* verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone: medicines to treat high blood pressure and heart disorders 
* aprepitant: a medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting 
* phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin: medicines to treat epilepsy and other illnesses 
* rifampicin: a medicine to treat tuberculosis or certain other infections 
* certain medicines to treat depression or Parkinson s disease, called monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors, such as phenelzine, isocarboxazid, iproniazid and tranylcypromine 
* anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, doxepine, or 
trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Sixmo and you may experience symptoms 
such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the muscles that control 
movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive sweating, tremor, exaggeration 
of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature above 38 C. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms. </p>
<p>Sixmo with food, drink and alcohol </p>
<p>Do not drink alcohol during Sixmo treatment, as it increases the sedative effect. 
Avoid grapefruit juice to prevent possible side effects. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
* pregnancy 
Sixmo is not recommended during pregnancy, nor in women of childbearing age not using 
contraception. 
When used during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, buprenorphine may cause withdrawal 
symptoms, including breathing problems, in the newborn baby. This may appear several days 
after birth. 
* breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during Sixmo treatment, as buprenorphine passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Buprenorphine may reduce the ability to drive and use machines; especially during the first 24 to 
48 hours up to one week following implant insertion. You may fell dizzy, drowsy and less alert. 
Do not drive or perform dangerous activities until you are certain Sixmo does not reduce your ability 
in such activities. </p>         </div>"""

sure. 
Sixmo implants must be inserted, removed, and patients monitored by a healthcare professional 
familiar with the procedure, with experience in the management of opioid addiction. </p>
<p>Before administering Sixmo implants </p>
<p>You must be on a stable buprenorphine dose of between 2 to 8 mg per day, given under the tongue. 
This must be for at least 30 days and to be decided by your doctor. </p>
<p>Buprenorphine given under the tongue will be stopped 12 to 24 hours before insertion of Sixmo 
implants. </p>
<p>Treatment with Sixmo implants </p>
<p>Each dose consists of 4 implants. </p>
<p>Before inserting Sixmo, your doctor will give you a local anaesthetic to numb the area. The implants 
will then be inserted under the skin in the inner side of the upper arm. </p>
<p>After insertion of the implants, the doctor will apply a sterile gauze with a pressure bandage to 
minimize bruising. You may remove the pressure bandage after 24 hours and the adhesive bandage 
after five days. Apply an ice pack on the arm for 40 minutes every two hours for the first 24 hours, 
then as needed. </p>
<p>Your doctor will also give you a Patient Alert Card that provides the 
* insertion site and date 
* latest date on which the implant must be removed 
Keep this card in a safe place, since the information on the card may make it easier to carry out 
removal.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will examine the insertion site one week following implant insertion and at a minimum 
once-monthly thereafter for signs of: 
* infection or any problems with wound healing 
* evidence of implant coming out of the skin 
Please attend all of these necessary appointments. Inform your doctor immediately if you think you have 
an infection at the implant site or if the implant starts to come out. </p>
<p>If you feel the need for additional buprenorphine doses, contact your doctor straight away.  </p>
<p>Removal of Sixmo implants </p>
<p>Sixmo implants are intended to be in place for 6 months and provide a continuous delivery of 
buprenorphine. They are removed by the doctor at the end of the sixth month. </p>
<p>The implants should only be removed by a doctor who is familiar with the procedure. If the implants 
cannot be located, the doctor may use ultrasound or a type of scan called magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI).  </p>
<p>After removal of the implant, the doctor will apply a sterile gauze with a pressure bandage to minimize 
bruising. You may remove the pressure bandage after 24 hours and the adhesive bandage after five 
days. Apply an ice pack on the arm for 40 minutes every two hours for the first 24 hours, then as 
needed. </p>
<p>Retreatment with Sixmo implants </p>
<p>When the first 6-month treatment period is up, a new set of Sixmo implants may be given after 
removal of the old implants, preferably on the same day. New implants will be inserted in the other 
arm. </p>
<p>If another set of implants is not inserted on the same day as the previous set is removed: 
A dose of between 2 and 8 mg buprenorphine daily, given under the tongue, is recommended until 
repeat treatment occurs. This should be stopped 12 to 24 hours before insertion of the next set of 
Sixmo implants. </p>
<p>If you have more Sixmo than you need </p>
<p>In some cases, the dose delivered by the implants might be more than the one you need. Overdose 
symptoms include:<br />
* pinpoint pupils 
* sedation 
* low blood pressure 
* breathing difficulties, breathing slowly 
In the worst case, it can result in breathing stopping, heart failure and death. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor immediately if the above symptoms occur, or go to the nearest hospital and bring 
this leaflet and your Patient Alert Card with you. Do not attempt to remove the implants by yourself as 
this could be very dangerous. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
