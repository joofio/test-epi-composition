Skyclarys contains the active substance omaveloxolone, which activates a specific protein, Nrf2, in 
your body. </p>
<p>What is Skyclarys used for? 
Skyclarys is used to treat adults and adolescents who are at least 16 years of age who have Friedreich s 
ataxia, a neurodegenerative movement disorder. Friedreich s ataxia is a rare inherited disease that 
causes progressive damage to your nervous system and movement problems. </p>
<p>How does Skyclarys work? 
The protein called Nrf2 in your body has a key role in managing oxidative stress (a condition that can 
damage cells in your body) and has a protective role against neurodegenerative diseases. In patients 
with Friedreich s ataxia, Nrf2 activity is reduced. Skyclarys activates Nrf2 so it can manage oxidative 
stress. </p>
<p>In a clinical trial patients treated with Skyclarys scored better on tests of neurological function than 
patients who were treated with an inactive substance. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Skyclarys:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have problems with your liver, your doctor may decide to change the dose or not start 
treatment with Skyclarys. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking before you start Skyclarys. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will check to see how well your liver is working and will check your cholesterol level 
before you start taking Skyclarys. Your doctor will also check your level of BNP (B-type natriuretic 
peptide, a blood test for heart problems) before you start taking Skyclarys. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor while taking Skyclarys 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have sudden weight gain, swelling of legs, ankles, or feet, or 
shortness of breath, which may be signs or symptoms of heart problems while taking Skyclarys. Your 
doctor will decide on treatment and whether Skyclarys should be continued. </p>
<p>Your doctor will be checking blood tests while you are taking Skyclarys. This will include liver blood 
tests to see how your liver is working while taking Skyclarys. Your doctor will decide on whether to 
discontinue Skyclarys if liver problems develop. Other blood tests that your doctor will do will check 
cholesterol and BNP after you start Skyclarys. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have weight loss with Skyclarys. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give Skyclarys to children and adolescents below the age of 16 years because it has not yet 
been studied in this group of patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Skyclarys 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. This is 
because some medicines may affect the way Skyclarys works. Also, Skyclarys may affect the way 
some medicines work. </p>
<p>Certain medicines may increase the risk of side effects of Skyclarys by increasing the levels of 
Skyclarys in the blood. Some of these medicines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>itraconazole, fluconazole, or ketoconazole (antifungal medicines used to treat a number of 
fungal infections) </li>
<li>cyclosporine (a medicine used after organ transplant) </li>
<li>ciprofloxacin or clarithromycin (antibiotics used for bacterial infections) </li>
<li>fluvoxamine (an antidepressant known as a selective serotinin reuptake inibitor [SSRI]) 
If your doctor prescribes one of these medicines, your dose of Skyclarys may be reduced to prevent 
side effects when taking both drugs at the same time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Certain medicines may reduce how well Skyclarys works by decreasing the amount of Skyclarys in the 
blood. Some of these medicines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>St. John s wort (a herbal remedy used for mild depression) </li>
<li>rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone (used to treat epilepsy) </li>
<li>efavirenz (medicine used for HIV) </li>
</ul>
<p>Skyclarys may reduce how well some other medicines work by decreasing the amount of these 
medicines in the blood. Some of these medicines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>midazolam (used as a sedative and to treat severe agitation) </li>
<li>repaglinide (a medicine to control type II diabetes) </li>
<li>rosuvastatin (a statin medicine used to reduce harmful lipids) </li>
<li>hormonal contraceptives (a type of birth control that uses homones to prevent pregnancy, such 
as the pill, patch, or ring) </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are taking any medicines, particularly those mentioned above, as they may 
affect the way Skyclarys or other medicines work. </p>
<p>Skyclarys with food and drink 
Avoid eating grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking Skyclarys. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
You should not take Skyclarys if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have 
a baby. Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are being treated with 
Skyclarys. </p>
<p>Birth Control 
Using Skyclarys can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal birth control. You should use a different 
method of birth control, such as a non-hormonal IUD (intrauterine device) or barrier contraceptives 
such as condoms. A reliable method of birth control should be used during Skyclarys treatment and for 
28 days after stopping treatment with Skyclarys. Talk to your doctor about the most suitable birth 
control for you. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed your baby while you are being treated with Skyclarys. It is not known if this 
medicine passes into the breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some patients may feel tired after taking this medicine. If you feel tired after taking Skyclarys, avoid 
driving and using machines. </p>
<p>Skyclarys contains a negligible amount of sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free . </p>         </div>"""
