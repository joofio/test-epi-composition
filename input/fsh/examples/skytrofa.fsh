needed for bones and muscles to grow and helps your body to develop the right amount of fat and 
muscle tissues.  </p>
<p>Skytrofa is used to treat children and adolescents, aged 3 up to 18 years, who have failed to grow 
because their body produces no growth hormone or not enough. Doctors call this growth hormone 
deficiency (GHD). After injection, Skytrofa is slowly converted into somatropin, supplying the 
missing growth hormone. </p>         </div>"""

<em> If you are allergic to lonapegsomatropin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6) 
* If you have a tumour (cancer) which is growing. You must have finished your anti-tumour 
treatment, and tumours must be inactive before you start your treatment with Skytrofa<br />
</em> If you have recently had an open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma 
or acute respiratory failure </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have been told by your doctor that the parts of your bones that grow and increase height 
(growth plates or epiphyses) have closed and stopped growing </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor before starting the treatment if any of these apply to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Skytrofa. It is especially important to talk about 
anything mentioned below: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you previously had an intracranial tumour, a doctor will examine you regularly during your 
treatment for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer. </li>
<li>If you develop a strong headache, disturbed vision, vomiting or inability to coordinate 
voluntary muscle movements (ataxia), especially in the first few weeks of treatment, tell your 
doctor straight away. These may be signs of raised pressure in the skull (intracranial pressure). 
See section 4, possible side effects. </li>
<li>If you have diabetes mellitus, high blood sugar (glucose intolerance), or additional risk factors 
for diabetes, your blood sugar may need to be checked regularly and the dose of your diabetes 
medicine may need to be adjusted. </li>
<li>If you are being treated for adrenal insufficiency with corticosteroids, talk to your doctor, as 
your steroid dose may need regular adjustment. </li>
<li>If you are being treated with thyroid hormones or you need to start thyroid hormone 
replacement, your doctor will test your thyroid function regularly and the dose may need to be 
adjusted. </li>
<li>If you have persistent hip or knee pain when walking, or if you start to limp during your growth 
hormone treatment, tell your doctor. These could be symptoms of a condition that affects the 
thighbone (femur) where it inserts into the hip (slipped capital femoral epiphysis) and that 
occurs with greater frequency in children on growth hormone therapy. </li>
<li>If you notice a sideways curve in your spine (scoliosis), you will need to be checked often by 
your doctor. </li>
<li>If you get a stomach ache (pain in your tummy) that gets worse, tell your doctor. Your doctor 
may test for pancreatitis, which is when an organ called the pancreas becomes inflamed. See 
section 4, possible side effects. </li>
<li>If you have signs and symptoms of a sudden serious allergic reaction (e.g. breathing 
difficulty, swelling of your face, mouth, or tongue, fast heartbeat, hives, rash, fever), you should 
promptly seek medical attention.  </li>
<li>If you have Prader-Willi syndrome, you should not be treated with Skytrofa unless you also 
have GHD. Skytrofa has not been studied in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome and 
therefore its effectiveness as a treatment for this condition is unknown. </li>
<li>A small number of patients given growth hormone replacement have developed a type of 
cancer of the blood and bone marrow (leukaemia). However, it has not been proven that 
growth hormone treatment caused the cancer. </li>
<li>If you have immediate complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, a bad 
accident (trauma), or an acute critical illness like acute respiratory failure. </li>
<li>If you are a female taking oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with 
oestrogen, your dose of Skytrofa may need to be higher. If you or your child stop using oral 
oestrogen, your dose of Skytrofa may need to be reduced. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Skytrofa<br />
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following medicines:<br />
* Insulin or any other medicines to treat diabetes mellitus 
* Thyroid hormone treatments such as levothyroxine </p>
<ul>
<li>Tablets containing oestrogen, including tablets for oestrogen replacement therapy or for 
contraception  </li>
<li>Steroids or synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids or glucocorticoids) </li>
<li>Medicines to treat epilepsy or fits (seizures) - antiseizure medicines (anticonvulsants) such as 
carbamazepine </li>
<li>Ciclosporin (immunosuppressive medicine) - a medicine to suppress your immune system </li>
<li>Theophylline, a medicine used to treat asthma and other chronic lung diseases </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of Skytrofa. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are able to get pregnant, you should not use Skytrofa unless you are also using reliable 
contraception. There are no data from the use of Skytrofa in pregnant women. Skytrofa is not to be 
used during pregnancy. This is because it is not known if it could harm your unborn child. If you are 
pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor. If you 
become pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Breastfeeding 
It is not known whether Skytrofa can pass into breast milk. However, as lonapegsomatropin is not 
absorbed by mouth, it is unlikely to adversely affect the breastfed infant. If you are breast-feeding or 
intend to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before using Skytrofa. Skytrofa can be used during 
breastfeeding on strict indication. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Skytrofa does not affect the ability to drive or to use machines.  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>This medicine will only be prescribed by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone treatment 
and who has confirmed your diagnosis. </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. Your doctor will show you how to use Skytrofa. </p>
<p>Skytrofa is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). This means that it is injected 
with a short needle into fatty tissue under the skin of the abdomen, buttock or thigh. It is important to 
change the place where you have your injection every week to avoid damaging your skin. Your doctor 
or nurse will tell you the right dose and show you how to give the injection when you start treatment. </p>
<p>Recommended dose 
Your doctor will work out your dose of Skytrofa from your body weight in kilograms. Because 
lonapegsomatropin is converted into somatropin in the body, doses of Skytrofa are described in terms 
of the amount of somatropin it produces. The recommended dose of Skytrofa is 0.24 mg somatropin 
per kilogram of body weight, given once a week.  </p>
<p>If changing from daily somatropin therapy to once-weekly Skytrofa, your doctor will tell you to wait 
at least 8 hours between the final dose of once-daily somatropin and the first dose of Skytrofa. The 
recommended dose may be reduced according to previous daily dose of somatropin. </p>
<p>When to use Skytrofa<br />
You need to inject Skytrofa once a week, on the same day each week, at any time during the day.  </p>
<p>If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly injection. Skytrofa can be administered 2 days 
before or 2 days after the scheduled dosing day. There should be at least 5 days since your last 
injection, on the old day and the first dose on the new day. After selecting a new dosing day, continue 
giving yourself the injection on that day each week. Ask your doctor if you are not sure how to do this. </p>
<p>Preparation and administration 
Read  Instructions for use  at the end of this leaflet before you start using this medicine.  </p>
<p>Skytrofa comes in a two-chamber cartridge containing both medicine (powder) and a solvent (liquid). 
It is to be used with the needles supplied. To give injections, you also need a Skytrofa Auto-Injector. 
The Skytrofa Auto-Injector is supplied separately.  </p>
<p>The powder and solvent will be mixed together into a solution for injection by the Skytrofa 
Auto-Injector. After mixing, the solution is ready for use and the medicine can be injected under the 
skin using the Skytrofa Auto-Injector. </p>
<p>Read the instructions for use provided with the Skytrofa Auto-Injector. </p>
<p>If you or your child use more than you should 
If you have injected more Skytrofa than you should have, contact your doctor for advice. If you inject 
too much Skytrofa, your blood sugar level may fall too low and later rise too high. Long-term 
overdose could cause irregular growth. </p>
<p>If you or your child forget to use Skytrofa<br />
If you miss your weekly dose and you are 1 or 2 days late: inject today, then on your usual day next 
week. If you are 3 days late or more: skip the missed dose and then resume injections on your next 
usual dosing day. Leave at least 5 clear days between injections. </p>
<p>If you or your child stop using Skytrofa<br />
Do not stop using Skytrofa without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking Skytrofa prematurely, 
your growth rate may decline, and your final height may be less than if you had completed the full 
course of treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
