stomach acid. Hence it reduces the amount of acid in your stomach.  </p>
<p>SOMAC Control is used for the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (for example heartburn, acid 
regurgitation) in adults. </p>
<p>Reflux is the backflow of acid from the stomach into the gullet ( foodpipe ), which may become 
inflamed and painful. This may cause you symptoms such as a painful burning sensation in the chest 
rising up to the throat (heartburn) and a sour taste in the mouth (acid regurgitation). </p>
<p>You may experience relief from your acid reflux and heartburn symptoms after just one day of 
treatment with SOMAC Control, but this medicine is not meant to bring immediate relief. It may be 
necessary to take the tablets for 2-3 consecutive days to relieve the symptoms.  </p>
<p>You must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after 2 weeks. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to pantoprazole or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) </li>
<li>if you are taking HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, nelfinavir (for the treatment of 
HIV-infection). See  Other medicines and SOMAC Control . </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking SOMAC Control 
- if you have been treated for heartburn or indigestion continuously for 4 or more weeks 
- if you are over 55 years old and taking non-prescription indigestion treatment on a daily basis 
- if you are over 55 years old with any new or recently changed reflux symptoms 
- if you have previously had a gastric ulcer or stomach surgery 
- if you have liver problems or jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes) 
- if you regularly see your doctor for serious complaints or conditions<br />
- if you are due to have an endoscopy or a breath test called a C-urea test. 
- if you have ever had a skin reaction after treatment with a medicine similar to SOMAC Control 
that reduces stomach acid.<br />
- if you are due to have a specific blood test (Chromogranin A) 
- if you are taking HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, nelfinavir (for the treatment of 
HIV-infection) at the same time as pantoprazole, ask your doctor for specific advice. </p>
<p>Do not take this product for longer than 4 weeks without consulting your doctor. If your reflux 
symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) persist for longer than 2 weeks, consult your doctor who 
will decide about the need for long-term intake of this medicine. </p>
<p>If you take SOMAC Control for longer periods, this may cause additional risks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>reduced absorption of Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B12 deficiency if you already have low body 
stores of Vitamin B12. Please contact your doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms, 
which could indicate low levels of Vitamin B12:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extreme tiredness or lack of energy  </p>
</li>
<li>Pins and needles  </li>
<li>Sore or red tongue, mouth ulcers  </li>
<li>Muscle weakness </li>
<li>Disturbed vision  </li>
<li>Problems with memory, confusion, depression </li>
<li>fracture of your hip, wrist or spine, especially if you already have osteoporosis (reduced bone 
density) or if your doctor has told you that you are at risk of getting osteoporosis (for example, 
if you are taking steroids). </li>
<li>falling magnesium levels in your blood (potential symptoms: fatigue, involuntary muscle 
contractions, disorientation, convulsions, dizziness, increased heart rate). Low levels of 
magnesium can also lead to a reduction in potassium or calcium levels in the blood. You should 
talk to your doctor if you have been using this product for more than 4 weeks. Your doctor may 
decide to perform regular blood tests to monitor your levels of magnesium. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately, before or after taking this medicine, if you notice any of the following 
symptoms, which could be a sign of another, more serious, disease:</p>
<ul>
<li>an unintentional loss of weight (not related to a diet or an exercise programme) </li>
<li>vomiting, particularly if repeated </li>
<li>vomiting blood; this may appear as dark coffee grounds in your vomit </li>
<li>you notice blood in your stools; which may be black or tarry in appearance </li>
<li>difficulty in swallowing or pain when swallowing </li>
<li>you look pale and feel weak (anaemia) </li>
<li>chest pain </li>
<li>stomach pain </li>
<li>severe and/or persistent diarrhoea, because this medicine has been associated with a small 
increase in infectious diarrhoea. </li>
<li>if you get a rash on your skin, especially in areas exposed to the sun tell your doctor as soon as 
you can, as you may need to stop your treatment with SOMAC Control. Remember to also 
mention any other ill-effects like pain in your joints. </li>
<li>Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and erythema multiforme,  have 
been reported in association with pantoprazole treatment. Stop using pantoprazole and seek 
medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to these serious skin 
reactions described in section 4. Your doctor may decide that you need some tests.  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are due to have a blood test, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You may experience relief from your acid reflux and heartburn symptoms after just one day of 
treatment with SOMAC Control, but this medicine is not meant to bring immediate relief. 
You should not take it as a preventive measure. </p>
<p>If you have been suffering from repetitive heartburn or indigestion symptoms for some time, 
remember to see your doctor regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>SOMAC Control should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to a lack of 
safety information in this younger age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and SOMAC Control </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  </p>
<p>SOMAC Control may stop certain other medicines from working properly. Especially medicines 
containing one of the following active substances:</p>
<ul>
<li>HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, nelfinavir (for the treatment of HIV-infection). You 
must not use SOMAC Control if you are taking HIV protease inhibitors. See  Do not take 
SOMAC Control . </li>
<li>ketoconazole (used for fungal infections). </li>
<li>warfarin and phenprocoumon (used to thin blood and prevent clots). You may need further 
blood tests. </li>
<li>methotrexate (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer)   if you are taking 
methotrexate your doctor may temporarily stop your SOMAC Control treatment because 
pantoprazole can increase levels of methotrexate in the blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not take SOMAC Control with other medicines which limit the amount of acid produced in your 
stomach, such as another proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole, lansoprazole or rabeprazole) or an 
H2 antagonist (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine). 
However, you may take SOMAC Control with antacids (e.g. magaldrate, alginic acid, sodium 
bicarbonate, aluminium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, or combinations thereof), if needed. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking SOMAC Control if you are due to have a specific urine test (for 
THC; Tetrahydrocannabinol). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>You should not take this medicine if you are pregnant or while breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>If you experience side effects like dizziness or disturbed vision, you should not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>SOMAC Control contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
