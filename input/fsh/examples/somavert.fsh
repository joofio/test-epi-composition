or pharmacist if you are not sure.
A starting dose of 80 mg of pegvisomant will be given subcutaneously (just under the skin) by your 
doctor. Following this, the usual daily dose of pegvisomant is 10 mg, which is given by subcutaneous 
injection (just under the skin).
Every four to six weeks your doctor will make appropriate dose adjustments, made in increments of 
5 mg pegvisomant/day, based on your so-called serum IGF-I levels to maintain an optimal therapeutic 
response. 
Method and route of administration
SOMAVERT is injected under the skin. The injection can be self-administered or given by another 
person, for example your doctor or his/her assistant. The detailed instructions on injection procedure 
provided at the end of this leaflet must be followed. You should continue to inject this medicine for as 
long as instructed by your doctor.
This medicine must be dissolved before use. The injection must not be mixed in the same syringe or 
vial as any other medicine.
Fatty tissue of the skin can build-up at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place 
for your injection each time, as described in Step 2 of the  instructions for preparing and giving an 
injection of SOMAVERT  section of this leaflet. This gives your skin and the area under your skin 
time to recover from one injection before it receives another one in the same place.
If you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
If you inject more SOMAVERT than you should
If you accidentally inject more SOMAVERT than told to by your doctor it is unlikely to be serious, 
but you should contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately.
If you forget to use SOMAVERT
If you forget to give yourself an injection you should inject the next dose as soon as you remember 
and then continue to inject SOMAVERT as prescribed by your doctor. Do not inject a double dose to 
make up for forgotten individual doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

The carton(s) containing the SOMAVERT powder vial(s) may be stored at room temperature up to a 
maximum of 25 C for a single period of up to 30 days. Write the Use by date on the carton including 
day/month/year (up to 30 days from the date removed from the refrigerator). The vial(s) must be 
protected from light. Do not return this medicine to refrigerator.
Discard this medicine if not used by the new Use by date or the expiry date printed on the carton, 
whichever is earlier.
The pre-filled solvent syringe may be stored at room temperature. Keep out of reach of children.
1. Things you need
A single SOMAVERT pack containing:</p>
<p>A vial of SOMAVERT powder.</p>
<p>A pre-filled syringe with solvent.</p>
<p>A safety needle.
You will also need:</p>
<p>A cotton ball.</p>
<p>An alcohol swab.</p>
<p>A suitable sharps container.
2. Getting ready
Before you start:</p>
<p>Only mix SOMAVERT and the solvent when you are ready to inject your dose.</p>
<p>Remove a single SOMAVERT pack from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room 
temperature naturally in a safe place.</p>
<p>Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry thoroughly. </p>
<p>Peel open the packaging of the syringe and safety needle to make it easier to pick up each 
item as you prepare for your injection.</p>
<p>Do not use the syringe or vial if: * they are damaged or faulty; * the expiration date has passed; * it has been frozen, even if it has now thawed (syringe only).
3. Choose injection area</p>
<p>Choose a different location within an area for each injection. </p>
<p>Avoid bony areas or areas that are bruised, red, sore or hard, or areas that have scars or 
skin conditions. </p>
<p>Clean the injection area with the alcohol swab as instructed by your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Allow the injection area to dry.
4. Remove vial cap</p>
<p>Remove the cap from the vial.</p>
<p>Throw the cap away; it is not needed again.
Caution: Do not let anything touch the vial stopper.
5. Remove syringe cap</p>
<p>Snap off the syringe cap. It may take more effort to snap off than you might expect.</p>
<p>Throw the syringe cap away; it is not needed again.</p>
<p>Keep the syringe upright to avoid leakage.
Caution: Do not let the end of the syringe touch anything when the syringe cap is off.
6. Attach safety needle</p>
<p>Twist the safety needle firmly onto the syringe as far as it will go.
7. Remove needle cover</p>
<p>Fold the needle guard out of the way of the needle cover.</p>
<p>Carefully pull the needle cover straight off.</p>
<p>Throw the needle cover away; it is not needed again.
Caution: Do not let the needle touch anything.
8. Insert needle</p>
<p>Push the needle through the centre of vial stopper, as shown.</p>
<p>Support the syringe while the needle is in the vial stopper to prevent bending the needle.
9. Add liquid</p>
<p>Tilt both the vial and syringe at an angle, as shown.</p>
<p>Push the plunger rod down slowly until all the liquid has emptied into the vial.</p>
<p>Caution: Do not squirt the liquid directly onto the powder, as this creates foam. Foam 
makes the medicine unusable.</p>
<p>Do not withdraw the needle yet.
10. Swirl vial</p>
<p>Support both the syringe and vial in one hand, as shown.</p>
<p>Gently swirl the liquid, sliding the vial in a circular motion on a flat surface.</p>
<p>Continue swirling the liquid until all the powder has fully dissolved.
Note: This may take up to 5 minutes.
11. Check medicine</p>
<p>Keeping the needle in the vial, look carefully at the medicine. It must be clear and free of 
particles.</p>
<p>Do not use if:<em> the medicine is cloudy or hazy;</em> the medicine has any colour at all;* there are any particles or there is a layer of foam in the vial.
12. Reposition needle</p>
<p>Turn the vial so that you can see the stopper gap, as shown.</p>
<p>Pull the needle down so that the needle tip is at the lowest point in the liquid. This will 
help you to draw off as much liquid as possible.</p>
<p>Check that the plunger rod has not moved if it has, then push it back all the way into the 
syringe. This ensures that all air is removed from the syringe before you draw off the 
dose.
13. Draw off dose</p>
<p>Slowly pull back the plunger rod to withdraw as much medicine as possible from the vial.
Note: If you see air in the syringe, tap the barrel to float the bubbles to the top, and then 
gently push the bubbles out into the vial.</p>
<p>Pull the needle out of the vial.
14. Insert needle</p>
<p>Gently pinch the skin at the site of injection. </p>
<p>Insert the needle to its full depth into the pinched skin.
15. Inject medicine</p>
<p>Push the plunger rod down slowly until the barrel is empty.
Note: Make sure you keep the needle in at full depth.</p>
<p>Release the pinched skin and pull the needle straight out.
16. Make needle safe</p>
<p>Fold the needle guard over the needle.</p>
<p>Gently apply pressure using a hard surface to lock the needle guard in place.
Note: You will hear a click when the needle guard has been locked.
17. Dispose</p>
<p>The syringe and needle should NEVER be reused. Dispose of the needle and syringe as 
instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and in accordance with local health and 
safety laws.
18. After injection</p>
<p>If necessary, use a clean cotton ball and press lightly on the injection area.</p>
<p>Do not rub the area.
QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS
What should I do if anything has accidentally touched the vial stopper?</p>
<p>Clean the vial stopper with a fresh alcohol wipe, and leave it to dry completely. If you are 
unable to clean the stopper, do not use the vial.
What should I do with the syringe if it has been dropped?</p>
<p>Do not use it even if it looks undamaged. Dispose of the syringe in the same way as a 
used syringe. You will need a replacement syringe.
How many times can I safely insert the needle into the vial stopper?</p>
<p>Once only. Withdrawing and reinserting greatly increases the risk of needle damage, and 
will blunt the needle. This can cause discomfort and increases risk of skin damage and 
infection. There is also a risk you may lose some of the medicine.
Is it OK to shake the vial if the powder is not dissolving?</p>
<p>No never shake the vial. Shaking can destroy the medicine and create foam. The 
powder may take a few minutes to dissolve fully, so continue swirling the vial gently 
until the liquid is completely clear.
How can I tell if there is any foam in the vial?</p>
<p>Foam looks like a mass of small bubbles that float as a layer to the top of the liquid. Do 
not inject SOMAVERT if it has foamed.
How can I prevent the medicine from foaming?</p>
<p>Press the plunger very slowly so that the liquid gently runs down the inside of the vial. 
Do not spray the liquid directly onto the powder, as this creates foam. This technique will 
also reduce the swirling time and allow more of the medicine to be drawn off.
I can see some air in the syringe. Is this OK?</p>
<p>Tiny air bubbles in the liquid are normal and are safe to inject. However, it is possible to 
accidently draw air into the syringe, which should be removed before injecting. Bubbles 
or air gaps that float to the top of the liquid should be pushed back out into the vial.
Why can t I get all of the medicine out of the vial?</p>
<p>The shape of the vial means that a very small amount of the medicine will be left behind 
in the vial. This is normal. To ensure that only a trace of medicine remains, make sure the 
needle tip is as low as it can be in the vial when drawing off your dose.
What should I do if I have any doubts about my medicine?</p>
<p>All questions should be handled by a doctor, nurse or pharmacist familiar with 
SOMAVERT.</p>         </div>"""
