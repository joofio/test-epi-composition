- If you are allergic to sorafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sorafenib Accord. </p>
<p>Take special care with Sorafenib Accord 
- If you experience skin problems. Sorafenib Accord can cause rashes and skin reactions, 
especially on the hands and feet. These can usually be treated by your doctor. If not, your doctor 
may interrupt treatment or stop it altogether. 
- If you have high blood pressure. Sorafenib Accord can raise blood pressure, and your doctor 
will usually monitor your blood pressure and may give you a medicine to treat your high blood 
pressure. 
- If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or 
a tear in a blood vessel wall.<br />
- If you have diabetes. Blood sugar levels in diabetic patients should be checked regularly in 
order to assess if anti-diabetic medicine s dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of 
low blood sugar. 
- If you get any bleeding problems, or are taking warfarin or phenprocoumon. Treatment 
with Sorafenib Accord may lead to a higher risk of bleeding. If you are taking warfarin or 
phenprocoumon, medicines which thin the blood to prevent blood clots, there may be a greater 
risk of bleeding. 
- If you get chest pain or heart problems. Your doctor may decide to interrupt treatment or stop 
it altogether. 
- If you have a heart disorder, such as an abnormal electrical signal called "prolongation of the 
QT interval". 
- If you are going to have surgery, or if you had an operation recently. Sorafenib Accord 
might affect the way your wounds heal. You will usually be taken off Sorafenib Accord if you 
are having an operation. Your doctor will decide when to start with Sorafenib Accord again. 
- If you are taking irinotecan or are given docetaxel, which are also medicines for cancer. 
Sorafenib Accord may increase the effects and, in particular, the side effects of these medicines. 
- If you are taking Neomycin or other antibiotics. The effect of Sorafenib Accord may be 
decreased. 
- If you have severe liver impairment. You may experience more severe side effects when 
taking this medicine. 
- If you have poor kidney function. Your doctor will monitor your fluid and electrolyte balance. 
- Fertility. Sorafenib Accord may reduce fertility in both men and women. If you are concerned, 
talk to a doctor. 
- Holes in the gut wall (gastrointestinal perforation) may occur during treatment (see section 4: 
Possible Side Effects). In this case your doctor will interrupt the treatment. 
- If you have thyroid cancer. Your doctor will monitor blood calcium and thyroid hormone 
levels. 
- If you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately as this can be 
a life-threatening condition: nausea, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, muscular cramps, 
seizure, clouding of urine and tiredness. These may be caused by a group of metabolic 
complications that can occur during treatment of cancer that are caused by the break-down 
products of dying cancer cells (tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)) and can lead to changes in kidney 
function and acute renal failure (see also section 4: Possible side effects). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these affect you. You may need treatment for them, or your doctor may 
decide to change your dose of Sorafenib Accord, or stop treatment altogether (see also section 4: 
Possible side effects). </p>

<p>Swallow Sorafenib Accord tablets with a glass of water, either without food or with a low-fat or 
moderate fat meal. Do not take this medicine with high fat meals, as this may make Sorafenib Accord

after the meal. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you to. Check with your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>

suffering unacceptable side effects. </p>
<p>If you take more Sorafenib Accord than you should 
Tell your doctor straight away if you (or anyone else) have taken more than your prescribed dose. 
Taking too much Sorafenib Accord makes side effects more likely or more severe, especially 
diarrhoea and skin reactions. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Sorafenib Accord 
If you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is nearly time for the next dose, forget
