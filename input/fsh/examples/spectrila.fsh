level in blood cancer cells and stops the cancer growing. </p>

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Spectrila must not be used 
* if you are allergic to asparaginase or to the other ingredient of this medicine (listed in section 6),<br />
<em> if you have or previously had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), 
* if you have severe liver function problems,<br />
</em> if you have a blood clotting disorder (such as haemophilia), 
* if you had severe bleeding (haemorrhage) or severe blood clotting (thrombosis) under previous 
asparaginase treatment. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Spectrila. </p>
<p>The following life-threatening situations could arise during treatment with Spectrila: 
* severe inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis), 
* liver problems, 
* a serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty in breathing or dizziness, 
* blood clotting disorders (bleeding or formation of blood clots),<br />
* high blood sugar levels. </p>
<p>Before and during treatment with Spectrila your doctor will carry out blood tests. </p>
<p>If severe liver problems occur, treatment with Spectrila must be interrupted immediately. </p>
<p>If allergic symptoms occur, intravenous infusion of Spectrila must be discontinued immediately. You 
may be given anti-allergic medicines and, if necessary, medicines to stabilise your circulation. In the 
majority of cases, your treatment can be continued by switching to other medicines containing 
different forms of asparaginase. </p>
<p>Blood clotting disorders may require you to receive fresh plasma or a certain type of protein 
(antithrombin III) in order to reduce the risk of bleeding or formation of blood clots (thrombosis). </p>
<p>High blood sugar levels may require treatment with intravenous fluids and/or insulin. </p>
<p>Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (characterised by headache, confusion, seizures 
and visual loss) may require blood-pressure lowering medicines and in case of seizure, anti-epileptic 
treatment. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Spectrila 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. This is 
important as Spectrila may increase the side effects of other medicines through its effect on the liver 
which plays an important role in removing medicines from the body. </p>
<p>In addition, it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are also using any of the following 
medicines: 
* Vincristine (used to treat certain types of cancer) since the simultaneous use of vincristine and 
asparaginase may increase the risk of certain side effects. To avoid this, vincristine is usually 
given 3 24 hours before asparaginase. 
* Glucocorticoids (anti-inflammation medicines that dampen down your immune system) since 
the simultaneous use of glucocorticoids and asparaginase may increase the formation of blood 
clots (thrombosis). 
* Medicines that reduce the ability of blood to clot, such as anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin and 
heparin), dipyridamole, acetylsalicylic acid or medicines to treat pain and inflammation, since 
using these medicines with asparaginase may increase the risk of bleeding. 
* Medicines which are metabolised in the liver (e.g. paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, 
tetracycline) because the risk of side effects may increase. 
* Asparaginase may influence the efficacy of methotrexate or cytarabine (used to treat certain 
types of cancer):</p>
<ul>
<li>if asparaginase is given after these medicines their effect may be increased.  </li>
<li>if asparaginase is given before these medicines their effect may be weakened.  </li>
<li>Medicines which may have a negative effect on liver function (e.g. paracetamol, acetylsalicylic 
acid, tetracycline) since these negative effects may be worsened by parallel treatment with 
asparaginase. </li>
<li>Medicines which may suppress bone marrow function (e.g. cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
methotrexate) as these effects may be enhanced by parallel use of asparaginase. You may be 
more prone to infections.  </li>
<li>Other anti-cancer medicines as they may contribute to the release of too much uric acid when 
tumour cells are destroyed by asparaginase. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccination 
Simultaneous vaccination with live vaccines may increase the risk of a serious infection. You should 
therefore not receive vaccination with live vaccines until at least 3 months after the end of treatment 
with Spectrila. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
There are no data on the use of asparaginase in pregnant women. Spectrila should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with asparaginase. 
It is unknown whether asparaginase is present in human breast milk. Therefore, Spectrila must not be 
used during breast-feeding.<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are a woman you must use contraceptives or remain abstinent during chemotherapy and for 7 
months after the end of treatment. Since an indirect interaction between components of the oral 
contraception and asparaginase cannot be ruled out, oral contraceptives are not considered sufficiently 
safe. A method other than oral contraceptives should be used in women of childbearing potential. </p>
<p>If you are a man, you should take adequate precautions to ensure that your partner does not become 
pregnant during your treatment with Spectrila and for 4 months after the last dose. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines when taking this medicine because it may make you feel drowsy, tired 
or confused. </p>         </div>"""

necessary, your doctor will treat your symptoms and will give you supportive care. </p>
