Spevigo contains the active substance spesolimab. Spesolimab belongs to a group of medicines called 
interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL36R, 
which is involved in inflammation.
What Spevigo is used for
Spevigo is used alone in adults to treat flares of a rare inflammatory skin disease called generalised 
pustular psoriasis (GPP). During a flare, patients may experience painful skin blisters that develop 
suddenly over large areas of the skin. These blisters, also called pustules, are filled with pus. The skin 
may become red, itchy, dry, cracked or scaly. Patients may also experience more general signs and 
symptoms, such as fever, headache, extreme tiredness, or a burning sensation of the skin.
Spevigo improves skin clearance and reduces symptoms of GPP during a flare.</p>         </div>"""

You must not receive Spevigo if you:</p>
<p>are allergic to spesolimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</p>
<p>have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see  Warnings and precautions ).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Spevigo if you:</p>
<p>currently have an infection or have an infection that keeps coming back. Fever, flu-like 
symptoms, tiredness or shortness of breath, a cough which will not go away, warm, red and 
painful skin, or a painful rash with blisters can be signs and symptoms of an infection.</p>
<p>have, have had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone with tuberculosis.</p>
<p>have recently had a vaccination or plan to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain 
types of vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after being given Spevigo.</p>
<p>experience symptoms like weakness in your arms or legs that was not there before or numbness 
(loss of sensation), tingling or a burning sensation in any part of your body. These might be 
signs of peripheral neuropathy (damage of the peripheral nerves).
Infections
Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any signs or symptoms of an infection after you have 
been given Spevigo, see section 4  Possible side effects .
Allergic reactions
Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction while or 
after you are given this medicine. You can also have allergic reactions some days or weeks after 
receiving Spevigo. For signs and symptoms see section 4  Possible side effects .
Children and adolescents
Spevigo is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not
been studied in this age group.
Other medicines and Spevigo
Tell your doctor if you are:</p>
<p>taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including any other medicines to 
treat GPP.</p>
<p>going to have or have recently had a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of 
vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after receiving Spevigo.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Pregnancy
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before being given this medicine. This is because it is not known how this medicine will affect 
the baby.
It is therefore preferable to avoid the use of Spevigo during pregnancy.
If you are pregnant, you should only receive this medicine if your doctor has clearly recommended it.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether Spevigo passes into breast milk. Spevigo may pass into breast milk in the first 
days after birth. You should therefore tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, 
so you and your doctor can decide if you can be given Spevigo.
Driving and using machines
Spevigo is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Spevigo contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free .</p>         </div>"""

one week after the first.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

Tel: +353 1 295 9This leaflet was last revised in
This medicine has been given  conditional approval . This means that there is more evidence to come 
about this medicine.
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicine at least every year and 
this leaflet will be updated as necessary.
Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose is a single dose of 900 mg (2 vials of 450 mg) administered as an intravenous 
infusion. Spevigo must be diluted before use. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or 
bolus.
If flare symptoms persist, an additional 900 mg dose may be administered 1 week after the initial dose.
Following dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, Spevigo is 
administered as a continuous intravenous infusion through an intravenous line containing a sterile, 
non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2 micron) over 90 minutes. No other 
infusion should be administered in parallel via the same intravenous access.
In the event that the infusion is slowed or temporarily stopped, the total infusion time (including stop 
time) should not exceed 180 minutes.
Handling instructions</p>
<p>The vial should be visually inspected before use.
- Spevigo is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution.
- If the solution is cloudy, discoloured, or contains large or coloured particulates, the vial should 
be discarded.</p>
<p>Spesolimab sterile concentrate is for single use only.</p>
<p>Aseptic technique must be used to prepare the solution for infusion. Draw and discard 15 mL
from a 100 mL container of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and replace 
slowly with 15 mL spesolimab sterile concentrate (complete content from two vials of 
450 mg/7.5 mL). Mix gently before use. The diluted spesolimab infusion solution should be 
used immediately.</p>
<p>Spevigo must not be mixed with other medicinal products. A pre-existing intravenous line may 
be used for administration of the diluted spesolimab infusion solution. The line must be flushed 
with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection prior to and at the end of infusion. 
No other infusion should be administered in parallel via the same intravenous access.</p>
<p>Spevigo is compatible with infusion sets composed of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene 
(PE), polypropylene (PP), polybutadiene and polyurethane (PUR), and in-line filter membranes 
composed of polyethersulfone (PES, neutral and positively charged) and positively charged 
polyamide (PA).
Storage conditions
Unopened vial</p>
<p>Store in a refrigerator (2  C   8  C). Do not freeze.</p>
<p>Store in the original package in order to protect from light.</p>
<p>Prior to use, the unopened vial may be kept at temperatures up to 30  C for up to 24 hours, if 
stored in the original package in order to protect from light.
After opening</p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, once opened, the medicinal product should be diluted and 
infused immediately.
After preparation of infusion</p>
<p>Chemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution has been demonstrated for 
24 hours at 2  C   30  C.</p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in use storage conditions are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2  C   8  C, unless dilution has taken place 
in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. For the time between preparation and start of 
administration the solution for infusion should be protected from light following local standard 
procedures.
