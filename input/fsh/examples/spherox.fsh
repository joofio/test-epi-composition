  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Spherox is a medicine used to repair damage to the cartilage of the knee in adults and in 
adolescents whose bones in the joint have finished growing. Cartilage is a hard smooth layer inside 
your joints, on the ends of the bones. It protects the bones and allows joints to work smoothly. 
Spherox is used in adults, or adolescents whose bones have finished growing, when the cartilage in the 
knee joint is damaged, for example by acute injury, such as a fall or long-term wear due to incorrect 
weight bearing on the joint. Spherox is used to treat defects up to 10 cm  in size. </p>
<p>Spherox consists of so-called spheroids. A spheroid looks like a tiny pearl made of cartilage cells and 
cartilage material derived from your own body. To make the spheroids, a small cartilage sample is 
taken from one of your joints during a minor operation, and then grown in the laboratory to make the 
medicine. The spheroids are implanted by surgery to the damaged cartilage area and stick to the 
damaged part. They are then expected to repair the damage with healthy and functional cartilage over 
time. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>the bones in the knee joint have not finished growing </li>
<li>you have advanced joint and bone inflammation with damage in the affected joint 
(osteoarthritis) </li>
<li>you are infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you are given Spherox, if you have any other joint problems or excess 
weight, as this may reduce the success of the procedure. </p>
<p>Spherox should preferably be implanted into an otherwise healthy joint. Other joint problems should 
be corrected before or at the time of Spherox implantation. </p>
<p>After the treatment, bleeding into the knee joint and possibly into the surrounding area may happen, 
mainly if you have an increased tendency of bleeding or if bleeding during the treatment could not be 
fully stopped. The physician will check in advance the risk that you may face a bleeding after the 
treatment. In that case, you will get medicine to decrease the risk of bleeding after the treatment. </p>
<p>Rehabilitation program </p>
<p>Follow the rehabilitation program strictly after implantation. Only resume physical activity when 
instructed by your doctor. Resuming vigorous activity too soon may reduce the benefit and durability 
of Spherox. </p>
<p>Other cases in which Spherox cannot be supplied </p>
<p>Even if the cartilage sample has already been taken, it may happen that you cannot be treated with 
Spherox. This can occur because the sample taken is not of sufficient quality to manufacture the 
product. Your doctor might have to select an alternative treatment for you. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Spherox shall not be used in children or adolescents whose bones in the knee joint have not finished 
growing. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Spherox </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>Spherox is not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women, as it is applied during surgery. If 
you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>The surgical procedure to implant this medicine will have a major influence on your ability to drive 
and use machines. Driving cars and using machines may be limited during the rehabilitation period. 
Strictly follow the advice of your doctor or physical therapist. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Spherox can only be implanted by a specialist doctor in a medical facility and must only be used in the 
patient for whom it has been prepared. </p>
<p>Treatment with Spherox is a two-step procedure: </p>
<p>Visit 1: 
Evaluation of the damage to the cartilage, sample and blood taking </p>
<p>On the first visit, the doctor will examine the damage to your knee cartilage during an exploratory 
operation. This is usually done as keyhole surgery through very small incisions (cuts), using a special 
instrument to look inside the knee (arthroscopy). 
If Spherox is appropriate for you, the doctor will take a small cartilage sample from your joint. Most 
likely this will be from the same knee joint that has to be treated. Your cartilage cells are extracted 
from this sample in a laboratory and are then grown to make the spheroids that constitute Spherox. 
The process takes about 6 to 8 weeks. </p>
<p>Visit 2: 
Spherox implantation </p>
<p>Spherox is implanted into the damaged area of cartilage in the knee during a second operation. This 
may also be carried out by keyhole surgery.  </p>
<p>Rehabilitation </p>
<p>In order to allow your knee joint to recover well, you will have to follow an individual rehabilitation 
program. This may take up to one year. Your doctor or physical therapist will advise you. </p>
<p>Very important: Carefully follow the recommendations of your doctor and physical therapist. The 
risk of treatment failure may increase if you do not follow your rehabilitation schedule. 
Be very careful when bending and putting weight on your treated joint. During the rehabilitation 
period, the amount of weight you can put on the joint will increase gradually. How quickly this occurs 
depends for example on your body weight and the extent of the damage to the cartilage. Depending on 
the condition of the treated knee joint, you may have to wear a brace. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or physical therapist if you have any further questions about treatment with Spherox. </p>         </div>"""
