Spravato contains the active substance esketamine. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
anti-depressants and you have been given this medicine to treat your depression.
What Spravato is used for
Spravato is used in adults to reduce the symptoms of depression, such as, feeling sad, anxious, or 
worthless, sleeping difficulties, change in appetite, loss of interest in favourite activities, feeling of 
being slowed down. It is given, together with another antidepressant, if you have tried at least 2 other 
antidepressant medicines but they have not helped.
Spravato is also used in adults to rapidly reduce symptoms of depression in a situation requiring 
immediate treatment (also known as a psychiatric emergency).</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to esketamine, a similar medicine called ketamine used for anaesthesia, or any 
of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</p>
<h2>if you have ever had certain conditions such as:</h2>
<h2>an aneurysm (a weak spot in a blood vessel wall where it widens or bulges out)</h2>
<p>bleeding in the brain</p>
<p>if you recently had a heart attack (within 6 weeks)
This is because Spravato can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure that may lead to 
serious complications in these conditions.
Do not use Spravato if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using Spravato - your doctor will decide whether or not you can use this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using Spravato if you have:</p>
<p>a heart problem which is not well controlled such as: poor blood flow in the blood vessels of the 
heart frequently with chest pain (such as angina), high blood pressure, heart valve disease or 
heart failure</p>
<p>ever had problems with the blood supply to your brain (such as a stroke)</p>
<p>ever had problems with drug abuse   prescribed medicines or illegal drugs</p>
<p>ever had a condition called psychosis - where you believe in things that are not true (delusions) 
or see, feel, or hear things that are not there (hallucinations)</p>

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before using Spravato. Your 
doctor will decide whether you should use this medicine.
Depression getting worse
Tell your doctor or go to the nearest hospital straight away if you have thoughts of harming or killing 
yourself at any time. 
You may find it helpful to talk to a relative or a close friend if you are depressed and ask them if they 
think your depression is getting worse or if they are worried about your behaviour. You might ask 
them to read this leaflet.
Blood pressure
Spravato can increase your blood pressure for about 1 to 2 hours after you use it so your blood 
pressure will be measured before you start using Spravato and after using it.
If your blood pressure is high before using this medicine, your doctor will decide whether to start the 
medicine or wait until your blood pressure is lower. If your blood pressure goes up after using this 
medicine and stays high for more than a few hours, you may need to have some more tests.
This medicine may cause a temporary increase in your blood pressure after taking a dose. Your blood 
pressure will be checked before and after using this medicine. Tell the medical staff right away if you 
get chest pain, shortness of breath, sudden severe headache, change in vision, or seizures (fits) after 
using this medicine.
Tell your doctor if you get any of the below while you are using Spravato</p>
<p>difficulty with your attention, judgment and thinking (see also  Driving and using machines<br />
and  Possible side effects ). During and after each use of this medicine, your doctor will check 
your condition and decide how long to monitor you.</p>
<p>sleepiness (sedation), fainting, dizziness, spinning sensation, anxiety, or feeling disconnected 
from yourself, your thoughts, feelings, space and time (dissociation), difficulties in breathing 
(respiratory depression). Tell the medical staff right away if your feel like you cannot stay 
awake or if you feel like you are going to pass out.</p>
<p>pain when urinating or seeing blood in your urine   these could be signs of bladder problems. 
These can occur with high doses of a similar medicine (called ketamine) used over a long 
period.
Tell your doctor if you get any of the above while you are taking Spravato.
Elderly (&gt;65 years)
If you are elderly (&gt;65 years), you will be carefully monitored as you may be at increased risk of 
falling when you start moving around after treatment.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age. This is because 
Spravato has not been studied for treatment-resistant depression in this age group.
Other medicines and Spravato
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Using Spravato with certain medicines may cause side effects. Especially tell your doctor if you take:</p>
<p>Medicines used to treat nervous disorders or severe pain (for example, benzodiazepines,
opioids), or medicines or beverages containing alcohol</p>
<p>Stimulants such as those used for conditions such as narcolepsy or medicines for ADHD (for 
example, amphetamines, methylphenidate, modafinil, armodafinil)</p>
<p>Medicines that can increase your blood pressure, such as, thyroid hormones, asthma 
medications such as xanthine derivatives, medications for child birth bleeding (ergometrine) and 
heart medication such as vasopressin.</p>
<p>Medicines for depression or Parkinson s disease known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs) (for example, tranylcypromine, selegiline, phenelzine).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Contraception

doctor about suitable methods of contraception.

If you become pregnant while being treated with Spravato, talk to your doctor straight away   to 
decide whether to stop treatment and to learn about other options for treatment.
Breast-feeding
Do not use Spravato if you are breast-feeding. Talk to your doctor before using Spravato if you are 
breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss with you whether to stop breast-feeding or stop using this 
medicine. Your doctor will take into account the benefit of breast-feeding for you and your child, and 
the benefit of treatment for you.
Driving and using machines
Spravato can make you feel sleepy, dizzy, and have other side effects that can temporarily affect your 
ability to drive vehicles or use machines and do activities that need you to be completely alert. After 
being treated with this medicine, do not take part in these activities until the next day following a 
restful sleep.</p>         </div>"""
