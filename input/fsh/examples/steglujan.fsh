  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Steglujan is
Steglujan contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and sitagliptin. Each belongs to a group of
medicines called  oral anti-diabetics . These are medicines taken by mouth to treat diabetes.
* Ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
* Sitagliptin belongs to a group of medicines called DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors.
What Steglujan is used for
* Steglujan lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2
diabetes. 
* Steglujan can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as separate tablets. 
* Steglujan can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. 
* You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Steglujan.
How Steglujan works
* Ertugliflozin works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar to
be removed in your urine.
* Sitagliptin helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal. It also lowers the
amount of sugar made by your body.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that
your body produces does not work as well as it should. This leads to a high level of sugar in your
blood. When this happens, this can lead to serious medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease,
blindness and poor circulation.</p>         </div>"""

(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before and while taking Steglujan if you:
* have kidney problems. Your doctor may do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are
working.
* have or have had urinary tract infections
* have or have had yeast infections of the vagina or penis.
* have or have had a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis).
* have or have had gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of
fat) in your blood. These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis
(see section 4).
* have type 1 diabetes. Steglujan should not be used to treat this condition as it may increase the
risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients.
* take other diabetes medicines: you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain
medicines.
* might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine
production [diuretics] or lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). Ask about ways
to prevent dehydration.
* experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and
deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet
or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat contact a doctor or the
nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic ketoacidosis    a
problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your urine
or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with
prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin
dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid.
Your doctor may ask you to stop Steglujan.
It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by
your healthcare professional. 
Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving
sitagliptin (see section 4).
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness,
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
When this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from
the pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your
insulin or other medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Urine glucose
Because of how Steglujan works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on this
medicine.
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not take this medicine. It is not known if this
medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Steglujan
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor:
* if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics). 
* if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood, such as insulin
or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas.
* if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heartbeat and other heart problems).
The level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if you are taking it with Steglujan.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is not known if Steglujan can harm your unborn baby. You should not take this medicine during
pregnancy.
It is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to
feed your baby if you take Steglujan. You should not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding or
plan to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However,
dizziness and drowsiness have been reported with sitagliptin, which may affect your ability to drive or
use machines. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Steglujan.
Taking this medicine in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the
pancreas can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms
such as shaking, sweating or changes in vision and may affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Steglujan contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

How much to take
* The recommended dose of Steglujan is one tablet once a day.
* The dose of Steglujan that you take will depend on your condition and the amount of
ertugliflozin and sitagliptin needed to control your blood sugar.
* Your doctor will prescribe the right dose for you. Do not change your dose unless your doctor
has told you to.
Taking this medicine
* Swallow the tablet; if you have difficulties with swallowing the tablet can be broken or crushed.
* Take one tablet every morning. Try to take it at the same time; this will help you remember to
take it.
* You can take your tablet with or without food.
* You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Steglujan.
If you take more Steglujan than you should
If you take too much Steglujan, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away.
If you forget to take Steglujan
What to do if you forget to take a tablet depends on how long it is until your next dose.
* If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose, take a dose of Steglujan as soon as you remember.
Then take your next dose at the usual time.
* If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at
the usual time.
Do not take a double dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Steglujan
Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor. Your blood sugar levels may increase
if you stop the medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
