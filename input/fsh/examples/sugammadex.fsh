  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Sugammadex Amomed is 
Sugammadex Amomed contains the active substance sugammadex. Sugammadex Amomed is 
considered to be a selective relaxant binding agent since it only works with specific muscle relaxants, 
rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide. </p>
<p>What Sugammadex Amomed is used for 
When you have some types of operations, your muscles must be completely relaxed. This makes it easier 
for the surgeon to do the operation. For this, the general anaesthetic you are given includes medicines to 
make your muscles relax. These are called muscle relaxants, and examples include rocuronium bromide 
and vecuronium bromide. Because these medicines also make your breathing muscles relax, you need 
help to breathe (artificial ventilation) during and after your operation until you can breathe on your own 
again. 
Sugammadex Amomed is used to speed up the recovery of your muscles after an operation to allow you 
to breathe on your own again earlier. It does this by combining with the rocuronium bromide or 
vecuronium bromide in your body. It can be used in adults whenever rocuronium bromide or 
vecuronium bromide is used and in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17 years) when rocuronium 
bromide is used for a moderate level of relaxation. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to sugammadex or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
 Tell your anaesthetist if this applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your anaesthetist before Sugammadex Amomed is given 
* if you have kidney disease or had in the past. This is important as Sugammadex Amomed is 
removed from your body by the kidneys. 
* if you have liver disease or have had it in the past. 
* if you have fluid retention (oedema). </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have diseases which are known to give an increased risk of bleeding (disturbances of blood 
clotting) or anticoagulation medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for infants less than 2 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sugammadex Amomed 
  Tell your anaesthetist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Sugammadex Amomed may affect other medicines or be affected by them. </p>
<p>Some medicines reduce the effect of Sugammadex Amomed 
  It is especially important that you tell your anaesthetist if you have recently taken: 
* toremifene (used to treat breast cancer). 
* fusidic acid (an antibiotic). </p>
<p>Sugammadex Amomed can affect hormonal contraceptives 
* Sugammadex Amomed can make hormonal contraceptives - including the  Pill , vaginal ring, 
implants or a hormonal IntraUterine System (IUS) - less effective because it reduces how much you 
get of the progestogen hormone. The amount of progestogen lost by using Sugammadex Amomed is 
about the same as missing one oral contraceptive Pill. 
  If you are taking the Pill on the same day as Sugammadex Amomed is given to you, follow the 
instructions for a missed dose in the Pill s package leaflet. 
  If you are using other hormonal contraceptives (for example a vaginal ring, implant or IUS) 
you should use an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method (such as a condom) for the next 
7 days and follow the advice in the package leaflet. </p>
<p>Effects on blood tests 
In general, Sugammadex Amomed does not have an effect on laboratory tests. However, it may affect 
the results of a blood test for a hormone called progesterone. Talk to your doctor if your progesterone 
levels need to be tested on the same day you receive Sugammadex Amomed. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
  Tell your anaesthetist if you are pregnant or might be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding. You may 
still be given Sugammadex Amomed, but you need to discuss it first. 
It is not known whether sugammadex can pass into breast milk. Your anaesthetist will help you decide 
whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to abstain from sugammadex therapy, considering the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Sugammadex Amomed to the mother. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Sugammadex Amomed has no known influence on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Sugammadex Amomed contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 9.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each ml. 
This is equivalent to 0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The dose 
Your anaesthetist will work out the dose of Sugammadex Amomed you need based on: 
* your weight 
* how much the muscle relaxant medicine is still affecting you. 
The usual dose is 2-4 mg per kg body weight for adults and for children and adolescents between 2-years old. A dose of 16 mg/kg can be used in adults if urgent recovery from muscle relaxation is needed. 
How Sugammadex Amomed is given 
Sugammadex Amomed will be given to you by your anaesthetist. It is given as a single injection through 
an intravenous line. </p>
<p>If more Sugammadex Amomed is given to you than recommended 
As your anaesthetist will be monitoring your condition carefully, it is unlikely that you will be given too 
much Sugammadex Amomed. But even if this happens, it is unlikely to cause any problems. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your anaesthetist or other doctor. </p>         </div>"""

decrease of blood pressure. Severe allergic or allergic-like reactions can be life threatening. 
Allergic reactions were reported more commonly in healthy, conscious volunteers 
* Return of muscle relaxation after the operation </p>
<p>Frequency not known 
* Severe slowing of the heart and slowing of the heart up to cardiac arrest may occur when 
Sugammadex Amomed is administered </p>
