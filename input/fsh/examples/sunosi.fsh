Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sunosi if you have or have had: </p>
<ul>
<li>mental health problems, including psychosis (altered sense of what is real) and extreme changes 
in mood (bipolar disorder) </li>
<li>heart problems, heart attack or stroke </li>
<li>high blood pressure </li>
<li>alcoholism or any drug abuse or dependence </li>
<li>an eye condition called angle closure glaucoma. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the above applies to you before starting treatment. This is 
because Sunosi may make some of these problems worse. Your doctor will want to monitor how the 
medicine affects you. </p>
<p>Sunosi does not replace your OSA primary treatment such as CPAP. You should continue to use such 
treatment as well as Sunosi. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Sunosi is not recommended in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. The safety and efficacy 
are not yet known in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sunosi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not take Sunosi if: 
* you are taking a medicine called a  monoamine oxidase inhibitor  (MAOI) for depression or 
Parkinson s disease, or have taken an MAOI in the last 14 days because taking an MAOI with 
Sunosi may increase your blood pressure. </p>
<p>Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines that can increase your blood 
pressure or heart rate, or if you are taking dopaminergic agents (e.g. pramipexole, levodopa, 
methylphenidate) which are used to treat Parkinson s disease, depression, restless leg syndrome and 
ADHD.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Sunosi should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using effective 
contraception. </p>
<p>You should not use Sunosi during breast-feeding. You and your doctor must decide whether to avoid 
breast-feeding or to stop or avoid Sunosi therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding 
for you and your child and the benefit of therapy for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may feel dizzy or your ability to concentrate may be impaired; take special care when driving or 
using machines.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure how your underlying condition or this medicine 
affects you with activities that require attention, such as driving and handling machinery:
