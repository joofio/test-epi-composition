Synjardy contains two active substances empagliflozin and metformin. Each belongs to a group of 
medicines called  oral anti-diabetics . These are medicines taken by mouth to treat type 2 diabetes. 
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. If you have type 2 
diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, 
and your body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. This results in high levels of glucose in your 
blood which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor 
circulation in your limbs.
How Synjardy works
Empagliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors. It works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar (glucose) 
to be removed in your urine. Metformin works in a different way to lower blood sugar levels, mainly 
by blocking glucose production in the liver. 
Thereby Synjardy lowers the amount of sugar in your blood. This medicine can also help prevent heart 
disease. 
What Synjardy is used for</p>
<p>Synjardy is added to diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes in adult patients (aged 18 years 
and older) whose diabetes cannot be controlled by adding metformin alone or metformin with 
other medicines for diabetes.</p>
<p>Synjardy can also be combined with other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. These may 
be medicines taken by mouth or given by injection such as insulin.</p>
<p>In addition, Synjardy can be used as an alternative to taking both empagliflozin and metformin 
as single tablets. To avoid overdose, do not continue taking empagliflozin and metformin tablets
separately, if you are taking this medicine.
It is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as told by your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to empagliflozin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6);</p>
<p>if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see  Risk of lactic 
acidosis  below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called  ketone 
bodies  accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell;</p>
<p>if you have had a diabetic pre-coma;</p>
<p>if you have serious kidney problems. Your doctor may limit your daily dose or ask you to take a 
different medicine (see also section 3,  How to take Synjardy ).</p>
<p>if you have a severe infection such as an infection affecting your lung or bronchial system or 
your kidney. Severe infections may lead to kidney problems, which can put you at risk for lactic 
acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions');</p>
<p>if you have lost a lot of water from your body (dehydration), e.g. due to long-lasting or severe 
diarrhoea, or if you have vomited several times in a row. Dehydration may lead to kidney 
problems, which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see 'Warnings and precautions');</p>
<p>if you are treated for acute heart failure or have recently had a heart attack, have severe 
problems with your circulation (such as shock) or have breathing difficulties. This may lead to a 
lack in oxygen supply to tissue which can put you at risk for lactic acidosis (see section 
 Warnings and precautions');</p>
<p>if you have problems with your liver;</p>
<p>if you drink large amounts of alcohol, either every day or only from time to time (see section 
 Synjardy with alcohol ).
Warnings and precautions
Risk of lactic acidosis
Synjardy may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your 
kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further 
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a 
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart diseases).
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Synjardy for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Synjardy and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience 
some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:</p>
<p>vomiting</p>
<p>stomach ache (abdominal pain)</p>
<p>muscle cramps</p>
<p>a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness</p>
<p>difficulty in breathing</p>
<p>reduced body temperature and heartbeat
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine, and during treatment:</p>
<p>if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a 
doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic 
ketoacidosis    a rare, but serious, sometines life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes 
because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of 
developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol 
consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to 
major surgery or serious illness;</p>
<p>if you have  type 1 diabetes    this type usually starts when you are young and your body does 
not produce any insulin. You should not take Synjardy if you have type 1 diabetes;</p>
<p>might be at risk of dehydration, for example:<em> if you are being sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink</em> if you are taking medicines that increase urine production [diuretics] or lower blood 
pressure* if you are 75 years old or older.
Possible signs are listed in section 4 under  dehydration . Your doctor may ask you to stop taking 
Synjardy until you recover to prevent loss of too much body fluid. Ask about ways to prevent 
dehydration. </p>
<p>if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask 
you to stop taking Synjardy until you have recovered;</p>
<p>if you need to undergo an examination with iodination contrast agents (such as X-ray or scan). 
More information is given below in  Other medicines and Synjardy .
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling 
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening 
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue 
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Surgery
If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Synjardy during and for some time after the 
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Synjardy.
Kidney function
During treatment with Synjardy, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or 
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Foot care
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional.
Urine glucose
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are taking this 
medicine.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years, because it has 
not been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Synjardy
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Synjardy before or at the time of the 
injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Synjardy.
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may 
need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the 
dosage of Synjardy. It is especially important to mention the following:</p>
<p>medicines which increase urine production (diuretics), as Synjardy may increase the risk of 
losing too much fluid. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Synjardy. Possible signs of 
losing too much fluid from your body are listed in section 4.<br />
other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or a 
 sulphonylurea  medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, to 
prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too low (hypoglycaemia).</p>
<p>medicines that may change the amount of metformin in your blood, especially if you have 
reduced kidney function (such as verapamil, rifampicin, cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, 
trimethoprime, vandetanib, isavuconazole, crizotinib, olaparib).</p>
<p>bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma.</p>
<p>corticosteroids (given by mouth, as an injection, or inhaled), which are used to treat 
inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis.</p>
<p>medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as 
ibuprofen and celecoxib).</p>
<p>certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists).</p>
<p>medicines that contain alcohol (see section  Synjardy with alcohol ).</p>
<p>iodinated contrast agents (medicines used during an X-ray, see section  Warnings and 
precautions .</p>
<p>if you are taking lithium because Synjardy can lower the amount of lithium in your blood.
Synjardy with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Synjardy since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis
(see section  Warnings and precautions ).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Do not take Synjardy if you are pregnant. It is unknown if this medicine is harmful to the unborn 
child.
Metformin passes into human milk in small amounts. It is not known whether empagliflozin passes 
into human breast milk. Do not take Synjardy if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
Synjardy has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Taking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause 
blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, 
sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or 
use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Synjardy.</p>         </div>"""

How much to take
The dose of Synjardy varies depending on your condition and the doses of diabetes medicines you 
currently take. Your doctor will adjust your dose as necessary and tell you exactly which strength of 
the medicine to take.
The recommended dose is one tablet twice a day. Your doctor will normally start Synjardy treatment 
by prescribing the strength of tablet that supplies the same dose of metformin you are already taking 
(850 mg or 1,000 mg twice a day), and the lowest dose of empagliflozin (5 mg twice a day). If you are 
already taking both medicines separately, your doctor will start treatment with tablets of Synjardy that 
will supply the same amount of both. If you have reduced kidney function, your doctor may prescribe 
a lower dose or decide to use an alternative medicine.
Taking this medicine</p>
<p>Swallow the tablet whole with water.</p>
<p>Take the tablets with meals to lower your chance of an upset stomach.</p>
<p>Take the tablet twice daily by mouth.
Your doctor may prescribe Synjardy together with another diabetes medicine. Remember to take all 
medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best results for your health. Your doctor may need 
to adjust your doses to control your blood sugar.
Appropriate diet and exercise help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the 
diet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking Synjardy.
If you take more Synjardy than you should
If you take more Synjardy tablets than you should have, you may experience lactic acidosis. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific such as feeling or being very sick, vomiting, stomach 
ache with muscle cramps, a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness, and difficulty in 
breathing. Further symptoms are reduced body temperature and heartbeat. If this happens to you, you 
may need immediate hospital treatment, as lactic acidosis can lead to coma. Stop taking this 
medicine immediately and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away (see section 2). 
Take the medicine pack with you.
If you forget to take Synjardy
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your 
next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose of this 
medicine.
If you stop taking Synjardy
Do not stop taking Synjardy without first consulting your doctor. Your blood sugar levels may increase 
when you stop taking Synjardy.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
