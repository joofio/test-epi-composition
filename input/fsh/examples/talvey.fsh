antibody, a type of protein that recognises and attaches to specific targets in your body. It has been 
designed to attach to the protien GPRC5D (G Protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D), 
which is found on multiple myeloma cancer cells, and to CD3, a protein on T cells (a type of white 
blood cell). T cells are a part of the body s natural defences and help protect the body from infection. 
They can also destroy cancer cells. When this medicine attaches to these cells, it brings the cancer 
cells and T cells together. This encourages the T cells to destroy the multiple myeloma cancer cells.
Talvey is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.
It is used when patients have had at least three other types of treatment that have not worked or have 
stopped working.</p>         </div>"""

section 6).
Do not use Talvey if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before 
you are given Talvey.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Talvey.
Serious side effects
There are serious side effects that may occur after you start taking Talvey. You need to tell your 
doctor or nurse straight away if these occur, as they may require that you get immediate medical 
attention.
Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you experience any of the following:</p>
<p>signs of a condition known as  cytokine release syndrome  (CRS). CRS is a serious immune 
reaction with symptoms such as fever, low blood pressure, chills, difficulty breathing, fatigue, 
headache, fast heart beat and increased level of liver enzymes in the blood.</p>
<p>effects on your nervous system. Symptoms include feeling confused, feeling disoriented, feeling 
sleepy, feeling less alert, slow or difficulty thinking, altered thinking or decreased conciousness, 
confusion, difficulty speaking and understanding speech. Some of these may be signs of a 
serious immune reaction called  immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome<br />
(ICANS).</p>
<p>problems with the mouth, such as a loss of taste, dry mouth, difficulty swallowing and 
inflammation of the lining of the mouth.</p>
<p>skin problems such as rash, redness and nail problems.</p>
<p>feeling warm, fever, chills or shivering, sore throat or mouth ulcers may be signs of an 
infection.
Talvey and vaccines
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Talvey if you have had a recent vaccination or are 
going to have a vaccination. Your immune system (the body s natural defences) may not respond as 
well to vaccination when you are taking this medicine.
You should not receive live vaccines, a specific type of vaccine, from at least 4 weeks before starting 
your treatment with Talvey until at least 4 weeks after you have taken your last dose.
Tests and checks
Before you are given Talvey your doctor will check your blood to look at the levels of different blood 
cells and to test for signs of infection. Infections will be treated before you start taking this medicine.
After you have Talvey your doctor will monitor you for side effects. They will also regularly check 
your blood counts, as the number of blood cells and other blood components may decrease when you 
use this medicine.
Children and adolescents
Talvey should not be used in children or young people below 18 years of age, because the medicine 
has not been studied in this age group and it is not known how this medicine will affect them.
Other medicines and Talvey
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
This includes medicines you can get without a prescription and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding
Pregnancy and contraception
Talvey has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. The effects of 
Talvey on the developing foetus are unknown and a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
nurse for advice before you are given this medicine.
If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months 
after stopping treatment with Talvey. Your doctor will check if you are pregnant before starting 
treatment.
If your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor straight away.
If you have taken this medicine during pregnancy, your newborn baby should not be given any live 
vaccines until he or she is at least four weeks old.
Breast-feeding
It is not known if Talvey passes into breast milk. There may be a risk to breastfed newborns/infants. 
Ask your doctor for advice before starting this medicine. You and your doctor will decide if the 
benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. If you and your doctor decide to stop 
taking this medicine, you should not breast-feed for 3 months after stopping treatment.
Driving and using machines
Some people may feel tired, dizzy, or confused while taking Talvey. Do not drive, use tools or 
machines from recieving your first dose until at least 48 hours after receiving your first treatment dose 
of Talvey or as instructed by your doctor.
Talvey contains sodium
Talvey contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

Talvey will be given to you under supervision by a doctor experienced in treating patients with 
multiple myeloma. Your doctor will decide how much Talvey you are given. The dose of Talvey will 
depend on your body weight.
Talvey is given either once a week or once every 2 weeks, depending on the dose, as follows:
0.4 mg/kg once a week:</p>
<p>For your first dose, you will receive 0.01 mg per kilogram of bodyweight.</p>
<p>For your second dose, which will be given 2-4 days later, you will receive 0.06 mg per kilogram 
of bodyweight.</p>
<p>For your third dose, you will receive a  Treatment dose  of 0.4 mg per kilogram of bodyweight 
2-4 days after your second dose.</p>
<p>After your third dose, you will then receive a  Treatment dose  once a week thereafter.</p>
<p>Treatment will continue for as long as you benefit from having Talvey.
Your doctor will monitor you for side effects after each of your first three doses. They will do this for 
2 days after each dose. You should stay close to a healthcare facility after each of the first three doses 
in case you have side effects.
If you experience side effects after any of your first two doses, your doctor may decide to wait up to 7 
days before giving you your next dose.
0.8 mg/kg once every 2 weeks:</p>
<p>For your first dose, you will receive 0.01 mg for each kilogram of bodyweight.</p>
<p>For your second dose, which will be given 2-4 days later, you will receive 0.06 mg per kilogram 
of bodyweight.</p>
<p>For your third dose, which will be given 2-4 days later, you will receive 0.4 mg per kilogram of 
bodyweight</p>
<p>For your fourth dose, you will then receive a  Treatment dose  of 0.8 mg per kilogram of 
bodyweight 2-4 days after your third dose.</p>
<p>After your fourth dose, you will then receive a  Treatment dose  once every 2 weeks thereafter.</p>
<p>Treatment will continue for as long as you benefit from having Talvey.
Your doctor will monitor you for side effects after each of your first four doses. They will do this for 
2 days after each dose. You should stay close to a healthcare facility after each of the first four doses 
in case you have side effects.
If you experience side effects after any of your first three doses, your doctor may decide to wait up to 
7 days before giving you your next dose.
The decision to use either the 0.4 mg/kg once weekly or 0.8 mg/kg every two weeks should be made 
in consultation with your doctor.
How the medicine is given
Talvey will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin ( subcutaneous<br />
injection). It is given in the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh.
Medicines given during treatment with Talvey
Before the first three doses (if you are given 0.4 mg/kg bodyweight) or the first four doses (if you are 
given 0.8 mg/kg bodyweight) of Talvey, you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance 
of side effects. These may include:</p>
<p>medicines to reduce an allergic reaction (antihistamines)</p>
<p>medicines to reduce inflammation (corticosteroids)</p>
<p>medicines to reduce fever (such as paracetamol)
You may also be given these medicines for when you take later doses of Talvey based on any 
symptoms you have.
You may also be given additional medicines based on any symptoms you experience or your medical 
history.
If you are given more Talvey than you should
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the event that you are given too much (an 
overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects.
If you forget your appointment to have Talvey
It is very important to go to all your appointments to make sure your treatment works. If you miss an 
appointment, make another one as soon as possible.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
