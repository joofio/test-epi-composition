Talzenna contains the active substance talazoparib. It is a type of anticancer medicine known as a 
 PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor .  </p>
<p>Talzenna works by blocking PARP, which is an enzyme that repairs damaged DNA in certain cancer 
cells. As a result, the cancer cells can no longer repair themselves and they die. </p>
<p>What Talzenna is used for 
Talzenna is a medicine used<br />
- alone to treat adults with breast cancer of a type known as HER2-negative breast cancer who 
have an abnormal inherited BRCA gene. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make 
sure that Talzenna is right for you. 
- in combination with a medicine called enzalutamide, to treat adults with prostate cancer who no 
longer respond to a hormone therapy or surgical treatment to lower testosterone. </p>
<p>Talzenna is used when the cancer has spread beyond the original tumour or to other parts of the body. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Talzenna works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to talazoparib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Talzenna and during your treatment if you 
experience signs or symptoms described in this section. </p>
<p>Low blood cell counts 
Talzenna lowers your blood cell counts, such as your red blood cell count (anaemia), white blood cell 
count (neutropenia), or blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Signs and symptoms you need to 
look out for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anaemia: Being short of breath, feeling very tired, pale skin, or fast heartbeat   these may be 
signs of a low red blood cell count. </li>
<li>Neutropenia: Infection, developing chills or shivering, or fever   these may be signs of a low 
white blood cell count. </li>
<li>Thrombocytopenia: Bruising or bleeding for longer than usual if you hurt yourself   these may 
be signs of a low blood platelet count. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will have regular blood tests during treatment with Talzenna to check your blood cells (white 
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). </p>
<p>Serious problems with the bone marrow<br />
Rarely, low blood cell counts may be a sign of more serious problems with the bone marrow such as 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Your doctor may want to test 
your bone marrow to check for these problems. </p>
<p>Blood clots 
Talzenna may cause blood clots in the veins. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience 
signs or symptoms of blood clots in the veins such as pain or stiffness, swelling and redness in the 
affected leg (or arm), chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness. </p>
<p>Male and female contraception 
Women who can become pregnant and men with partners who are or can become pregnant should use 
effective contraception.<br />
Please see section  Male and female contraception  below. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Talzenna is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Talzenna 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Talzenna can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some medicines can affect the 
way Talzenna works. </p>
<p>In particular, the following may increase the risk of side effects with Talzenna:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amiodarone, carvedilol, dronedarone, propafenone, quinidine, ranolazine and verapamil <br />
generally used to treat heart problems. </li>
<li>Clarithromycin and erythromycin antibiotics   used to treat bacterial infections. </li>
<li>Itraconazole and ketoconazole   used to treat fungal infections. </li>
<li>Cobicistat, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir and tipranavir used to 
treat HIV infections/AIDS. </li>
<li>Ciclosporin   used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection. </li>
<li>Lapatinib   used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer. </li>
<li>Curcumin (e.g. found in turmeric root) in some medicines (see also section Talzenna with food 
and drink below). </li>
</ul>
<p>The following medicines may reduce the effect of Talzenna:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbamazepine and phenytoin   anti-epileptics used to treat seizures or fits. </li>
<li>St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum)   a herbal remedy used to treat mild depression and 
anxiety. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talzenna with food and drink 
Do not use curcumin in food supplements while you are taking Talzenna as it may increase Talzenna s 
side effects. Curcumin is found in turmeric root and you should not use large amounts of turmeric 
root, but using spices in food is not likely to cause a problem. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Talzenna could harm an unborn baby. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine. Your doctor will perform a pregnancy test prior to starting Talzenna. </p>
<ul>
<li>You should not use Talzenna if you are pregnant. </li>
<li>You should not become pregnant while taking Talzenna. </li>
<li>Discuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you or your partner may 
become pregnant.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Male and female contraception 
Women who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during 
treatment with Talzenna and for at least 7 months after the last dose of Talzenna. Since the use of 
hormonal contraception is not recommended if you have breast cancer, you should use two 
non-hormonal contraception methods. 
Talk to your healthcare provider about birth control methods that may be right for you. </p>
<p>Men with female partners who are pregnant or able to become pregnant should use effective birth 
control (contraception), even after a vasectomy, during treatment with Talzenna and for at least 
4 months after the last dose.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed while taking Talzenna and for at least 1 month after the last dose. It is not 
known if Talzenna passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Talazoparib may reduce fertility in men. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Talzenna may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel dizzy, weak, 
or tired (these are very common side effects of Talzenna), you should not drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""
