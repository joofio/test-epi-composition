<li>Tamiflu is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn 
babies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu 
virus is known to be going round in your community. </li>
<li>Tamiflu can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age 
for preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis   for instance, if you have been in contact with 
someone who has flu.  </li>
<li>Tamiflu may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and  infant (including full-term<br />
newborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances   for example, if there 
is a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide 
sufficient protection.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tamiflu contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibitors. 
These medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the 
symptoms of the flu virus infection. </p>
<p>Influenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden 
fever (more than 37.8  C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme 
tiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only 
occurs during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. 
Outside epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness.  </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of Tamiflu 
listed in section 6. Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Tamiflu. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions: 
Before you take Tamiflu, make sure the prescribing doctor knows 
* if you are allergic to other medicines 
* if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment 
* if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation 
* if your immune system is not working 
* if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. </p>
<p>During treatment with Tamiflu, tell a doctor immediately: 
* if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and 
adolescents). These may be signs of rare but serious side effects.  </p>
<p>Tamiflu is not a flu vaccine 
Tamiflu is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you 
antibodies against the virus. Tamiflu will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you might 
be prescribed both by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tamiflu 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are particularly 
important: 
* chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) 
* methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) 
* phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) 
* probenecid (used to treat gout) </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get 
pregnant so that your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. </p>
<p>The effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding so 
that your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Tamiflu has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Information about some of the ingredients of Tamiflu 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Method of administration 
Swallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. </p>
<p>Tamiflu can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance of 
feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). </p>
<p>People who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid medicine, Tamiflu oral suspension. If you 
need Tamiflu oral suspension, but it s not available from your pharmacy, you can make a liquid form 
of Tamiflu from these capsules. See Making liquid Tamiflu at home, over the page. </p>
<p>If you take more Tamiflu than you should<br />
Stop taking Tamiflu and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
In most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, 
they were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. Overdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when Tamiflu was given to children 
than to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Tamiflu for 
children and when administering Tamiflu capsules or liquid Tamiflu to children. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Tamiflu 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Tamiflu 
There are no side effects when you stop Tamiflu. But if Tamiflu is stopped earlier than your doctor 
told you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your doctor 
prescribed. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
