TAVLESSE contains the active substance fostamatinib. It specifically targets an enzyme called spleen 
tyrosine kinase, that plays an important part in the destruction of platelets. In this way TAVLESSE 
limits platelet destruction by the immune system and increases platelet count in the body. This helps 
reduce the risk of severe bleeding. </p>
<p>What TAVLESSE is used for 
TAVLESSE is used to treat adults with low platelet counts due to chronic immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) when an earlier treatment for ITP has not worked well enough. ITP is an autoimmune disease, in 
which the body s own immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood. Platelets are needed 
to help create clots and stop bleeding. </p>         </div>"""
