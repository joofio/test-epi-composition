- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called </p>
<p>DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of </p>
<p>the face, lips, tongue or throat. 
- if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are 
severely reduced (known as myelosuppression). These blood cells are important for fighting 
infection and for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you 
have enough of these cells before you begin treatment. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide SUN, </p>
<ul>
<li>as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection 
called Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you have been newly-diagnosed with 
glioblastoma multiforme you may be receiving Temozolomide SUN for 42 days in combination 
with radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this 
type of pneumonia (PCP). </li>
<li>if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide 
SUN could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients 
will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. </li>
<li>if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood 
clotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your 
blood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temozolomide 
SUN on your blood cells. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change 
your treatment. You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop 
treatment with Temozolomide SUN.  </li>
<li>as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. </li>
<li>if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of 
Temozolomide SUN (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) 
to help prevent vomiting. 
If you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take 
Temozolomide SUN until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do 
not take a second dose on the same day. </li>
<li>if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. </li>
<li>if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or 
bleeding. </li>
<li>if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temozolomide SUN may need to be 
adjusted. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is 
limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide SUN. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Temozolomide SUN 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with 
Temozolomide SUN during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. </p>
<p>Effective contraceptive precautions must be taken by female patients who are able to become pregnant 
during treatment with Temozolomide SUN, and for at least 6 months following completion of 
treatment. </p>
<p>You should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide SUN. </p>
<p>Male fertility 
Temozolomide SUN may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception 
and not father a child for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice 
on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Temozolomide SUN may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or 
machines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). </p>
<p>Temozolomide SUN contains lactose 
Temozolomide SUN contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you 
have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Dosage and duration of treatment </p>
<p>Your doctor will work out your dose of Temozolomide SUN. This is based on your size (height and 
weight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. 
You may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temozolomide 
SUN to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. </p>
<p>Patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme </p>
<p>If you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first </li>
<li>followed by treatment with Temozolomide SUN only (monotherapy phase). </li>
</ul>
<p>During the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temozolomide SUN at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual 
dose). You will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. The 
Temozolomide SUN dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you 
tolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. 
Once the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body 
a chance to recover. 
Then, you will start the monotherapy phase. </p>
<p>During the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide SUN can vary. Your doctor 
will work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts days. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide SUN once 
daily for the first 5 days ( dosing days ) of each cycle. Then you will have 23 days without 
Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. 
After day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 days 
followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. The Temozolomide SUN dose may be adjusted, 
delayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each 
treatment cycle. </p>
<p>Patients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma 
multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temozolomide SUN only </p>
<p>A treatment cycle with Temozolomide SUN lasts 28 days. 
You will take Temozolomide SUN only once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on 
whether or not you have received chemotherapy before. </p>
<p>If you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN 
will be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with 
chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 
days. Then, you will have 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment 
cycle. </p>
<p>After day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 
days, followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. </p>
<p>Before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temozolomide SUN dose 
needs to be adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the 
next cycle. </p>
<p>How to take Temozolomide SUN </p>
<p>Take your prescribed dose of Temozolomide SUN once a day, preferably at the same time each day. </p>
<p>Take the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat 
breakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the 
capsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you 
accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  </p>
<p>Depending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule at the same time. You 
may have to take different strengths to make up the dose. The marking on the capsule is different for 
each strength (see table below). </p>

<p>You should make sure you fully understand and remember the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to 
write it down (including the marking) </li>
<li>which days are your dosing days. 
Review the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the 
last cycle. </li>
</ul>
<p>Always take Temozolomide SUN exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check 
with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Making a mistake in how you take this medicine 
may have serious health consequences. </p>
<p>If you take more Temozolomide SUN than you should 
If you accidentally take more Temozolomide SUN capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Temozolomide SUN 
Take the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with 
your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to 
do so. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

resistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may 
be prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will 
monitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In 
some cases, your Temozolomide SUN dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. </p>
