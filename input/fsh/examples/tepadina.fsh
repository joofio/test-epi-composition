<p>TEPADINA is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplantation. It works by destroying bone 
marrow cells. This enables the transplantation of new bone marrow cells (haematopoietic progenitor 
cells), which in turn enable the body to produce healthy blood cells. 
TEPADINA can be used in adults and children and adolescents. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warning and precautions 
You should tell your doctor if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>liver or kidney problems, </li>
<li>heart or lung problems, </li>
<li>seizures/fits (epilepsy) or have had them in the past (if treated with phenytoin or fosphenytoin). </li>
</ul>
<p>Because TEPADINA destroys bone marrow cells responsible for producing blood cells, regular blood 
tests will be taken during treatment to check your blood cell counts. </p>
<p>In order to prevent and manage infections, you will be given anti-infectives. </p>
<p>TEPADINA may cause another type of cancer in the future. Your doctor will discuss this risk with 
you. </p>
<p>Other medicines and TEPADINA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or you think you may be pregnant before you receive 
TEPADINA. You must not use TEPADINA during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Both women and men using TEPADINA must use effective contraceptive methods during treatment. 
Men should not father a child while treated with TEPADINA and during the year after cessation of 
treatment. </p>
<p>It is not known whether this medicinal product is excreted in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, 
women must not breast-feed during treatment with TEPADINA. </p>
<p>TEPADINA can impair male and female fertility. Male patients should seek advice for sperm 
preservation before therapy is started. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is likely that certain adverse reactions of thiotepa like dizziness, headache and blurred vision could 
affect your ability to drive and use machines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""
