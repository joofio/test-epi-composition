Tepkinly is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance epcoritamab. Tepkinly is used on its 
own (monotherapy) to treat adult patients who have a blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) when the disease has come back or did not respond to previous treatment after at 
least two prior therapies.
How Tepkinly works 
Epcoritamab is specifically designed to help your own immune system to attack cancer (lymphoma)
cells. Epcoritamab acts by attaching to your body s immune cells and cancer cells, bringing them 
together, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer cells.</p>         </div>"""

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tepkinly.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tepkinly if you</p>
<p>have current or past problems with your nervous system   such as seizures</p>
<p>have an infection</p>
<p>are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given
Tepkinly.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of any of the side effects listed below, during or 
after treatment with Tepkinly. You may need additional medical treatment.</p>
<p>Cytokine release syndrome   a life-threatening condition causing fever, vomiting, difficulty 
breathing/shortness of breath, chills, rapid heartbeat, headache and dizziness or light-
headedness associated with medicines that stimulate T cells. 
  Before each injection under the skin, you may be given medicines which help reduce 
possible effects of cytokine release syndrome.</p>
<p>ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome)- Symptoms may 
include problems with use of language (including speech, understanding, writing and 
reading), drowsiness, confusion/disorientation, muscle weakness, seizures, swelling of a part 
of the brain, and memory loss.</p>
<p>Tumour lysis syndrome   some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood<br />
caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This is called tumour lysis 
syndrome (TLS).* Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each 
injection under the skin, you should be well-hydrated and may be given other 
medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric acid and help reduce possible 
effects of tumour lysis syndrome.</p>
<p>Tumour flare   as your cancer is destroyed, it may react and appear to get worse   this is 
called  tumour flare reaction .</p>
<p>Infections   you may get signs of infection, such as fever of 38  C or above, chills, cough, or 
pain with urination which can vary depending on where in the body the infection is.
Children and adolescents
Tepkinly is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years, as there is no information 
about use in this age group.
Other medicines and Tepkinly
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or using, have recently taken or used, or might take or 
use any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Tepkinly during pregnancy, as it may 
affect your unborn baby. Your doctor may ask you to take a pregnancy test before starting treatment. 
Contraception

becoming pregnant while taking Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after your last dose of Tepkinly. If

Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception.
Breast-feeding
You must not breast-feed during treatment with Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after the last dose. It 
is not known whether Tepkinly passes into breast milk and whether it could affect your baby.
Fertility
The effect of Tepkinly on male and female fertility is unknown.
Driving and using machines
Due to the possible symptoms of ICANS, you should be careful while driving, cycling or using heavy or 
potentially dangerous machines. If you currently have such symptoms, avoid these activities and contact 
your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. See section 4 for more information about side effects.

Cycle
Dosing schedule
Cycles 1 to 3
Weekly
Cycles 4 to 9
Every two weeks

You may be given other medicines before you are given Tepkinly. This is to help prevent reactions such 
as cytokine release syndrome and fever in Cycle 1 (and potentially future cycles). 
These medicines may include </p>
<p>Corticosteroids   such as prednisolone or equivalent </p>
<p>An antihistamine   such as diphenhydramine </p>
<p>Paracetamol
The first full dose (48 mg) of Tepkinly will be given to you on Cycle 1 Day 15. Your doctor will 
monitor how your treatment is working and ask you to stay in a hospital for 24 hours after the first full 
dose (48 mg) because this is when reactions such as CRS, ICANS and fever are most likely to happen.
You will be given Tepkinly for as long as your doctor thinks you are benefitting from the treatment.
Your doctor may delay or completely stop your treatment with Tepkinly if you have certain side effects.
If you forget to use Tepkinly
If you forget or miss your medical appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be 
fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.

stopping treatment may make your condition worse.
