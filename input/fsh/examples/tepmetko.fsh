<p>TEPMETKO is used to treat adults with lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or 
cannot be removed by surgery. The medicine is given, when the cancer cells have an alteration in the 
MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) gene and previous treatment has not helped to stop 
your disease. </p>
<p>An alteration in the MET gene can lead to production of an abnormal protein, which can then cause 
uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. By blocking the action of the abnormal protein, TEPMETKO 
may slow or stop the cancer from growing. It may also help to shrink the cancer. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you have any questions. </p>
<p>Lung or breathing problems 
TEPMETKO can sometimes cause sudden breathing difficulties that may be associated with a fever 
and cough. Tell your doctor right away if you develop any new or worsening symptoms (see section 4) 
as these may be signs of a serious lung condition (interstitial lung disease) which needs immediate 
attention. Your doctor may need to treat you with other medicines and interrupt your TEPMETKO 
treatment. </p>
<p>Monitoring of liver function 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests to check how well your liver is working before you are treated 
with TEPMETKO, and as necessary during treatment. </p>
<p>Monitoring of heart function 
Your doctor may carry out ECG tests as necessary during treatment to check whether TEPMETKO 
affects your heart rhythm. </p>
<p>Contraception 
This medicine should not be used in pregnancy as it can harm the unborn baby. Men and women 
should use effective contraception during TEPMETKO treatment and for at least 1 week after the last 
dose. Your doctor will give you guidance on appropriate methods of contraception. See  Pregnancy<br />
below. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine has not been studied in patients below the age of 18 years. </p>

<p>Contraception in males and females 
If you are female and able to have children, you should use an effective method of contraception to 
avoid becoming pregnant during TEPMETKO treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose. 
Talk to your doctor if you take hormonal contraceptives (e.g.  the pill ) as you will need a second 
method of contraception during this time. </p>
<p>If you are male, you should use a barrier method of contraception to prevent your partner from getting 
pregnant, while you are treated with TEPMETKO and for at least 1 week after the last dose. </p>
<p>Your doctor will give you guidance on appropriate methods of contraception. </p>
