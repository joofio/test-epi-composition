Teriflunomide Accord contains the active substance teriflunomide which is an immunomodulatory agent and 
adjusts the immune system to limit its attack on the nervous system. </p>
<p>What Teriflunomide Accord is used for 
Teriflunomide Accord is used in adults and in children and adolescents (10 years of age and older) to treat 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). </p>
<p>What multiple sclerosis is 
MS is a long-term illness that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of the brain 
and spinal cord. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called myelin) around the 
nerves in the CNS. This loss of myelin is called demyelination. This stops nerves from working properly. </p>
<p>People with relapsing form of multiple sclerosis will have repeated attacks (relapses) of physical symptoms 
caused by their nerves not working properly. These symptoms vary from patient to patient but usually 
involve: 
* difficulty walking 
* vision problems 
* balance problems. </p>
<p>Symptoms may disappear completely after the relapse is over, but over time, some problems may remain 
between relapses. This can cause physical disabilities that may interfere with your daily activities. </p>
<p>How Teriflunomide Accord works 
Teriflunomide Accord helps to protect against attacks on the central nervous system by the immune system 
by limiting the increase of some white blood cells (lymphocytes). This limits the inflammation that leads to 
nerve damage in MS. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Teriflunomide Accord if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have liver problems and/or if you drink large amounts of alcohol. Your doctor will carry out blood 
tests before and during treatment to check how well your liver is working. If your test results show a 
problem with your liver, your doctor may stop your treatment with Teriflunomide Accord. Please read 
section 4. - you have high blood pressure (hypertension) whether it is controlled with medicines or not. 
Teriflunomide Accord can cause an increase in blood pressure. Your doctor will check your blood 
pressure before the start of treatment and regularly thereafter. Please read section 4. - you have an infection. Before you take Teriflunomide Accord, your doctor will make sure you have 
enough white blood cells and platelets in your blood. As Teriflunomide Accord decreases the number 
of white cells in the blood this may affect your ability to fight the infection. Your doctor may do blood 
tests to check your white blood cells if you think you have an infection. Please read section 4. - you have severe skin reactions. </li>
<li>you have respiratory symptoms. </li>
<li>you have weakness, numbness and pain in the hands and feet. </li>
<li>you are going to have a vaccination. </li>
<li>you take leflunomide with Teriflunomide Accord. </li>
<li>you are switching to or from Teriflunomide Accord. </li>
<li>you are due to have a specific blood test (calcium level). Falsely low levels of calcium can be detected. </li>
</ul>
<p>Respiratory reactions 
Tell your doctor if you have unexplained cough and dyspnoea (shortness of breath). Your doctor may 
perform additional tests </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Teriflunomide Accord is not intended for use in children under 10 years of age, as it has not been studied in 
MS patients in this age group.<br />
The warnings and precautions listed above also apply to children. The following information is important for 
children and their caregivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>inflammation of the pancreas has been observed in patients receiving teriflunomide. Your child s 
doctor may carry out blood tests if an inflammation to the pancreas is suspected.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Teriflunomide Accord

includes medicines obtained without a prescription. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:</p>

immunosuppressants or immunomodulators) </li>

<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Teriflunomide Accord if you are or think you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant or become 
pregnant while taking Teriflunomide Accord, the risk of having a baby with birth defects is increased. 
Women of childbearing potential must not take this medicine without using reliable contraceptive measures. 
If your daughter reaches menses while taking Teriflunomide Accord, you should inform the doctor, who will 
provide specialist counselling regarding contraception and the potential risks in case of pregnancy.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with Teriflunomide Accord, as 
you need to ensure that most of this medicine has left your body before trying to become pregnant. The 
elimination of the active substance may take up to 2 years to occur naturally. The time can be reduced to a 
few weeks by taking certain medicines which speed up removal of teriflunomide from your body.<br />
In either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that the active substance has been sufficiently removed 
from your body and you need confirmation from your treating physician that the blood level of teriflunomide 
is low enough to allow you to become pregnant. </p>
<p>For further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you suspect that you are pregnant while taking Teriflunomide Accord or in the two years after you have 
stopped treatment, you must discontinue Teriflunomide Accord and contact your doctor immediately for a 
pregnancy test. If the test confirms that you are pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with certain 
medicines to remove teriflunomide rapidly and sufficiently from your body, as this may decrease the risk to 
your baby. </p>
<p>Contraception 
You must use an effective method of contraception during and after treatment with Teriflunomide Accord. 
Teriflunomide remains in your blood for a long time after you stop taking it. Continue to use effective 
contraception after you stop treatment. 
- Do this until the levels of teriflunomide in your blood are low enough - your doctor will check this. 
- Talk with your doctor about the best method of contraception for you and any potential need for 
contraception change. </p>
<p>Do not take Teriflunomide Accord when you are breast-feeding, as teriflunomide passes into the breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Teriflunomide Accord might make you feel dizzy which may impair your ability to concentrate and react. If 
you are affected, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Teriflunomide Accord contains lactose 
Teriflunomide Accord contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have 
an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.<br />
Teriflunomide Accord contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
