  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tevimbra is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance tislelizumab. It is a monoclonal 
antibody, a type of protein that is designed to recognise and attach to a specific target in the body 
called programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) which is found on the surface of T and B cells (types of 
white blood cells that form part of the immune system, the body s natural defences). When PD-1 is 
activated by cancer cells it can switch off the activity of T cells. By blocking PD-1, Tevimbra prevents 
it from switching off your T cells which helps your immune system fight the cancer. </p>
<p>Tevimbra is used in adults to treat: 
* a type of oesophageal cancer called oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma that has spread to 
other parts of the body, has already been treated by anti-cancer therapy and cannot be removed 
by surgery. </p>

you, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

</ul>
<p>For more information on the symptoms of any of the above, read section 4 ( Possible side

<p>Patient Card 
You will also find key information from this package leaflet in the Patient Card that you have been 
given by your doctor. It is important that you carry the Patient Card with you at all times and show it 
to a healthcare professional in case of signs and symptoms that may indicate immune-related adverse 
reactions (listed above under  Look out for serious side effects ), for a prompt diagnosis and adequate 
treatment. </p>
<p>Monitoring during your treatment with Tevimbra 
Your doctor will carry out regular tests (liver function tests, kidney function tests, radiographic 
imaging tests) before and during treatment. </p>
<p>Your doctor will also carry out regular blood tests before and during treatment with Tevimbra to 
monitor the blood sugar and hormone levels in your body. This is because blood sugar and hormone 
levels can be affected by Tevimbra. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Tevimbra should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tevimbra 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that suppress your immune system, 
including corticosteroids (such as prednisone), since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
Tevimbra. However, once you have started treatment with Tevimbra, your doctor may give you 
corticosteroids to reduce any side effects that you may have. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not be given Tevimbra if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically prescribes it for 
you. The effects of Tevimbra in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active 
substance, tislelizumab, could harm an unborn baby. 
- If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception while 
you are being treated with Tevimbra and for at least 4 months following the last dose of 
Tevimbra. 
- If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Tevimbra passes into breast milk. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be 
ruled out. If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. You should not breast-feed during treatment with 
Tevimbra and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Tevimbra. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Tevimbra has a minor effect on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Feeling tired or weak are possible side effects of Tevimbra. Do not drive or use machines after you 
have been given Tevimbra unless you are sure you are feeling well. </p>
<p>Tevimbra contains sodium 
Tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given Tevimbra. This 
medicine contains 1.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each ml of concentrate. A 
single infusion of Tevimbra contains 32 mg sodium in two 10 ml vials. This is equivalent to 1.6% of 
the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""
