TOBI Podhaler contains a medicine called tobramycin which is an antibiotic. This antibiotic belongs 
to a class called aminoglycosides. </p>
<p>What TOBI Podhaler is used for 
TOBI Podhaler is used in patients aged 6 years and older who have cystic fibrosis to treat lung 
infections caused by bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </p>
<p>For the best results from this medicine, please use it as this leaflet instructs you. </p>
<p>How TOBI Podhaler works 
TOBI Podhaler is a powder for inhalation that is filled into capsules. When you inhale TOBI Podhaler, 
the antibiotic can enter directly into your lungs to fight against the bacteria causing the infection and to 
improve your breathing. </p>
<p>What is Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
It is a very common bacterium that infects the lungs of nearly everyone with cystic fibrosis at some 
time during their lives. Some people do not get this infection until later on in their lives, while others 
get it very young. It is one of the most damaging bacteria for people with cystic fibrosis. If the 
infection is not properly fought, it will continue to damage your lungs, causing further problems to 
your breathing. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to tobramycin, to any type of aminoglycoside antibiotic, or to any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking TOBI Podhaler. 
If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
Warnings and precautions 
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any of the following conditions: 
* hearing problems (including noises in the ears and dizziness), or your mother has had hearing 
problems after taking an aminoglycoside 
* certain gene variants (a change in the gene) related to hearing abnormalities inherited from your 
mother 
* kidney problems 
* unusual difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing, chest tightness 
* blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up) 
* muscle weakness that lasts or becomes worse over time, a symptom mostly related to conditions 
such as myasthenia or Parkinson s disease. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking TOBI Podhaler. </p>
<p>If you are aged 65 years or older, your doctor may perform additional tests to decide if TOBI Podhaler 
is right for you. </p>
<p>Inhaling medicines can cause chest tightness and wheezing and this can happen immediately after 
inhalation of TOBI Podhaler. Your doctor will supervise your first dose of TOBI Podhaler and check 
your lung function before and after dosing. Your doctor may ask you to use other appropriate 
medicines before taking TOBI Podhaler. </p>
<p>Inhaling medicines can also cause cough and this can happen with TOBI Podhaler. Talk to your doctor 
if the cough is persistent and is a burden for you. </p>
<p>Strains of Pseudomonas can become resistant to treatment with an antibiotic over time. This means 
that TOBI Podhaler may not work as well as it should over time. Talk to your doctor if you are 
concerned about this. </p>
<p>If you are taking tobramycin or another aminoglycoside antibiotic by injection, it can sometimes cause 
hearing loss, dizziness and kidney damage. </p>
<p>Children 
TOBI Podhaler should not be given to children less than 6 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and TOBI Podhaler 
Tell your doctor or a pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>You should not take the following medicines while you are taking TOBI Podhaler: 
* Furosemide or ethacrynic acid, diuretics 
* Other medicines with diuretic properties such as urea or intravenous mannitol 
* Other medicines which may harm your kidneys or hearing. </p>
<p>The following medicines can increase the chances of harmful effects occurring if they are given to you 
while you are also receiving injections of tobramycin or other aminoglycoside antibiotic: 
* Amphotericin B, cefalotin, polymyxins (used to treat microbial infections), ciclosporin, 
tacrolimus (used to reduce the activity of immune system). These medicines may harm the 
kidneys. 
* Platinum compounds such as carboplatin and cisplatin (used to treat some forms of cancer). 
These medicines may harm the kidneys or hearing. 
* Anticholinesterases such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine (used to treat muscle weakness), or 
botulinum toxin. These medicines may cause muscle weakness to appear or become worse.. </p>
<p>If you are taking one or more of the above medicines, discuss with your doctor before you take TOBI 
Podhaler. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not known whether inhaling this medicine when you are pregnant causes side effects. </p>
<p>When they are given by an injection, tobramycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics can cause harm 
to an unborn child, such as deafness. </p>
<p>If you are breast feeding, you should talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
TOBI Podhaler has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>         </div>"""
