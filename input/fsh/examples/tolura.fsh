  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tolura belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin II is 
a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus increasing your 
blood pressure. Tolura blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your 
blood pressure is lowered.
Tolura is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults.  Essential  means that 
the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead 
sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms 
of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure 
to verify if it is within the normal range.
Tolura is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults who are at 
risk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke or 
have high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events.</p>         </div>"""

<h2>if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</h2>
<p>if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Tolura in early pregnancy<br />
see pregnancy section.)
-
if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.
-
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tolura.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or 
illnesses:
-
Kidney disease or kidney transplant.
-
Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).
-
Liver disease.
-
Heart trouble.
-
Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various 
blood minerals).
-
Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body 
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or 
vomiting.
-
Elevated potassium levels in your blood.
-
Diabetes.
Talk to your doctor before taking Tolura:
-
if you are taking digoxin.
-
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:
-
an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems,
-
aliskiren.
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Tolura is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).
In case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Tolura.
Tolura may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals.
See also information under the heading  Do not take Tolura .
Children and adolescents
The use of Tolura in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.
Other medicines and Tolura
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other 
precautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially 
to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Tolura:
-
Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.
-
Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing 
potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain 'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or 
ibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic 
trimethoprim.
-
Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Tolura, may lead to 
excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).
-
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not 
take Tolura  and  Warnings and precautions ).
-
Digoxin.
The effect of Tolura may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.
Tolura may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood 
pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). 
Furthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or 
antidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your 
doctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Tolura.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Pregnancy
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Tolura before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant 
and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Tolura. Tolura is not recommended in early 
pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to 
your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Tolura is not recommended 
for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish 
to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.
Driving and using machines
Some people feel dizzy or tired when taking Tolura. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate 
machinery.
Tolura contains lactose and sorbitol (E420).
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor
before taking this medicinal product.
This medicine contains 149.8 mg sorbitol in each tablet. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor 
has told you that you have an intolerance to some sugars or if you have been diagnosed with hereditary 
fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot break down fructose, talk 
to your doctor before you take or receive this medicine.</p>         </div>"""

are not sure.
The recommended dose of Tolura is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. 
You can take Tolura with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other 
non-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Tolura every day until your doctor tells you 
otherwise. If you have the impression that the effect of Tolura is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist.
For treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Tolura for most patients is one 40 mg tablet 
once a day to control blood pressure over the 24 hour period. However, sometimes your doctor may 
recommend a lower dose of 20 mg or a higher dose of 80 mg. Tolura tablets cannot be divided, 
therefore they are not suitable for patients who require a dose of 20 mg of telmisartan. For these 
patients, an equivalent product with the same active ingredient is available. Tolura may also be used in 
combination with diuretics ('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have 
an additive blood pressure lowering effect with Tolura.
For reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Tolura is one 80 mg tablet once a day. At the 
beginning of the preventive therapy with Tolura 80 mg, blood pressure should be frequently 
monitored.
If your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.
If you take more Tolura than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital 
emergency department immediately.
If you forget to take Tolura
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If 
you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
