contact with the skin, it should be washed off straight away. This is especially important in 
women who are pregnant or are attempting to become pregnant. </p>

wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in. </p>

should check with your doctor, the doctor treating your child or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 
One drop in the affected eye or eyes, once a day - in the evening.

doctor treating your child told you to. </p>

<p>Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, tear open the overwrap pouch, take the 
bottle out (picture 1) and write the date of opening on the carton in the space provided </p>
<p>Wash your hands </p>
<p>Twist off the cap </p>
<p>Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers </p>
<p>Tilt your head or your child s head gently back. Pull down the eyelid with a clean finger, until 
there is a  pocket  between the eyelid and the eye. The drop will go in here (picture 2) </p>
<p>Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use a mirror if it helps </p>
<p>Do not touch the eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It 
could infect the drops </p>
<p>Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of TRAVATAN at a time. (picture 3) </p>
<p>After using TRAVATAN, keep the eyelid closed, apply gentle pressure by pressing a finger into 
the corner of the eye, by the nose (picture 4) for at least 1 minute. This helps to stop 
TRAVATAN getting into the rest of the body </p>
<p>If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for the other eye </p>
<p>Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use </p>
<p>Only use one bottle at a time. Do not open the pouch until you need to use the bottle. </p>
<p>If a drop misses the eye, try again. </p>
<p>If you or your child are using other eye preparations such as eye drop or eye ointment, wait for at 
least 5 minutes between putting in TRAVATAN and the other eye preparations. </p>
<p>If you or your child receive more TRAVATAN than you should 
Rinse all the medicine out with warm water. Don t put in any more drops until it s time for the next 
regular dose. </p>
<p>If you forget to use TRAVATAN 
Continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
Never use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) in a single day. </p>
<p>If you stop using TRAVATAN 
Do not stop using TRAVATAN without first speaking to your doctor or the doctor treating your child, 
the pressure in your eye or your child s eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight. </p>

child or pharmacist. </p>
