  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Trodelvy is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance sacituzumab govitecan. One part of 
the medicine is a monoclonal antibody that attaches specifically to a protein on the surface of breast 
cancer cells called Trop-2. The other active part of Trodelvy is SN-38, a substance that can kill cancer 
cells. Once the medicine has attached to cancer cells, the SN-38 enters the cancer cells and kills them, 
thereby helping to fight your cancer. </p>
<p>Trodelvy is used to treat a type of breast cancer in adults called triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC). Trodelvy should only be used after patients have tried at least two other treatments for their 
cancer, including at least one of them for a locally advanced cancer or metastasised cancer. </p>
<p>Trodelvy is used to treat a type of breast cancer in adults called hormone receptor -positive 
(HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Trodelvy 
should only be used after patients have tried a treatment including a hormonal anticancer treatment and 
at least two additional other treatments for a locally advanced cancer or metastasised cancer. </p>
<p>The medicine is used when it is not possible to remove the cancer with surgery, because the cancer has 
spread to areas outside the breast (locally advanced) or has spread to other sites in the body 
(metastasised).  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Trodelvy works or why this 
medicine has been prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""

advice. 
Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Infusion-related reactions </p>
<p>Trodelvy is given by drip into a vein. Some people may develop infusion-related reactions which can 
be severe or life-threatening. Seek urgent medical attention if you have any of the following signs 
and symptoms of infusion-related reactions: 
* itching 
* sudden outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin<br />
* fever 
* sudden severe shivering accompanied by a feeling of coldness 
* excessive sweating 
* breathing difficulties and wheezing 
* chest pain, heart palpitations 
Your doctor may give you medicines before Trodelvy to help relieve the symptoms. During each 
infusion and for 30 minutes after, you will be closely monitored for these signs and symptoms of 
infusion-related reactions. Your doctor will slow down the infusion rate or stop it if you develop a 
serious infusion-related reaction. </p>
<p>Neutropenia </p>
<p>This medicine can cause neutropenia, a condition where there are too few neutrophils in your blood, 
which increases the risk of infections. These infections can be severe, life-threatening and may lead to 
death. Seek urgent medical attention if you have the following signs and symptoms of neutropenia 
or infections:<br />
<em> a fever (a temperature of 38.5 C or higher) 
* chills or sweating<br />
</em> sore throat, sores in the mouth, or a toothache<br />
<em> stomach pain<br />
</em> pain near the anus 
* pain or burning when urinating, or urinating more often 
* diarrhoea or sores around the anus 
* a cough or shortness of breath 
Your doctor will take blood samples to monitor the levels of neutrophils in your blood. You will not 
be given Trodelvy if the neutrophils are below a certain level on Day 1 or Day 8 of any treatment 
cycle.<br />
Your doctor will adjust the amount of medicine you are given if you have severe neutropenia.  </p>
<p>Diarrhoea </p>
<p>Seek urgent medical attention if you suffer from severe diarrhoea whilst receiving Trodelvy. 
Your Trodelvy treatment will be postponed until your diarrhoea has improved. You will be given 
loperamide to treat your diarrhoea, as long as you do not have an infection. If appropriate, you will 
also be given fluids. 
Your doctor may also give you medicine, such as atropine, to help with stomach cramps, diarrhoea, 
and excessive saliva in mouth before your next treatment infusion.<br />
Your diarrhoea can lead to dehydration and sudden kidney damage. Talk to your doctor if you 
experience dark-coloured urine or decreased urine volume.  </p>
<p>Nausea and vomiting </p>
<p>This medicine can cause nausea and vomiting. Seek urgent medical attention if you suffer from 
severe nausea and vomiting whilst receiving Trodelvy. 
Your doctor will give you some medicines before your cancer therapy, and in between infusion 
sessions to help relieve nausea and vomiting. You will not be given Trodelvy if you have severe 
nausea and vomiting, and will only be given Trodelvy when the symptoms have been controlled. </p>
<p>Patients who have the UGT1A1*28 gene </p>
<p>Some patients are more likely to have certain side effects from the medicine due to their genetic make-
up. If you have the UGT1A1*28 gene, your body breaks the medicine down more slowly. This means 
you are more likely to develop certain side effects (such as neutropenia with or without fever and low 
level of red blood cells (anaemia)), than those who do not have the gene. These patients will be closely 
followed-up by their doctor.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, or nurse before you are given Trodelvy if you: 
* have liver problems 
* have kidney problems 
* are a female of child-bearing age (see  Pregnancy ,  Male and female Contraception  and 
 Breast-feeding ) 
* are taking medicines to treat other conditions (see  Other medicines and Trodelvy ) 
* have experienced any problems after receiving any infusions in the past. </p>
<p>While you are being given Trodelvy, your doctor will monitor you closely for side effects. If you get 
any serious side effects, your doctor may give you other medicines to treat these side effects, they may 
change how much Trodelvy you receive or may stop giving you Trodelvy altogether. </p>
<p>See section 4. for a list of all the possible side effects related to Trodelvy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Trodelvy should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years old because there is no 
information on how it works in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Trodelvy </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.<br />
Some medicines may affect the way Trodelvy works and may raise the level of Trodelvy s active 
substance in your blood, increasing the risk of side effects. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>propofol, given as an anesthetic in surgery. </li>
<li>ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections. </li>
<li>tyrosine kinase inhibitors, used to treat cancer (medicines ending in -nib).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Some medicines may lower the level of Trodelvy s active substance in your blood, decreasing its 
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>carbamazepine or phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy. </li>
<li>rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis. </li>
<li>ritonavir or tipranavir, used to treat HIV. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Trodelvy should not be used during pregnancy because it may harm the baby. Tell your doctor 
immediately if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.  </p>
<p>Male and female contraception </p>
<p>Women who might get pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment with Trodelvy, and 
for 6 months after the last dose of Trodelvy. 
Men with female partners who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during 
treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of Trodelvy. 
Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Trodelvy and for 1 month after the last dose. It is unknown 
whether this medicine passes into breast milk and could affect the baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Trodelvy may affect your ability to drive and use machines e.g. feeling dizzy, fatigue. You should 
therefore be cautious when driving, using tools or operating machines after being given Trodelvy. </p>         </div>"""

therapies. </p>
<p>It is important that your doctor or nurse specialising in your care has confirmed you can take this 
medicine by carrying out a blood test prior to treatment. </p>
<p>Medicines given before Trodelvy treatment 
You will be given some medicines before receiving Trodelvy to help stop infusion-related reactions 
and any nausea and vomiting. Your doctor will decide what medicines you may need and how much to 
take. </p>
<p>How much Trodelvy you will be given 
Treatment for your cancer is repeated in 21-day (3-week) cycles. The recommended dose of Trodelvy 
is 10 mg for each kg of your body weight at the start of each cycle (Day 1 of each cycle) and again 
one week later (Day 8 of each cycle). </p>
<p>How you will be given your medicine 
A doctor or nurse will give the medicine via an intravenous infusion (a drip into your vein). 
First infusion: you will be given your first infusion of medicine over 3 hours.<br />
Second and subsequent infusions: you will be given the other infusions over 1 to 2 hours if your first 
infusion was uneventful.<br />
Your doctor or nurse will monitor you during and for 30 minutes after each infusion for signs and 
symptoms of infusion-related reactions. </p>
<p>Infusion-related reactions 
Your doctor will slow down the infusion rate of your medicine if you develop an infusion-related 
reaction. The medicine will be stopped if the infusion-related reaction is life-threatening. See 
section 2. Dose of medicine when experiencing some side-effects 
Your doctor may change or stop your dose if you experience certain side effects. See section 4. If you are given more Trodelvy than you should </p>
<p>Since the infusion is given to you by your doctor or other appropriately trained staff, an overdose is 
unlikely. If you inadvertently receive too much medicine, your doctor will monitor you and give you 
additional treatment as required. 
If a dose of Trodelvy is missed </p>
<p>If you forget or miss your appointment, call your doctor or your treatment centre to make another 
appointment as soon as possible. Do not wait until your next planned visit. For the treatment to be 
fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose. </p>
<p>If you stop treatment with Trodelvy </p>
<p>You should not stop the therapy early without talking with your doctor first. </p>
<p>The therapy for breast cancer with Trodelvy usually requires a number of treatments. The number of 
infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to treatment. Therefore, you should 
continue receiving Trodelvy even if you see your symptoms improve and until your doctor decides 
that Trodelvy should be stopped. If the treatment is stopped too early, your symptoms may return.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
