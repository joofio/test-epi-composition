* beclometasone dipropionate,<br />
<em> formoterol fumarate dihydrate and<br />
</em> glycopyrronium.  </p>
<p>Beclometasone dipropionate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids which act to 
reduce the swelling and irritation in your lungs. </p>
<p>Formoterol and glycopyrronium are medicines called long-acting bronchodilators. They act in 
different ways to relax the muscles in your airways, helping to open the airways wider and allowing 
you to breathe more easily. </p>
<p>Regular treatment with these three active substances helps to relieve and prevent symptoms such as 
shortness of breath, wheezing and cough in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). Trydonis can reduce exacerbations (flare-ups) of COPD symptoms. COPD is a serious long-
term disease in which the airways become blocked and air sacs inside the lungs become damaged, 
leading to difficulty breathing. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate dihydrate and/or 
glycopyrronium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Trydonis is used as a maintenance treatment for your obstructive lung disease. Do not use this 
medicine to treat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. </p>
<p>If your breathing gets worse </p>
<p>If you develop worsening shortness of breath or wheezing (breathing with a whistling sound), straight 
after inhaling your medicine, stop using Trydonis inhaler and use your quick-acting  reliever  inhaler 
straightaway. You should contact your doctor straightaway. Your doctor will assess your symptoms 
and if necessary may start you on a different treatment.<br />
See also section 4,  Possible side effects . </p>
<p>If your lung disease gets worse </p>
<p>If your symptoms get worse or are difficult to control (e.g. if you are using a separate  reliever<br />
inhaler more frequently) or if your  reliever  inhaler does not improve your symptoms, see your 
doctor immediately. Your lung disease may be getting worse and your doctor may need to prescribe 
different treatment. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Trydonis: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you have any heart problems, such as angina (heart pain, pain in the chest), a recent heart 
attack (myocardial infarction), heart failure, narrowing of the arteries around your heart 
(coronary heart disease), disease of your heart valves or any other abnormalities of your heart or 
if you have a condition known as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (also known as 
HOCM, a condition where the heart muscle is abnormal). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have disorders of your heart rhythm such as irregular heart rate, a fast pulse rate or 
palpitations or if you have been told that your heart trace (ECG) is abnormal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have narrowing of the arteries (also known as arteriosclerosis), if you have high blood 
pressure or if you have an aneurysm (abnormal bulging of the blood vessel wall). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have an overactive thyroid gland. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have low blood levels of potassium (hypokalaemia). The combination of Trydonis with 
some other COPD medicines or medicines such as diuretics (medicines that make the body lose 
water, to treat heart disease or high blood pressure), can cause a sharp fall in your blood level of 
potassium. Therefore, your doctor may wish to measure the potassium levels in your blood from 
time to time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have any disease of your liver or kidneys. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have diabetes. High doses of formoterol may increase your blood glucose and therefore 
you may need to have extra blood tests to check your blood sugar when you start using this 
medicine, and from time to time during treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as a phaeochromocytoma). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are due to have an anaesthetic. Depending on the type of anaesthetic, it may be necessary 
to stop using Trydonis at least 12 hours before the anaesthesia. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are being, or have ever been, treated for tuberculosis (TB) or if you have a chest 
infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have difficulty passing urine.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have an infection of the mouth or throat. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor before you use Trydonis.<br />
If you have or have had any medical problems or any allergies or if you are not sure if you can use 
Trydonis, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using the inhaler.  </p>
<p>If you are already using Trydonis  </p>
<p>If you are using Trydonis or high doses of other inhaled corticosteroids over long periods and you 
come into a situation of stress (e.g. being taken to hospital after an accident, having a serious injury or 
before an operation) you may need more of this medicine. In such a situation, your doctor may need to 
increase your dose of corticosteroids to cope with the stress and may prescribe them as tablets or 
injections. 
Contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Trydonis 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines similar to Trydonis used for your lung disease.  </p>
<p>Some medicines may increase the effects of Trydonis and your doctor may wish to monitor you 
carefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat). </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine with a beta-blocker medicine (used for treating certain heart problems 
such as angina or for reducing blood pressure) unless your doctor has chosen a beta-blocker that does 
not affect your breathing. Beta-blockers (including beta-blocker eye-drops) may reduce the effects of 
formoterol or make it not work at all. On the other hand, using other beta2-agonist medicines (which 
work in the same way as formoterol) may increase the effects of formoterol. </p>
<p>Using Trydonis together with:  </p>
<ul>
<li>medicines for treating  </li>
<li>abnormal heart rhythms (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide),  </li>
<li>allergic reactions (antihistamines),  </li>
<li>
<p>symptoms of depression or mental disorders such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (for 
example phenelzine and isocarboxazid), tricyclic antidepressants (for example amitriptyline 
and imipramine), phenothiazines<br />
can cause some changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG, heart trace). They may also increase 
the risk of disturbances of heart rhythm (ventricular arrhythmias). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicines for treating Parkinson s disease (levodopa), to treat an underactive thyroid gland 
(levothyroxine), medicines containing oxytocin (which causes uterine contraction) and alcohol 
can increase the chances of formoterol side effects on the heart. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including medicines with similar properties like 
furazolidone and procarbazine, used to treat mental disorders, can cause a rise in blood pressure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicines for treating heart disease (digoxin) can cause a fall in your blood potassium level. 
This may increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other medicines used to treat COPD (theophylline, aminophylline or corticosteroids) and 
diuretics may also cause a fall in your potassium level.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some anaesthetics can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disulfiram, a medicine used in the treatment of people with alcoholism (drinking problems) or 
metronidazole, an antibiotic to treat infection in your body can cause side effects (e.g. feeling 
sick, being sick, stomach pain) due to the small amount of alcohol in Trydonis. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>You should only use Trydonis during pregnancy if you are advised to do so by your doctor. It is 
preferable to avoid the use of Trydonis during labour due to the inhibitory effects of formoterol on 
uterine contractions. 
You should not use Trydonis during breast-feeding. You and your doctor must make a decision 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Trydonis therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for your child and the benefit of therapy for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Trydonis is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Trydonis contains ethanol 
Trydonis contains 8.856 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each actuation, which is equivalent to 17.712 mg 
per dose of two actuations. The amount in two actuations of this medicine is equivalent to less than 
1 ml of wine or beer. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable 
effects. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose is two puffs in the morning and two puffs in the evening.  </p>
<p>If you feel that the medicine is not very effective, talk to your doctor. 
If you have been using a different inhaler containing beclometasone dipropionate previously, ask your 
doctor for advice, as the effective dose of beclometasone dipropionate in Trydonis for the treatment of 
COPD may be lower than that of some other inhalers.  </p>
<p>Route of administration 
Trydonis is for inhalation use. 
You should inhale the medicine through your mouth and this takes the medicine directly into your 
lungs. </p>
<p>This medicine is contained in a pressurised container in a plastic inhaler with a mouthpiece.  </p>
<p>Trydonis is available in three container sizes:<br />
* a container providing 60 puffs 
* a container providing 120 puffs 
* a container providing 180 puffs. </p>
<p>If you have been prescribed a container providing 60 puffs or 120 puffs 
There is a counter on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. Each time you 
press the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the counter will count down by one. 
Take care not to drop the inhaler as this may cause the counter to count down. </p>
<p>If you have been prescribed a container providing 180 puffs 
There is an indicator on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. Each time 
you press the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the dose indicator rotates by a </p>
<p>small amount. The number of puffs remaining is displayed in intervals of 20. Take care not to drop the 
inhaler as this may cause the dose indicator to count down. </p>
<p>Testing your inhaler 
Before using the inhaler for the first time, you should test your inhaler to make sure that it is working 
properly, as follows.<br />
1. Depending on the container size prescribed to you, check that the dose counter reads 61 or and that the dose indicator reads 2. Remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece 
3. Hold your inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom<br />
4. Direct the mouthpiece away from yourself and firmly press the pressurised container to release 
one puff 
5. Check the dose counter or dose indicator. If you are testing your inhaler for the first time, the 
counter should read:</p>
<ul>
<li>when using the container 
providing 60 puffs </li>
<li>when using the container 
providing 120 puffs </li>
<li>when using the container 
providing 180 puffs </li>
</ul>
<p>How to use your inhaler 
Stand or sit up when inhaling.<br />
IMPORTANT: Do not perform steps 2 to 5 too quickly.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece and check that the mouthpiece is clean and free 
from dust and dirt. </li>
<li>Breathe out as slowly and deeply as possible, in order to empty your lungs. </li>
<li>Hold the inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom and place the mouthpiece between 
your teeth without biting it. Then place your lips around the mouthpiece, with the tongue flat 
under it. </li>
<li>Breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth to fill your lungs with air (this should take 
about 4 5 seconds). Just after starting to breathe in, press down firmly on the top of the 
pressurised container to release one puff.  </li>
<li>Hold your breath for as long as possible and, finally, remove the inhaler from your mouth and 
breathe out slowly. Do not breathe out into the inhaler. </li>
<li>Check that the dose counter (60/120 puffs) has moved down by one or that the dose indicator 
(180 puffs) has rotated by a small amount. </li>
</ol>
<p>For the second puff, keep the inhaler in the upright position for about half a minute, then repeat steps 2 
to 5. If you see 'mist' coming from the top of the inhaler or the sides of your mouth, this means that 
Trydonis will not be getting into your lungs as it should. Take another puff, following the instructions 
starting again from step 2. After use, replace the protective cap. </p>
<p>To prevent a fungal infection in the mouth and throat, rinse your mouth or gargle with water without 
swallowing it or brush your teeth after each use of your inhaler. </p>
<p>When to get a new inhaler 
You should get a replacement when the counter or indicator shows the number 20. Stop using the 
inhaler when the counter or indicator shows 0, as any medicine left in the inhaler may not be enough 
to give you a full puff. </p>
<p>If you have a weak grip, it may be easier to hold the inhaler with both hands: hold the upper part of the 
inhaler with both index fingers and its lower part with both thumbs. </p>
<p>If you find it difficult to use the inhaler while starting to breathe in, you may use the AeroChamber 
Plus spacer device. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about this device. 
It is important that you read the package leaflet which is supplied with your AeroChamber Plus spacer 
device and that you carefully follow the instructions on how to use the AeroChamber Plus spacer 
device and how to clean it. </p>
<p>Cleaning of the Trydonis inhaler 
You should clean your inhaler once a week.<br />
1. Do not remove the pressurised container from the inhaler and do not use water or other liquids to 
clean your inhaler. 
2. Remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece by pulling it away from your inhaler. 
3. Wipe inside and outside of the mouthpiece and the inhaler with a clean, dry cloth or tissue. 
4. Replace the mouthpiece cap. </p>
<p>If you use more Trydonis than you should 
It is important that you take your dose as advised by your doctor. Do not exceed your prescribed dose 
without talking to your doctor. 
If you use more Trydonis than you should, side effects, as described in section 4, may occur.<br />
Tell your doctor if you have used more Trydonis than you should and if you experience any of these 
symptoms. Your doctor may wish to carry out some blood tests. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Trydonis 
Use it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the dose you have 
missed, but just take the next dose at the correct time. Do not double the dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Trydonis 
It is important to use Trydonis every day. Do not stop using Trydonis or lower the dose, even if you are 
feeling better or you have no symptoms. If you want to do this, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
