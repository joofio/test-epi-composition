diseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own 
protection (antibodies) against these diseases. </p>
<p>Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver.  This disease is caused 
by the hepatitis A virus.  The hepatitis A virus can be passed from person to person in food and 
drink, or by swimming in water contaminated by sewage.  Symptoms of hepatitis A begin 3 to 6 
weeks after coming into contact with the virus.  These consist of nausea (feeling sick), fever and 
aches and pains.  After a few days the whites of eyes and skin may become yellowish (jaundice).<br />
The severity and type of symptoms can vary.  Young children may not develop jaundice.  Most 
people recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to keep people ill for about a 
month. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become swollen 
(inflamed).  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva 
(spit) of infected people. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine 
are infectious.  </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </li>
<li>neomycin. 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the 
face or tongue. </li>
<li>you have previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against hepatitis A and hepatitis B 
diseases. </li>
<li>you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 C).  A minor infection such as a 
cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving Twinrix Adult if </li>
<li>you have experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine. </li>
<li>you have a poor immune system due to illness or drug treatment. </li>
<li>you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>A poor response to the vaccine, possibly without achieving protection against hepatitis A, has been 
observed in obese people. A poor response to the vaccine, possibly without achieving protection 
against hepatitis B, has also been observed in older people, men rather than women, smokers, obese 
people, and people with long standing illnesses, or people on some type of drug treatments. Your 
doctor may advise you to have a blood test after you have completed the course of vaccinations to 
check if you have made a satisfactory response. If not, your doctor will advise you on the possible 
need to have extra doses. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Twinrix Adult<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. It is not known if Twinrix 
Adult passes into breast milk, however the vaccine is not expected to cause problems in breast-fed 
babies. </p>
<p>Twinrix Adult contains neomycin and sodium 
Please tell your doctor if you have had an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic). 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

protected against the diseases. </p>
<p>The doctor will give Twinrix Adult as an injection into your upper arm muscle.   </p>
<p>The vaccine should not be given (deep) into the skin or intramuscularly into the buttock because 
protection may be less. </p>

<p>Very rare (These may occur in up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine):<br />
Side effects occurred very rarely during clinical studies or routine use of the vaccine or with individual 
hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines include: reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of 
bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia), purple or red brown spots visible through the skin 
(thrombocytopenic purpura), swelling or infection of the brain (encephalitis), degenerative disease of 
the brain (encephalopathy), inflammation of nerves (neuritis), numbness or weakness of the arms and 
legs (neuropathy), paralysis, fits or seizures, swelling of the face, mouth or throat (angioneurotic 
oedema), purple or reddish-purple bumps on the skin (lichen planus), serious skin rashes (erythema 
multiforme), hives, joint swelling, muscular weakness, infection around the brain which may give 
severe headache with stiff neck and sensitivity to light (meningitis), inflammation of some blood 
vessels (vasculitis), abnormal laboratory liver test results, multiple sclerosis, swelling of the spinal 
cord (myelitis), drooping eyelid and sagging muscles on one side of the face (facial palsy), a 
temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness and paralysis in the extremities and 
often progressing to the chest and face (Guillain-Barr  syndrome), a disease of the nerves of the eye 
(optic neuritis), immediate injection site pain, stinging and burning feeling.<br />
Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions and mimicking serum sickness) may 
also occur very rarely (with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine). 
Signs of serious allergic reactions may be rashes that may be itchy or blistering, swelling of the eyes 
and face, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of 
consciousness. Such reactions may occur before leaving the doctor s surgery. However, if you get any 
of these symptoms you should contact a doctor urgently. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />

not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of
