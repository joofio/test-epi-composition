  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Twynsta tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these 
substances help to control your high blood pressure:</p>
<p>Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called  angiotensin-II receptor blockers .
Angiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus 
increasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.</p>
<p>Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called  calcium channel blockers . Amlodipine stops
calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening.
This means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels tightening. 
As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.
Twynsta is used to treat high blood pressure</p>
<p>in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine alone.</p>
<p>in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who
wish to take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience.
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at 
risk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually 
no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure 
blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel 
blocker).</p>
<p>if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Twynsta in early pregnancy   see 
Pregnancy section.)</p>
<p>if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from 
the liver and gall bladder).</p>
<p>if you have narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition 
where your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). </p>
<p>if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack.</p>
<p>if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Twynsta.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Twynsta if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the 
following conditions or illnesses:</p>
<p>Kidney disease or kidney transplant.</p>
<p>Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis).</p>
<p>Liver disease.</p>
<p>Heart trouble.</p>
<p>Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance 
of various blood minerals).</p>
<p>Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body 
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ( water tablets ), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or 
vomiting.</p>
<p>Elevated potassium levels in your blood.</p>
<p>Diabetes.</p>
<p>Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis).</p>
<p>Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris).</p>
<p>A heart attack within the last four weeks.
Talk to your doctor before taking Twynsta:</p>
<p>if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-
related kidney problems.</li>
<li>aliskiren.
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also  Do not take Twynsta .</li>
</ul>
<p>if you are elderly and your dose needs to be increased.
In case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Twynsta.
Children and adolescents
Twynsta is not recommended in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and Twynsta
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some 
cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed 
below:</p>
<p>Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression.</p>
<p>Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, 
potassium-sparing diuretics (certain  water tablets ).</p>
<p>Angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p>
<p>ACE-inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take Twynsta  and 
 Warnings and precautions ).</p>
<p>NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), 
heparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim.</p>
<p>Rifampicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin (antibiotics).</p>
<p>St. John s wort.</p>
<p>Dantrolene (infusion for severe body temperature abnormalities).</p>
<p>Medicines used to alter the way your immune system works (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus and 
everolimus).</p>
<p>Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. 
ketoconazole).</p>
<p>Diltiazem (cardiac medicine).</p>
<p>Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol.</p>
<p>Digoxin.
As with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Twynsta may be reduced when you take 
NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or 
corticosteroids.
Twynsta may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood 
pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, neuroleptics or 
antidepressants).
Twynsta with food and drink
Low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up.
Grapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Twynsta. This is because 
grapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine in 
some patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Twynsta.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Pregnancy
You must tell your doctor if you think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor 
will normally advise you to stop taking Twynsta before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you 
are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Twynsta. Twynsta is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Amlodipine has been shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts.
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Twynsta is not recommended 
for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to 
breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
Some people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of spinning 
(vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, do not drive 
or use machines.
Twynsta contains sorbitol 
This medicine contains 168.64 mg sorbitol in each tablet.
Twynsta contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .</p>         </div>"""

impression that the effect of Twynsta is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
