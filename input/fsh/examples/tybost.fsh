<p>Tybost is used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, the virus that 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  It is used in HIV-1 infected adults and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older: 
* weighing at least 35 kg (when co-administered with atazanavir 300 mg) or 
* weighing at least 40 kg (when co-administered with darunavir 800 mg). </p>
<p>Tybost acts as a booster (enhancer) of atazanavir or darunavir (both protease inhibitors) to improve 
their effect (see section 3 of this leaflet). </p>
<p>Tybost does not directly treat your HIV, but boosts the levels of atazanavir and darunavir in the 
blood.  It does this by slowing down the breakdown of atazanavir and darunavir which will make them 
stay in the body for longer. </p>         </div>"""
