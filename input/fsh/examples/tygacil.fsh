section 6). If you are allergic to tetracycline class antibiotics (e.g., minocycline, doxycycline, 
etc.), you may be allergic to tigecycline.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Tygacil:</p>
<p>If you have poor or slow wound healing.</p>
<p>If you are suffering from diarrhoea before you are given Tygacil. If you develop diarrhoea 
during or after your treatment, tell your doctor at once. Do not take any diarrhoea medicine 
without first checking with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have or previously had any side effects due to antibiotics belonging to the tetracycline 
class (e.g., skin sensitization to sun light, staining on developing teeth, pancreas inflammation, 
and alteration of certain laboratory values aimed at measuring how well your blood clots).</p>
<p>If you have, or previously had liver problems. Depending on the condition of your liver, your 
doctor may reduce the dose to avoid potential side effects.</p>
<p>If you have blockage of the bile ducts (cholestasis).</p>
<p>If you suffer from a bleeding disorder or are in treatment with anticoagulant drugs, as this
medicine can interfere with blood coagulation.
During treatment with Tygacil:</p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you develop severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. 
These may be symptoms of acute pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas which may result in severe 
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting).</p>
<p>In certain serious infections, your doctor may consider to use Tygacil in combination with other 
antibiotics.</p>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you closely for the development of any other bacterial infections. If 
you develop another bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe a different antibiotic specific 
for the type of infection present.</p>
<p>Although antibiotics including Tygacil fight certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may 
continue to grow. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any 
potential infections and treat you if necessary.
Children
Tygacil is not to be used in children less than 8 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and 
efficacy in this age group and because it may induce permanent dental defects such as staining on the 
developing teeth.
Other medicines and Tygacil
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Tygacil may prolong certain tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. It is important that you 
tell your doctor if you are taking medicines to avoid an excess of blood clotting (named 
anticoagulants). If this were the case, your doctor will monitor you closely.
Tygacil may interfere with the contraceptive pill (birth control pill). Talk to your doctor about the need 
for an additional method of contraception while receiving Tygacil.
Tygacil may increase the effect of medicines used to suppress the immune system (such as tacrolimus 
or cyclosporine). It is important that you tell your doctor if you are taking these medicines so you can 
be closely monitored.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tygacil may cause foetal harm. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or 
are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before receiving Tygacil.
It is not known if Tygacil passes into breast milk in humans. Ask your doctor for advice before 
breast-feeding your baby.
Driving and using machines
Tygacil may cause side effects such as dizziness. This may impair your ability to drive or operate 
machinery.
Tygacil contains sodium
Tygacil contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml of solution, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Instructions for use and handling (see also 3. How Tygacil is given in this leaflet)
The powder should be reconstituted with 5.3 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for 
injection, dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection, or Lactated Ringer s solution for injection to 
achieve a concentration of 10 mg/ml of tigecycline. The vial should be gently swirled until the active 
substance is dissolved. Thereafter, 5 ml of the reconstituted solution should be immediately withdrawn 
from the vial and added to a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other suitable infusion container 
(e.g. glass bottle).
For a 100 mg dose, reconstitute using two vials into a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other 
suitable infusion container (e.g. glass bottle).
Note: The vial contains a 6 % overage. Thus, 5 ml of reconstituted solution is equivalent to 50 mg of 
the active substance. The reconstituted solution should be yellow to orange in colour; if not, the 
solution should be discarded. Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
and discolouration (e.g. green or black) prior to administration.
Tigecycline should be administered intravenously through a dedicated line or through a Y-site. If the 
same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several active substances, the line should be 
flushed before and after infusion of tigecycline with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution 
for injection or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection. Injection should be made with an 
infusion solution compatible with tigecycline and any other medicinal product(s) via this common 
line.
Compatible intravenous solutions include: sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, 
dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection, and Lactated Ringer s solution for injection.
When administered through a Y-site, compatibility of tigecycline diluted in sodium chloride 0.9 % for 
injection is demonstrated with the following medicinal products or diluents: amikacin, dobutamine, 
dopamine HCl, gentamicin, haloperidol, Lactated Ringer s, lidocaine HCl, metoclopramide, morphine, 
norepinephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam (EDTA formulation), potassium chloride, propofol, ranitidine 
HCl, theophylline, and tobramycin.
Tygacil must not be mixed with other medicinal products for which compatibility data are not 
available.
Once reconstituted and diluted in the bag or other suitable infusion container (e.g. glass bottle) 
tigecycline should be used immediately.
For single use only, any unused solution should be discarded.</p>         </div>"""
