monoclonal antibodies. It is a protein that targets antibody-producing cells in the immune system (the 
body s natural defences) called B-cells. 
Uplizna is used to reduce the risk of attacks in adults with a rare condition called neuromyelitis optic 
spectrum disorder (NMOSD), which affects the nerves of the eye and spinal cord. The condition is 
thought to be due to the immune system mistakenly attacking the nerves in the body. Uplizna is given 
to patients with NMOSD whose B cells produce antibodies against aquaporin-4, a protein that plays an 
important role in nerve function.  </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to inebilizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you are suffering from a severe active infection such as hepatitis B. </li>

<li>if you have cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Uplizna if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have or think you have an infection. </li>
<li>have ever taken, take, or plan to take medicines that affect your immune system, or other 
treatments for NMOSD. These medicines could increase your risk of getting an infection. </li>
<li>
<p>have ever had hepatitis B or are a calirrier of the hepatitis B virus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have had a recent vaccination or are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. You should receive 
any required vaccines at least 4 weeks before you start treatment with Uplizna. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Infusion-related reactions 
Uplizna can cause infusion-related reactions, which can include headache, feeling sick (nausea), 
sleepiness, shortness of breath, fever, muscle pain, rash, or other symptoms. Treatment may be 
interrupted or stopped if symptoms occur. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents because it has not been studied in this 
population. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Uplizna 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Uplizna should not be used during pregnancy as the medicine may pass the placenta and affect the 
baby. If you are able to get pregnant you should use birth control (contraception) continuously once 
you start receiving Uplizna. If your doctor recommends stopping treatment, continue your 
contraception until 6 months after your last infusion.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if Uplizna passes into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, talk to your healthcare 
provider about the best way to feed your baby if you start treatment with Uplizna. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Uplizna is not expected to impact your ability to drive or use machines.  </p>
<p>Uplizna contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains 48 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion. This is 
equivalent to 2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  </p>         </div>"""
