  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Vaborem is 
Vaborem is an antibiotic medicine that contains two active substances: meropenem and vaborbactam. 
* Meropenem belongs to group of antibiotics called  carbapenems . It can kill many types of bacteria 
by preventing them from building the protective walls that surround their cells. 
* Vaborbactam is a  beta lactamase inhibitor . It blocks the action of an enzyme that allows some 
bacteria to resist the action of meropenem. This helps meropenem kill some bacteria that it cannot 
kill on its own.   </p>
<p>What Vaborem is used for 
Vaborem is used in adults to treat certain serious bacterial infections: 
* of the bladder or kidneys (urinary tract infections) 
* of the stomach and gut (intra-abdominal infections) 
* of the lungs (pneumonia) </p>
<p>It is also used to treat infections 
* of the blood associated with any of the infections mentioned above 
* caused by bacteria that other antibiotics may not be able to kill </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You must not be given Vaborem if 
* you are allergic to meropenem, vaborbactam or the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* you are allergic to other carbapenem antibiotics (the group to which meropenem belongs). 
* you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to related antibiotics belonging to the beta-lactam group 
(including penicillins, cephalosporins or monobactams).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Vaborem if: 
* you have ever had any allergic reaction to other antibiotics belonging to the beta-lactam group 
(including carbapenems, penicillins, cephalosporins, or monobactams) 
* you have ever developed severe diarrhoea during or after antibiotic treatment 
* you have ever suffered from seizures </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before using Vaborem. </p>
<p>You may develop signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions (see section 4). If this happens talk to your 
doctor or nurse immediately so that they can treat the symptoms. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment. </p>
<p>This medicine can affect your liver. Your doctor may take some blood to check how well your liver is 
working while taking the medicine. </p>
<p>New infection 
Although Vaborem can fight certain bacteria, there is a possibility that you may get a different infection 
caused by another organism during or after your treatment. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any 
new infections and give you another treatment if necessary. </p>
<p>Blood tests 
Tell your doctor that you are taking Vaborem if you are going to have any blood tests. This is because you 
may get an abnormal result with something called a  Coombs test . This test looks for the presence of 
antibodies that can destroy red blood cells or may be affected by the response of your immune system to 
Vaborem. </p>
<p>Children or adolescents 
Vaborem should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known if the medicine is safe to use in these age groups. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vaborem 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>It is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* medicines used to treat epilepsy called valproic acid, sodium valproate or valpromide because 
Vaborem may decrease their effect<br />
<em> a medicine for gout called probenecid 
* oral anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin (used to treat or prevent blood clots) 
* hormonal oral contraceptives containing oestrogen and/or progesterone because Vaborem may 
decrease their effect. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use alternative effective 
contraceptive methods during treatment with Vaborem and for a period of 28 days after 
discontinuation of treatment.<br />
</em> medicines predominantly metabolised by CYP1A2 (e.g theophylline), CYP3A4 (e.g alprazolam, 
midazolam, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine, simvastatin, omeprazole, nifedipine, quinidine and 
ethinylestradiol) and/or CYP2C (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin) and/or transported by P-gp (e.g. 
dabigatran, digoxin) because Vaborem may decrease their effect.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor before using Vaborem if any of the above apply to you. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice 
before receiving this medicine. 
As a precautionary measure, you should not be given this medicine during pregancy. </p>
<p>It is important that you tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you intend to breast-feed before 
receiving Vaborem. Small amounts of this medicine may pass into the breast milk and it may affect the 
baby. Therefore, you must discontinue breastfeeding before you are given Vaborem. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Vaborem may make you feel dizzy, sleepy and sluggish, give you a headache or tingling sensation (like 
 pins and needles ) or, in rare cases, cause a fit or seizure. This may affect your ability to drive, use tools 
or machines.  </p>
<p>Vaborem contains sodium 
This medicine contains 250 mg of sodium (main component of cooking salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 12,5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium salt for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. </p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Vaborem is intended for intravenous (IV) administration, only after reconstitution and dilution. 
Standard aseptic techniques must be used for solution preparation and administration. </p>
<p>The number of vials used for a single dose will depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) of the patient.  </p>
<p>Reconstitution:<br />
20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline) should be withdrawn from 
a 250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection for each vial and 
reconstituted with the appropriate number of vials of meropenem/vaborbactam for the corresponding 
Vaborem dosage:  </p>
<p>Reconstitute 2 vials for the Vaborem 2 g/2 g dose 
  Reconstitute 1 vial for the Vaborem 1 g/1 g and Vaborem 0.5 g/0.5 g doses </p>
<p>After mixing gently to dissolve, the reconstituted meropenem/vaborbactam solution will have an 
approximate meropenem concentration of 0.05 g/ml and an approximate vaborbactam concentration of 
0.05 g/ml. The final volume is approximately 21.3 ml. The reconstituted solution is not for direct 
injection. The reconstituted solution must be diluted before intravenous infusion. </p>
<p>Dilution:<br />
To prepare the Vaborem 2 g/2 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of two vials, 
the entire reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from each of the two vials and added back into 
the 250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The 
final infusion concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be about 8 mg/ml each. </p>
<p>To prepare the Vaborem 1 g/1 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of one vial, the 
entire reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from the vial and added back into the 250 ml 
infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The final infusion 
concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be about 4 mg/ml each. </p>
<p>To prepare the Vaborem 0.5 g/0.5 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of one vial, 
10.5 ml of the reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from the vial and added back into the 
250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The final 
infusion concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be 2 mg/ml each. </p>
<p>The diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter. The colour of the diluted solution 
is clear to light yellow.  </p>
<p>Following dilution, the infusion should be completed within 4 hours when stored at 25  C, or within 
22 hours when refrigerated at 2   8  C. </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately upon 
reconstitution and dilution. </p>
<p>Vaborem is not chemically compatible with glucose-containing solutions. This medicinal product must not 
be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6 of the SmPC. </p>         </div>"""
