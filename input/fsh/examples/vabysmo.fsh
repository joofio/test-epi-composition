<p>Vabysmo contains the active substance faricimab, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents.  </p>
<p>Vabysmo is injected into the eye by your doctor to treat eye disorders in adults called:<br />
* neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), 
* visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME). </p>
<p>These disorders affect the macula, the central part of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of 
the eye) that is responsible for fine, central vision. nAMD is caused by the growth of abnormal blood 
vessels which leak blood and fluid into the macula, and DME is caused by leaky blood vessels that 
cause swelling of the macula. </p>
<p>How Vabysmo works </p>
<p>Vabysmo specifically recognises and blocks the activity of proteins known as angiopoietin-2 and 
vascular endothelial growth factor A. When these proteins are present at higher levels than normal, 
they can cause growth of abnormal blood vessels and/or damage to normal vessels, with leakage into 
the macula, causing swelling or damage that can negatively affect a person s vision. By attaching to 
these proteins, Vabysmo can block their actions and prevent abnormal vessel growth, leakage and 
swelling. Vabysmo may improve the disease and/or slow down worsening of the disease and thereby 
maintain, or even improve, your vision. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You should not receive Vabysmo: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to faricimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye. </li>
<li>if you have pain or redness in your eye (eye inflammation). </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. You should not be given Vabysmo. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before receiving Vabysmo: 
* if you have glaucoma (an eye condition usually caused by high pressure in the eye). 
* if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters (dark floating spots) and if you have a 
sudden increase in the size and number of floaters. 
* if you have had eye surgery in the last four weeks or if eye surgery is planned in the next four 
weeks. 
* if you have ever had any eye diseases or eye treatments. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you: 
* develop sudden vision loss. 
* develop signs of a possible eye infection or inflammation, such as increased redness of the eye, 
eye pain, increased eye discomfort, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small 
particles in your vision, increased sensitivity to light. </p>
<p>Furthermore it is important for you to know that: 
* the safety and efficacy of Vabysmo when administered to both eyes at the same time has not 
been studied and use in this way may lead to an increased risk of side effects. 
* injections with Vabysmo may cause a temporary increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) 
in some patients within 60 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each 
injection. 
* your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a 
tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Vabysmo must be given with 
caution. </p>
<p>When some medicines that work in a similar way to Vabysmo are given, there is known to be a risk of 
blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events), which may lead to heart attack or 
stroke. As small amounts of the medicine enter the blood, there is a theoretical risk of such events 
following injection of Vabysmo into the eye. </p>
<p>There is only limited experience in the treatment of:<br />
* patients with active infections. 
* patients with nAMD 85 years or older. 
* patients with DME due to type I diabetes. 
* diabetics with high average blood sugar values (Hb1Ac over 10%). 
* diabetics with an eye disease caused by diabetes called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
* diabetics with high blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg and disease of the blood vessels. 
* patients with DME receiving injections less than every 8 weeks over a long period of time. </p>
<p>There is only limited experience in the treatment of patients receiving injections less than every 8 
weeks over a long period of time, and these patients may be at greater risk of side effects. </p>
<p>There is no experience in the treatment of: 
* diabetics with uncontrolled high blood pressure. 
If any of the above applies to you, your doctor will consider this lack of information when treating you 
with Vabysmo. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>The use of Vabysmo in children and adolescents has not been studied because nAMD and DME occur 
mainly in adults.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vabysmo </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Vabysmo has not been studied in pregnant women. Vabysmo should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before this medicine is given to you. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Vabysmo because it is not known whether 
Vabysmo passes into human milk. </p>
<p>Women who could become pregnant must use an effective method of birth control during treatment 
and for at least three months after stopping treatment with Vabysmo. If you become pregnant or think 
you are pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor right away.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>After your injection with Vabysmo, you may have temporary vision problems (for example blurred 
vision). Do not drive or use machines as long as these last. </p>
<p>Vabysmo contains sodium  </p>
<p>The medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Method of administration </p>
<p>Vabysmo is injected into your eye (intravitreal injection) by a doctor experienced in giving eye 
injections.  </p>
<p>Before the injection your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent 
infection. Your doctor will give you an eye drop (local anaesthetic) to numb the eye to reduce or 
prevent pain from the injection.  </p>
<p>How long does Vabysmo treatment last for </p>
<p>This is a long-term treatment, possibly continuing for months or years. Your doctor will regularly 
monitor your condition to check that the treatment is working. Depending on how you respond to the 
treatment with Vabysmo, your doctor may ask you to change to a more or less frequent dose. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Vabysmo </p>
<p>If you miss a dose, schedule a new appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you stop using Vabysmo  </p>
<p>Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. Stopping treatment may increase your risk of vision 
loss and your vision may worsen. </p>
