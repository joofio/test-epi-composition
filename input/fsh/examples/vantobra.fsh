Vantobra contains an antibiotic medicine called tobramycin. It belongs to a class of antibiotic medicines called 
aminoglycosides. </p>
<p>What Vantobra is used for 
Vantobra is used in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6 years and older to treat lung infections caused by 
bacteria named Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </p>
<p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium that frequently infects the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients at some 
time during their lives. If the infection is not properly treated, it continues to damage the lungs, causing further 
problems with breathing. </p>
<p>How Vantobra works 
When you inhale Vantobra, the antibiotic can enter directly into your lungs to fight the bacteria causing the 
infection. It works by disrupting the production of proteins that the bacteria need to build their cell walls. 
This damages the bacteria and eventually kills them. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tobramycin, to any type of aminoglycoside antibiotics, or to any of 
the other ingredients of Vantobra (listed in section 6). 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor before using Vantobra. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor if you have ever had any of the following conditions: </p>
<ul>
<li>hearing problems (including noises in your ears and dizziness); </li>
<li>kidney problems; </li>
<li>chest tightness; </li>
<li>blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up); </li>
<li>muscle weakness that lasts or becomes worse over time, a symptom mostly related to conditions such as 
myasthenia (muscle weakness) or Parkinson s disease. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before using Vantobra. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have problems with your hearing or kidney function, your doctor may take blood samples to monitor 
the amount of Vantobra in your system. </p>
<p>If you or your maternal family members have a mitochondrial mutation disease (a genetic condition) or loss of 
hearing due to antibiotic medicines, you are advised to inform your doctor or pharmacist before you take this 
medicine; certain mitochondrial mutations may increase your risk of hearing loss with this product. Your doctor 
may recommend genetic testing before administration of Vantobra. </p>
<p>Inhaling medicines can cause chest tightness due to narrowing of the airways, and this can happen with 
Vantobra. Your doctor may ask you to use other appropriate medicines to widen the airways before using 
Vantobra. </p>
<p>Strains of Pseudomonas can become resistant to treatment with an antibiotic over time. This means that 
Vantobra may not work as well as it should over time. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about this. </p>
<p>If you are also taking tobramycin or another aminoglycoside antibiotic by injection, it may increase the risk of 
side effects and your doctor will monitor for these as appropriate. </p>
<p>Children<br />
The medicine is not intended for use in children under 6 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vantobra 
Tell your doctor or a pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>You should not take the following medicines while you are using Vantobra: 
* furosemide, a diuretic ( water tablet ); 
* other medicines with diuretic potential such as urea or mannitol; 
* other medicines which may harm your kidneys or hearing:  * amphotericin B, cefalotin, polymyxins (used to treat microbial infections), ciclosporin, tacrolimus 
(used to reduce the activity of immune system). These medicines may harm the kidneys;  * platinum compounds such as carboplatin and cisplatin (used to treat some forms of cancer). These 
medicines may harm the kidneys or hearing. </p>
<p>The following medicines can increase the risks of harmful effects occurring if they are given to you while you 
also take tobramycin or another aminoglycoside antibiotic given by injection: 
* anticholinesterases such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine (used to treat muscle weakness), or botulinum 
toxin. These medicines may cause muscle weakness to appear or become worse. </p>
<p>If you are taking one or more of the above medicines, talk to your doctor before you use Vantobra. </p>
<p>You should not mix or dilute Vantobra with any other medicine in your Tolero nebuliser handset which is 
provided together with Vantobra. 
If you are taking several different treatments for cystic fibrosis, you should take them in the following order: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bronchodilator therapy, such as salbutamol </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chest physiotherapy </p>
</li>
<li>Other inhaled medicines </li>
<li>Vantobra 
Please check this order with your doctor as well. </li>
</ol>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not known whether inhaling this medicine while you are pregnant causes side effects. When they are given 
by injection, tobramycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics can cause harm to an unborn child, such as 
deafness and kidney problems. </p>
<p>If you are breast feeding, you should talk to your doctor before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Vantobra is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>The dose is the same for all persons aged 6 years and older. </li>
<li>Inhale by mouth the full content of one ampoule in the morning, and one ampoule in the evening using the

<li>It is best to have an interval as close as possible to 12 hours between doses, but this interval must be at

If you have questions about how long to use Vantobra, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>

<pre><code>Use Vantobra only with the Tolero nebuliser handset shown in the picture below to make sure you
</code></pre>
<p>inhale the correct dose. Do not use the Tolero nebuliser handset for any other medicine.<br />
    Read the Instructions for Use provided with the handset device before use.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have an eTrack or eBase controller to connect the Tolero nebuliser handset. The 
respective controller can be prescribed by your physician or purchased separately. </li>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. </li>
<li>Remove one ampoule of Vantobra from the aluminium foil sachet just before inhalation.  </li>
<li>Keep the rest of the medicine refrigerated in the original box. </li>
<li>Lay out all the pieces of your Tolero nebuliser handset on a clean, dry paper or cloth towel. Make sure 
the nebuliser handset is on a flat, stable surface. </li>
<li>Assemble the Tolero nebuliser handset as illustrated in the Instructions for Use of the handset device. </li>
<li>Hold the ampoule upright and tap lightly before twisting off the head part to avoid spilling. Empty the 
contents of one ampoule into the medication reservoir of the nebuliser handset. </li>
<li>Begin your treatment sitting in an upright position, in a well ventilated room. Hold the nebuliser 
handset horizontally and breath normally through your mouth. Avoid breathing through your nose. 
Continue to inhale and exhale comfortably until the treatment is finished. When all of the medicine 
has been delivered, you will hear the  treatment complete  tone. </li>
<li>If you need to interrupt your treatment for any reason, press and hold the On/Off button for one full 
second. To re-start the treatment, press and hold the On/Off button again for one full second to resume 
treatment. </li>
<li>The Tolero nebuliser handset must be cleaned and disinfected as described in the instructions for use 
of the device. </li>
<li>Use a new Tolero nebuliser handset for each treatment cycle (28 days on-treatment) as provided with 
the medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use an alternative untested nebuliser system because it may alter the amount of medicine reaching the 
lungs. This in turn may alter how well the medicine works and its safety. </p>
<p>If you use more Vantobra than you should 
If you inhale too much Vantobra you may get a very hoarse voice. Tell your doctor as soon as possible. If 
Vantobra is swallowed, it is unlikely to cause severe problems as tobramycin is poorly absorbed from the 
stomach, but you should still tell your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Vantobra 
If you forget to use Vantobra and there are at least 6 hours to your next dose, use your dose as soon as you 
can. Otherwise, wait for your next dose. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Vantobra 
Do not stop using Vantobra unless your doctor tells you to do so, as your lung infection may not be 
controlled sufficiently and may become worse. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
