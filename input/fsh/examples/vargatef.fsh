growth and spread of the cancer.
This medicine is used in combination with another cancer medicine (docetaxel) to treat a cancer of the 
lung called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is for adult patients whose NSCLC is of a certain 
type ( adenocarcinoma ) and who had already received one treatment with another medicine to treat

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine
-
if you have or had liver problems, if you have or had bleeding problems, particularly recent 
bleeding in the lung 
-
if you have or have had problems with your kidneys or if an increased amount of protein has 
been detected in your urine
-
if you take blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin, phenprocoumon, heparin or 
acetylsalicylic acid) to prevent blood clotting. Treatment with Vargatef may lead to a higher risk 
of bleeding
-
if you have recently had a surgery or plan to have a surgery. Nintedanib may affect the way 
your wounds heal. Therefore treatment with Vargatef will usually be interrupted if you are 
having surgery. Your doctor will decide when to resume your treatment with this medicine
-
if you have cancer that has spread to the brain
-
if you have high blood pressure
-
if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall
Based on this information your doctor may carry out some blood tests, for example to check your liver 
function and to determine how fast your blood can clot. Your doctor will discuss the results of these 
tests with you and decide whether you can be given Vargatef.
Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine
-
if you get diarrhoea. Treatment of diarrhoea at the first signs is important (see section 4)
-
if you vomit or feel sick (nausea)
-
if you have unexplained symptoms such as yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes 
(jaundice), dark or brown (tea coloured) urine, pain on the upper right side of your stomach area 
(abdomen), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, or feeling tired. This could be 
symptoms of serious liver problems
-
if you develop fever, chills, fast breathing or a fast heartbeat. These could be signs of infection 
or infection of the blood (sepsis) (see section 4)
-
if you experience severe pain in your stomach area, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or 
abdominal rigidity or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a hole in the wall of your gut 
( gastrointestinal perforation )
-
if you experience a combination of some or all of the symptoms thereafter: sudden severe 
abdominal pain or cramping, red blood in your stool, diarrhea or constipation, nausea and 
vomiting as these could be symptoms of a bowel inflammation from reduced blood flow 
( ischaemic colitis )
-
if you experience pain, swelling, reddening, warmth of a limb or if you experience chest pain 
and difficulty to breathe as these could be symptoms of a blood clot in one of your veins
-
if you have any major bleeding
-
if you experience chest pressure or pain, typically on the left side of the body, pain in the neck, 
jaw, shoulder or arm, a fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, as this could be 
symptoms of a heart attack
-
if any side effect(s) you may get (see section 4) becomes serious
Children and adolescents
This medicine has not been studied in children or adolescents to treat a cancer of the lung (NSCLC)
and is therefore not to be taken by children and adolescents below the age of 18 years.
Other medicines and Vargatef 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription.
This medicine can interact with certain other medicines. The following medicines may increase the 
blood levels of nintedanib, the active substance of Vargatef, and hence may increase the risk for side 
effects (see section 4):
-
Ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections)
-
Erythromycin (used to treat bacterial infections)
The following medicines may decrease the blood levels of nintedanib and thus may lead to reduction 
of the effectiveness of Vargatef:
-
Rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)
-
Carbamazepine, phenytoin (used to treat seizures)
-
St. John s Wort (a herbal medicine to treat depression)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy
Do not take this medicine during pregnancy, as it can harm your unborn baby and cause birth defects.
Contraception</p>
<p>Women who can become pregnant must use a highly effective method of birth control to prevent 
pregnancy, when they start taking Vargatef, while they are taking Vargatef and for at least 3 
months after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>You should discuss the most appropriate methods of contraception for you with your doctor.</p>
<p>Vomiting and/or diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal conditions can affect the absorption of oral 
hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, and may reduce their effectiveness. 
Therefore, if experiencing these, talk to your doctor to discuss an alternative more appropriate 
method of contraception.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you become pregnant or think you may be 
pregnant during treatment with Vargatef.
Breast-feeding
It is not known if the medicine passes into breast milk and could cause harm to a breast-fed child. 
Therefore, women should not breast-feed during treatment with Vargatef.
Fertility 
The effect of this medicine on human fertility has not been investigated. 
Driving and using machines
Vargatef may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. You should not drive or 
use machines if you feel sick.
Vargatef contains soya
The capsules contain soya lecithin. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist  if you are not sure.
Do not take Vargatef on the same day as your chemotherapy treatment with docetaxel.
Swallow the capsules whole with water and do not chew them. It is recommended to take the capsules 
with food, i.e. during or immediately before or after a meal. 
Do not open or crush the capsule (see section 5).
The recommended dose is four capsules per day (this is a total of 400 mg nintedanib per day). Do not 
take more than this dose.
This daily dose should be split into two doses of two capsules about 12 hours apart, for example two 
capsules in the morning and two capsules in the evening. These two doses should be taken at around 
the same time each day. Taking the medicine this way ensures that a steady amount of nintedanib is 
maintained in the body.
Dose reduction
If you cannot tolerate the recommended dose of 400 mg per day because of side effects (see section 4),
your doctor may reduce the daily dose of Vargatef. Do not reduce the dose or stop the treatment 
yourself without consulting your doctor first.
Your doctor may reduce your recommended dose to 300 mg per day (two capsules of 150 mg). In this 
case your doctor will prescribe Vargatef 150 mg soft capsules for your treatment. 
If necessary, your doctor may further reduce your daily dose to 200 mg per day (two capsules of mg). You will be prescribed the appropriate capsule strength by your doctor if this happens. 
In both cases, you should take one capsule of the appropriate strength twice daily approximately 
12 hours apart with food (for example in the morning and in the evening) at about the same time of the 
day. 
In case your doctor has stopped your chemotherapy with docetaxel you should continue to take 
Vargatef twice daily.
If you take more Vargatef than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
If you forget to take Vargatef
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take your next dose of Vargatef as planned 
at the next scheduled time and at the dose recommended by your doctor or pharmacist.
If you stop taking Vargatef 
Do not stop taking Vargatef without consulting your doctor first. It is important to take this medicine 
every day, as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. If you do not take this medicine as prescribed 
by your doctor, this cancer treatment may not work properly.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
