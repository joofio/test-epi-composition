in section 6). 
- Vedrop must not be used in newborn premature babies. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Vedrop if you have: 
* Problems with your kidney or dehydration. Vedrop should be used with caution and your kidney 
function closely monitored, because polyethylene glycol, part of the active substance tocofersolan, may 
damage your kidneys.<br />
* Problems with your liver. Vedrop should be used with caution and liver functions closely monitored. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vedrop 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:<br />
* Certain medicines to thin the blood (oral anticoagulants such as warfarin). Your doctor will ask you to 
perform blood tests regularly and may adjust their dose to avoid higher risk of bleeding. 
* Fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A, D, E or K) or highly fat-soluble medicines (such as corticoids, 
ciclosporin, tacrolimus, antihistamine). As Vedrop may increase their absorption during digestion, your 
doctor will monitor the treatment effect and adjust the doses if necessary. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
No clinical data are available on exposure to this medicine during pregnancy. Inform your doctor if you are 
pregnant as he/she will decide if the medicine may be used.<br />
There is no data on whether or not this medicine is present in the breast milk. Inform your doctor if you 
want to breast-feed. Your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Vedrop is not likely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>Vedrop contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate 
(E215), which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). </p>
<p>Vedrop contains 0.18 mmoles (4.1 mg) sodium per ml. Speak to your doctor if you are on a controlled 
sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""
