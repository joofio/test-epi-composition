from iron, sugar (sucrose) and starches. </p>
<p>This medicine is used to control high blood phosphate levels (hyperphosphataemia) in: 
* adult patients who undergo haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (procedures to eliminate toxic 
substances from the blood) because of chronic kidney disease; 
* children from 2 years of age and adolescents with chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5 (severe 
decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or on dialysis. </p>
<p>Too much phosphorus in the blood can lead to calcium being deposited in tissues (calcification). This 
can result in stiffening of the blood vessels, making it harder for the blood to be pumped around the 
body. It may also lead to calcium deposits in soft tissues and bone causing effects such as red eyes, 
itchy skin and bone pain. </p>
<p>This medicine works by binding phosphorus from food in your digestive tract (stomach and intestines). 
This reduces the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed into the bloodstream and thus lowers 
phosphorus levels in your blood. </p>         </div>"""
