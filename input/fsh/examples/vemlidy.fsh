<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to tenofovir alafenamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>If this applies to you, do not take Vemlidy and tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take care not to pass on your hepatitis B to other people. You can still infect others when 
taking this medicine. This medicine does not reduce the risk of passing on hepatitis B to others 
through sexual contact or blood contamination. You must continue to take precautions to avoid 
this. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting others.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. Patients with liver disease, who are 
treated for hepatitis B with antiviral medicines, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal 
liver complications. Your doctor may need to carry out blood tests to monitor your liver 
function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown 
problems with your kidneys, before or during treatment. Before starting treatment and 
during treatment with Vemlidy, your doctor may order blood or urine tests to monitor how your 
kidneys work. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you also have hepatitis C or D. This medicine has not been tested on 
patients who have hepatitis C or D as well as hepatitis B. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you also have HIV. If you are not sure whether you have HIV, your 
doctor should offer you HIV testing before you start taking this medicine for hepatitis B. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor before taking Vemlidy. </p>
<p>There is a possibility that you may experience kidney problems when taking Vemlidy over a long 
period of time (see Warnings and precautions). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children who are under 6 years old, or weighing less than 25 kg. It 
has not been tested in children aged less than 6 years old or weighing less than 25 kg. </p>
<p>Bone problems. Loss of bone mass has been reported in some children who received Vemlidy. The 
effects on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in children are uncertain. Your doctor will 
monitor this possible risk. Tell your doctor if any bone pain or fractures occur. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vemlidy </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicine. Vemlidy may interact with other medicines. As a result, the amounts of Vemlidy or other 
medicines in your blood may change. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may 
make any side effects worse. </p>

<p>The recommended dose is one tablet once a day with food. It is best to take Vemlidy with food to get 
the right levels of active substance in your body. Treatment should continue for as long as your doctor 
tells you. Usually this is for at least 6 to 12 months and may be for many years. </p>

to take another tablet if you are sick (vomit) more than 1 hour after taking Vemlidy. 
If you stop taking Vemlidy </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Vemlidy without your doctor s advice. Stopping treatment with Vemlidy may 
cause your hepatitis B to get worse. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, this 
could be life-threatening. If you stop taking this medicine, you will need regular health checks and 
blood tests for several months to check your hepatitis B infection. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you stop taking this medicine for any reason, particularly if you are
