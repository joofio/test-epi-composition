<p>Abemaciclib blocks the effects of proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6. These proteins are 
abnormally active in some cancer cells and make them grow out of control. Blocking the action of 
these proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells, shrink the tumour and delay progression of the 
cancer.  </p>
<p>Verzenios is used to treat certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-)) which have:</p>
<ul>
<li>spread to the lymph nodes of the armpit, with no detectable spread to other parts of the body, 
been surgically removed, and have certain characteristics that increase the risk of the cancer 
returning. Treatment is given in combination with hormonal therapy, such as aromatase 
inhibitors or tamoxifen, to prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery (treatment after 
surgery is called adjuvant therapy) </li>
<li>spread beyond the original tumour and/or to other organs. It is given together with hormonal 
therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant. </li>
