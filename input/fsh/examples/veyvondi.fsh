  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>VEYVONDI contains the active substance vonicog alfa, which is a recombinant human von 
Willebrand factor (rVWF). It behaves in the same way as natural human von Willebrand factor (VWF) 
in the body. VWF is the carrier molecule for coagulation factor VIII and is involved in blood clotting 
making platelets stick to wounds and so helps to form a blood clot. Lack of VWF increases the 
tendency to bleed. </p>
<p>VEYVONDI is used to prevent and treat bleeding episodes, including bleeding during surgery, in adult 
patients (aged 18 years and older) with von Willebrand disease. It is used when treatment with another 
medicine, desmopressin, is not effective or cannot be given. </p>
<p>Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by the lack or an insufficient amount 
of von Willebrand factor. In patients with the disease the blood does not clot normally leading to a 
prolonged bleeding time. Administration of von Willebrand factor (VWF) allows for correction of von 
Willebrand factor deficiency. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to vonicog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins </p>
<p>If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using VEYVONDI.  </p>
<p>There is a  risk that you may experience a hypersensitivity reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) 
to VEYVONDI. Your doctor should inform you about early signs of severe allergic reactions such as 
increased heart rate, rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in 
breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, fast heartbeat, stuffy nose, red eyes,general feeling of 
being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If any of 
these symptoms occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms, 
including difficulty in breathing and dizziness, require prompt emergency treatment. </p>
<p>Patients developing inhibitors 
Inhibitors (antibodies) against the VWF may occur in some patients receiving the medicine.These 
inhibitors, especially at high levels, could cause the treatment to stop working properly. You will be 
monitored carefully for the possibility of having developed these inhibitors. 
- If your bleeding is not controlled with VEYVONDI, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If your plasma VWF or factor VIII fail to reach the expected levels with VEYVONDI based on the test 
results followed by your doctor, or if bleeding is not adequately controlled, it could be due to the 
presence of VWF or factor VIII antibodies. This will be checked by your doctor. You might need a 
higher dose of VEYVONDI, or a higher dose of factor VIII, or even a different medicine to control 
bleedings. Do not increase the total dose of VEYVONDI to control your bleeding without consulting 
your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have previously been treated with plasma-derived VWF concentrates you may have reduced 
response to VEYVONDI due to pre-existing antibodies. Your doctor may adjust the dose according to 
your laboratory results.  </p>
<p>Thrombolism and embolism 
There is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events if you have known clinical or laboratory risk 
factors. Therefore your doctor will monitor you for early signs of thrombosis. </p>
<p>FVIII products may contain varying amounts of VWF. Therefore, any FVIII product that would be 
administered in combination with VEYVONDI should be a pure FVIII product.  </p>
<p>If you previously had problems with blood clots or vessel occlusion (thromboembolic complications), 
tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
VEYVONDI is not approved for use in children or adolescents below 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and VEYVONDI 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
VEYVONDI is not likely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>VEYVONDI contains sodium 
This medicine contains 5.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 650 IU vial or 
10.4 mg sodium in each 1300 IU vial. </p>
<p>This is equivalent to 2.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult, 
assuming 70 kg body weight and 80 IU/kg body weight. </p>
<p>This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

patients with von Willebrand disease.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate your dose of VEYVONDI (in international units or IU). The dose depends 
on:</p>
<ul>
<li>body weight,  </li>
<li>the site of the bleeding </li>
<li>intensity of the bleeding,  </li>
<li>your clinical condition,  </li>
<li>the required surgery  </li>
<li>the VWF activity levels in your blood after surgery  </li>
<li>the severity of your disease </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may test your blood to make sure that you have adequate levels of von Willebrand factor. 
This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding episodes </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate the dose that is most appropriate for you, how often you should receive 
VEYVONDI and for how long.  </p>
<p>For minor bleeding (e.g. nose bleed, oral bleeding, menorrhagia), each initial dose is usually 40 to 
50 IU/kg and for major bleeding (severe or refractory nose bleed, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, Central nervous system trauma, haemarthrosis, or traumatic haemorrhage), each initial dose 
is 50 to 80 IU/kg. Subsequent doses (as clinically required) are 40 to 50 IU/kg every 8 to 24 hours for 
minor bleeds as long as deemed clinically necessary and for major bleeds 40 to 60 IU/kg for 
approximately 2-3 days. </p>
<p>If you feel that VEYVONDI is not working well enough, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will perform 
tests to make sure that you have adequate levels of von Willebrand factor. If you use VEYVONDI at 
home, your doctor will make sure that you are shown how to infuse it and how much to use. </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding in case of elective surgery </p>
<p>For prevention of excessive bleeding your doctor will assess the FVIII:C levels within 3 hours before 
surgery. If your FVIII level is inadequate your doctor may give you a dose of 40-60 IU/kg 
VEYVONDI 12-24 hours (pre-operative dose) prior to initiating elective surgery in order to raise 
FVIII levels to the target level (0.4 IU/mL for minor and at least 0.8 IU/mL for major surgery). Within 
1 hour prior to surgery, you will receive a dose of VEYVONDI based on the assessment 3 hours 
before surgery. The dose depends on VWF and FVIII levels of the patient, the type and severity of the 
expected bleeding. </p>
<p>Prophylaxis treatment </p>
<p>The usual starting dose for long term prophylaxis against bleeding episodes is 40 to 60 IU/kg twice 
weekly. The dose can be adjusted to a maximum of 80 IU/kg one to three times per week, depending 
on your condition and how well VEYVONDI is working for you. Your doctor will calculate the dose 
that is most appropriate for you, how often you should receive VEYVONDI and for how long. </p>
<p>How VEYVONDI is given 
VEYVONDI is usually infused into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. Detailed 
instructions for reconstitution and admnistration are given at the end of this package leaflet. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
VEYVONDI is not approved for use in children and adolescents below 18 years.<br />
If you use more VEYVONDI than you should 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. If you infuse more VEYVONDI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. There 
may be a risk of developing blood clots (thrombosis) in case of an accidental high dose. </p>
<p>If you forget to use VEYVONDI 
- Do not infuse a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.<br />
- Proceed with the next infusion as scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop using VEYVONDI 
Do not stop using VEYVONDI without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
