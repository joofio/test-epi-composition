<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking VFEND if: </p>
<ul>
<li>you have had an allergic reaction to other azoles.  </li>
<li>you are suffering from, or have ever suffered from liver disease. If you have liver disease, your doctor 
may prescribe a lower dose of VFEND. Your doctor should also monitor your liver function while you 
are being treated with VFEND by doing blood tests.  </li>
<li>you are known to have cardiomyopathy, irregular heart beat, slow heart rate or an abnormality of 
electrocardiogram (ECG) called  long QTc syndrome .  </li>
</ul>
<p>You should avoid any sunlight and sun exposure while being treated. It is important to cover sun exposed 
areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF), as an increased sensitivity of skin to 
the sun s UV rays can occur. This may be further increased by other medicines that sensitise the skin to 
sunlight, like methotrexate. These precautions are also applicable to children. </p>
<p>While being treated with VFEND:<br />
* tell your doctor immediately if you develop * sunburn * severe skin rash or blisters  * bone pain  </p>
<p>If you develop skin disorders as described above, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after 
consultation may decide that it is important for you to be seen on a regular basis. There is a small chance that 
skin cancer could develop with long-term use of VFEND.  </p>
<p>If you develop signs of  adrenal insufficiency  where the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of 
certain steroid hormones such as cortisol which may lead to symptoms such as: chronic, or long lasting 
fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If you develop signs of  Cushing s syndrome  where the body produces too much of the hormone cortisol<br />
which may lead to symptoms such as: weight gain, fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, 
darkening of the skin on the stomach, thighs breasts, and arms, thinning skin, bruising easily, high blood 
sugar, excessive hair growth, excessive sweating, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor should monitor the function of your liver and kidney by doing blood tests.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
VFEND should not be given to children younger than 2 years of age.  </p>

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including those that are obtained without a prescription.  </p>

may affect the way they work.   </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking the following medicine, as treatment with VFEND at the same time should 
be avoided if possible:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Ritonavir (used for treating HIV) in doses of 100 mg twice daily </li>
<li>Glasdegib (used for treating cancer)   if you need to use both drugs your doctor will monitor your 
heart rhythm frequently </li>
</ul>

time should be avoided if possible, and a dose adjustment of voriconazole may be required:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Rifabutin (used for treating tuberculosis). If you are already being treated with rifabutin your blood 
counts and side effects to rifabutin will need to be monitored. </li>
<li>Phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). If you are already being treated with phenytoin your blood 
concentration of phenytoin will need to be monitored during your treatment with VFEND and your 
dose may be adjusted. </li>

required to check that the medicines and/ or VFEND are still having the desired effect:  </p>
