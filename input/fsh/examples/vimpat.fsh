Vimpat contains lacosamide. This belongs to a group of medicines called  antiepileptic medicines . 
These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. 
* You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have. </p>
<p>What Vimpat is used for 
* Vimpat is used: </p>
<p>on its own and in association with other antiepileptic medicines in adults, adolescents 
and children aged 2 years and older to treat a certain type of epilepsy characterised by 
the occurrence of partial-onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation. In this 
type of epilepsy, fits first affect only one side of your brain. However, these may then 
spread to larger areas on both sides of your brain; </p>
<p>in association with other antiepileptic medicines in adults, adolescents and children 
aged 4 years and older to treat primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, 
including loss of consciousness) in patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the 
type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Vimpat 
* if you are allergic to lacosamide, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you are not sure whether you are allergic, please discuss with your doctor. 
* if you have a certain type of heart beat problem called second- or third-degree AV block. </p>
<p>Do not take Vimpat if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Vimpat if: 
* you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with 
antiepileptic medicinal products such as lacosamide have had thoughts of harming or killing 
themselves. If you have any of these thoughts at any time, tell your doctor straight away. 
* you have a heart problem that affects the beat of your heart and you often have a particulary 
slow, fast or irregular heart beat (such as AV block, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter).<br />
<em> you have severe heart disease such as heart failure or have had a heart attack.<br />
</em> you are often dizzy or fall over. Vimpat may make you dizzy - this could increase the risk of 
accidental injury or a fall. This means that you should take care until you are used to the 
effects of this medicine. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Vimpat. 
If you are taking Vimpat, talk to your doctor if you are experiencing a new type of seizure or 
worsening of existing seizures. 
If you are taking Vimpat and you are experiencing symptoms of abnormal heartbeat (such as slow, 
rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting), seek 
medical advice immediately (see section 4). </p>
<p>Children<br />
Vimpat is not recommended for children aged under 2 years with epilepsy characterised by the 
occurrence of partial-onset seizure and not recommended for children aged under 4 years with primary 
generalised tonic-clonic seizures. This is because we do not yet know whether it will work and 
whether it is safe for children in this age group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vimpat 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that affect 
your heart - this is because Vimpat can also affect your heart: 
* medicines to treat heart problems;<br />
<em> medicines which can increase the  PR interval  on a scan of the heart (ECG or 
electrocardiogram) such as medicines for epilepsy or pain called carbamazepine, lamotrigine 
or pregabalin;<br />
</em> medicines used to treat certain types of irregular heart beat or heart failure.<br />
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Vimpat.  </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines - this is because 
they may increase or decrease the effect of Vimpat on your body: 
* medicines for fungal infections such as fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole;<br />
<em> medicines for HIV such as ritonavir; 
* medicines used to treat bacterial infections such as clarithromycin or rifampicin;<br />
</em> a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety and depression called St. John s wort. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Vimpat.  </p>
<p>Vimpat with alcohol 
As a safety precaution do not take Vimpat with alcohol. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Fertile women should discuss the use of contraceptives with the doctor. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not recommended to take Vimpat if you are pregnant, as the effects of Vimpat on pregnancy and 
the unborn baby are not known.<br />
It is not recommended to breast-feed your baby while taking Vimpat, as Vimpat passes into breast 
milk. 
Seek advice immediately from your doctor if you get pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. 
They will help you decide if you should take Vimpat or not. </p>
<p>Do not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first as this could increase your fits (seizures). A 
worsening of your disease can also harm your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you know how this medicine affects you. This is 
because Vimpat may make you feel dizzy or cause blurred vision.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Taking Vimpat 
* Take Vimpat twice each day - approximately 12 hours apart. 
* Try to take it at about the same time each day.<br />
* Swallow the Vimpat tablet with a glass of water. 
* You may take Vimpat with or without food. </p>
<p>You will usually start by taking a low dose each day and your doctor will slowly increase this over a 
number of weeks. When you reach the dose that works for you, this is called the  maintenance dose , 
you then take the same amount each day. Vimpat is used as a long term treatment. You should 
continue to take Vimpat until your doctor tells you to stop. </p>
<p>How much to take 
Listed below are the normal recommended doses of Vimpat for different age groups and weights. 
Your doctor may prescribe a different dose if you have problems with your kidneys or with your liver. </p>
<p>Adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more and adults 
When you take Vimpat on its own 
- The usual starting dose of Vimpat is 50 mg twice a day. 
- Your doctor may also prescribe a starting dose of 100 mg of Vimpat twice a day. 
- Your doctor may increase your twice daily dose every week by 50 mg. This will be until 
you reach a maintenance dose between 100 mg and 300 mg twice a day. </p>
<p>When you take Vimpat with other antiepileptic medicines 
- The usual starting dose of Vimpat is 50 mg twice a day.<br />
- Your doctor may increase your twice daily dose every week by 50 mg. This will be until 
you reach a maintenance dose between 100 mg and 200 mg twice a day. 
- If you weigh 50 kg or more, your doctor may decide to start Vimpat treatment with a 
single  loading  dose of 200 mg. You would then start your ongoing maintenance dose 
12 hours later. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg 
- In the treatment of partial-onset seizure: Observe that Vimpat is not recommended for children under 
2 years of age. 
- In the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures: Observe that Vimpat is not 
recommended for children under 4 years of age. </p>
<ul>
<li>The dose depends on their body weight. They usually start treatment with the syrup and only change 
to tablets if they are able to take tablets and get the correct dose with the different tablet strengths. The 
doctor will prescribe the formulation that is best suited to them. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you take more Vimpat than you should<br />
If you have taken more Vimpat than you should, contact your doctor immediately. Do not try to drive. 
You may experience:<br />
<em> dizziness;<br />
</em> feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting);<br />
* fits (seizures), heart beat problems such a slow, fast or irregular heart beat, coma or a fall in 
blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Vimpat<br />
<em> If you have missed a dose within the first 6 hours of the scheduled dose, take it as soon as you 
remember.<br />
</em> If you have missed a dose beyond the first 6 hours of the scheduled dose, do not take the 
missed tablet anymore. Instead take Vimpat at the next time that you would normally take it.<br />
* Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Vimpat 
* Do not stop taking Vimpat without talking to your doctor, as your epilepsy may come back 
again or become worse.<br />
* If your doctor decides to stop your treatment with Vimpat, they will tell you how to decrease 
the dose step by step. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
