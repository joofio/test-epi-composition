you to get an erection if you are sexually stimulated.
Vizarsin is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction, sometimes known as impotence. This 
is when a man cannot get, or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity.</p>         </div>"""

pressure upon sitting or standing up quickly. Certain patients have experienced these symptoms when

your alpha-blocker before you start Vizarsin. Your doctor may start you on a lower dose (25 mg) of 
Vizarsin.
