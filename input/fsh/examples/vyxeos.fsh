Vyxeos liposomal belongs to a group of medicines called  antineoplastics  used in cancer. It contains 
two active substances, called  daunorubicin  and  cytarabine , in the form of tiny particles known as 
 liposomes . 
These active substances act in different ways to kill cancer cells by stopping them from growing and 
dividing. Packaging them in liposomes prolongs their action in the body and helps them to enter and 
kill the cancer cells.  </p>
<p>What Vyxeos liposomal is used for 
Vyxeos liposomal is used to treat patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (a cancer of 
the white blood cells). It is given when the leukaemia was caused by previous treatments (known as 
therapy related acute myeloid leukaemia) or when there are certain changes in the bone marrow 
(known as acute myeloid leukaemia with  myelodysplasia-related changes ). </p>         </div>"""

ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor will monitor you during treatment. Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
Vyxeos liposomal: 
* if you have low numbers of platelets, red or white blood cells in your blood (you will have a 
blood test before starting treatment). If this applies to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>your doctor may also give you a medicine to help stop you getting an infection. </li>
<li>your doctor will also check you for infections during treatment. </li>
<li>if you have ever had a heart problem or heart attack, or you have previously taken 
 anthracycline  cancer medicines. If this applies to you, your doctor may check your heart 
before starting, and during treatment. </li>
<li>if you think you might be pregnant. You should use an effective method of contraception to 
avoid getting (you or your partner) pregnant during the treatment, and for the next 6 months 
after your last dose. </li>
<li>if you have any allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. Your doctor may pause or stop treatment, 
or slow the rate of your drip,  if any hypersensitivity occurs.  </li>
<li>if you have had problems with your kidneys or liver. Your doctor will monitor you during 
treatment. </li>
<li>if you have ever had a condition known as Wilson s disease or other copper-related disorder, as 
Vyxeos liposomal contains an ingredient known as 'copper gluconate'. </li>
<li>if you are to be given a vaccine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you with regards to your general health during treatment and may also give 
you other medicines to support your treatment, either before or with Vyxeos liposomal. If any of the 
above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given 
Vyxeos liposomal. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Vyxeos liposomal is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vyxeos liposomal 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. This is 
because Vyxeos liposomal may affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other 
medicines may affect the way Vyxeos liposomal works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* cancer medicines that can affect your heart, such as doxorubicin. 
* medicines that can affect your liver. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not use Vyxeos liposomal during pregnancy as it may be harmful to the baby. Use an 
effective method of contraception during and for 6 months after treatment. Tell your doctor straight 
away if you become pregnant during treatment.  </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed while you are receiving treatment with Vyxeos liposomal as it may be 
harmful to the baby. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Contraception in males 
Use an effective method of contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with Vyxeos 
liposomal.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may feel sleepy or dizzy after having Vyxeos liposomal. If this happens, do not drive or use any 
tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""
