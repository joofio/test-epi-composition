- if you are allergic to lefamulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) 
- if you are allergic to other medicines from the pleuromutilin class 
- if you are taking certain medicines that might interact with Xenleta. This is because some 
medicines may stop Xenleta working or lead to side effects if they are given with Xenleta. See 
below under Other medicines and Xenleta for examples. 
- if you are taking medicines that can cause changes in the heart s electrical activity seen with an 
ECG (see below under Other medicines and Xenleta). This is because lefamulin can cause a 
condition called QT interval prolongation i.e. abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart s 
rhythm. 
- if you have a salt imbalance in the blood (especially low levels of potassium in the blood) 
- if you have or have had an irregular heart rhythm or an abnormal ECG finding called QT 
prolongation 
- if you have a very slow heart beat (bradycardia) 
- if your heart does not work well enough (heart failure) 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Xenleta 
- if you have kidney failure and require dialysis. 
- if you have cirrhosis (severe liver disease.) </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor before taking Xenleta. </p>
<p>If you develop severe diarrhoea during or after taking Xenleta tablets, talk to your doctor because 
you may need to stop your medicine, or you may need to take another medicine to treat the diarrhoea. 
Antibiotics can lead to excessive growth of certain bacteria in your bowel (gut) that can damage the 
bowel and cause severe diarrhoea. </p>
<p>If you develop yellow skin (jaundice) or the white of your eyes turn yellow (scleral icterus), talk 
to your doctor because you may need to stop taking Xenleta or other medicines. </p>
<p>Other infections 
There is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or 
after treatment with Xenleta. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any new infections and give 
you another treatment if necessary. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Xenleta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xenleta 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, as some of them could affect or be affected by Xenleta. The lists below provide only some 
examples of medicines that should be avoided while taking lefamulin or for which caution is needed. 
Your doctor will a dvise you if lefamulin is suitable for you. </p>
<p>You must not take any of the following medicines with lefamulin:</p>
<ul>
<li>carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone (for epilepsy) </li>
<li>efavirenz, ritonavir- (for HIV) </li>

medicines include: 
* alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam or other drugs called benzodiazepines (for anxiety) 
* alfentanil (an opioid for pain)

* verapamil (for high blood pressure) </p>
<p>Xenleta with food and drink 
Xenleta should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. This is 
because food and some drinks can affect the way medicines work. 
You must not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while on treatment with Xenleta as it might 
interact with Xenleta and increase side effects. </p>

Do not take Xenleta if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think 
you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before

free . </p>         </div>"""

should be swallowed whole with water. </p>
<p>Xenleta tablets may also be taken after starting treatment with Xenleta infusion via an intravenous
