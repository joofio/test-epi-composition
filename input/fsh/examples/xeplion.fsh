  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Xeplion contains the active substance paliperidone which belongs to the class of antipsychotic 
medicines and is used as a maintenance treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia in adult patients 
stabilised on paliperidone or risperidone.
If you have shown responsiveness to paliperidone or risperidone in the past and have mild to moderate 
symptoms your doctor may start treatment with Xeplion without prior stabilisation with paliperidone 
or risperidone.
Schizophrenia is a disease with  positive  and  negative  symptoms. Positive means an excess of 
symptoms that are not normally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may hear voices or 
see things that are not there (called hallucinations), believe things that are not true (called delusions), 
or feel unusually suspicious of others. Negative means a lack of behaviours or feelings that are 
normally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may appear withdrawn and may not 
respond at all emotionally or may have trouble speaking in a clear and logical way. People with this 
disease may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, or tense.
Xeplion can help alleviate the symptoms of your disease and stop your symptoms from coming back.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Xeplion.
This medicine has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. However, elderly patients with 
dementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke 
or death (see section 4, possible side effects).
All medicines have side effects and some of the side effects of this medicine can worsen the symptoms 
of other medical conditions. For that reason, it is important to discuss with your doctor any of the 
following conditions which can potentially worsen during treatment with this medicine:
-
if you have Parkinson s disease
-
if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high temperature 
and muscle stiffness (also known as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome)
-
if you have ever experienced abnormal movements of the tongue or face (Tardive Dyskinesia)
-
if you know that you have had low levels of white blood cells in the past (which may or may not 
have been caused by other medicines)
-
if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes
-
if you have had breast cancer or a tumour in the pituitary gland in your brain
-
if you have a heart disease or heart disease treatment that makes you prone to low blood 
pressure
-
if you have low blood pressure when you stand up or sit up suddenly
-
if you have epilepsy
-
if you have kidney problems
-
if you have liver problems
-
if you have prolonged and/or painful erection
-
if you have problems with controlling core body temperature or overheating
-
if you have an abnormally high level of the hormone prolactin in your blood or if you have a 
possible prolactin-dependent tumour
-
if you or someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been 
associated with formation of blood clots.
If you have any of these conditions, please talk to your doctor as he/she may want to adjust your dose 
or monitor you for a while.
As dangerously low numbers of a certain type of white blood cell needed to fight infection in your 
blood has been seen very rarely with patients taking this medicine, your doctor may check your white 
blood cell counts.
Even if you have previously tolerated oral paliperidone or risperidone, rarely allergic reactions occur 
after receiving injections of Xeplion. Seek medical attention right away if you experience a rash, 
swelling of your throat, itching, or problems breathing as these may be signs of a serious allergic 
reaction.
This medicine may cause you to gain weight. Significant weight gain may adversely affect your 
health. Your doctor should regularly measure your body weight.
As diabetes mellitus or worsening of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been seen with patients taking 
this medicine, your doctor should check for signs of high blood sugar. In patients with pre-existing 
diabetes mellitus blood glucose should be monitored regularly.
Since this medicine may reduce your urge to vomit, there is a chance that it may mask the body s 
normal response to ingestion of toxic substances or other medical conditions.
During an operation on the eye for cloudiness of the lens (cataract), the pupil (the black circle in the 
middle of your eye) may not increase in size as needed. Also, the iris (the coloured part of the eye) 
may become floppy during surgery and that may lead to eye damage. If you are planning to have an 
operation on your eye, make sure you tell your eye doctor that you are taking this medicine.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not for people who are under 18 years old.
Other medicines and Xeplion
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Taking this medicine with carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic and mood stabiliser) may require a change 
to your dose of this medicine.
Since this medicine works primarily in the brain, interference from other medicines that work in the 
brain can cause an exaggeration of side effects such as sleepiness or other effects on the brain such as 
other psychiatric medications, opioids, antihistamines and sleep medication.
Since this medicine can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when this medicine is used with 
other medicines that lower blood pressure.
This medicine can reduce the effect of medicines against Parkinson s disease and restless legs 
syndrome (e.g., levodopa).
This medicine may cause an electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality demonstrating a long time for an 
electrical impulse to travel through a certain part of the heart (known as  QT prolongation ). Other 
medicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat the rhythm of the heart or to treat 
infection, and other antipsychotics.
If you are prone to develop convulsions, this medicine may increase your chance of experiencing 
them. Other medicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat depression or to treat 
infection, and other antipsychotics.
Xeplion should be used with caution with medicines that increase the activity of the central nervous 
system (psychostimulants such as methylphenidate).
Xeplion with alcohol
Alcohol should be avoided.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should not use this medicine 
during pregnancy unless this has been discussed with your doctor. The following symptoms may occur 
in newborn babies of mothers that have used paliperidone in the last trimester (last three months of 
their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, 
and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops any of these symptoms you may need to contact your 
doctor.
This medicine can pass from mother to baby through breast milk and may harm the baby. Therefore, 
you should not breastfeed when using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Dizziness, extreme tiredness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see 
section 4). This should be considered in cases where full alertness is required, e.g., when driving a car 
or handling machines.
Xeplion contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

keep your appointment with the doctor, make sure you call him right away so another appointment can 
be made as soon as possible.
You will receive the first injection (150 mg) and second injection (100 mg) of this medicine in the 
upper arm approximately one week apart. Thereafter, you will receive an injection (ranging from 
25 mg to 150 mg) in either the upper arm or buttocks once a month.
If your doctor is switching you from risperidone long acting injection to this medicine, you will 
receive the first injection of this medicine (ranging from 25 mg to 150 mg) in either the upper arm or 
buttocks on the date that your next injection was scheduled. Thereafter, you will receive an injection 
(ranging from 25 mg to 150 mg) in either the upper arm or buttocks once a month.
Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may increase or decrease the amount of medicine you 
receive by one dose level at the time of your scheduled monthly injection.
Patients with kidney problems
Your doctor may adjust your dose of this medicine based on your kidney function. If you have mild 
kidney problems your doctor may give you a lower dose. If you have moderate or severe kidney 
problems this medicine should not be used.
Elderly
Your doctor may reduce your dose of this medicine if your kidney function is reduced.
If you are given more Xeplion than needed
This medicine will be given to you under medical supervision; it is, therefore, unlikely that you will be 
given too much.
Patients who have been given too much paliperidone may experience the following symptoms:
drowsiness or sedation, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, an abnormal electrocardiogram (electrical 
tracing of the heart), or slow or abnormal movements of the face, body, arms or legs.
If you stop using Xeplion
If you stop receiving your injections, you will lose the effects of the medicine. You should not stop 
using this medicine unless told to do so by your doctor as your symptoms may return.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site:
http://www.ema.europa.eu
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only and should 
be read by the medical or healthcare professional in conjunction with the full prescribing 
information (Summary of Product Characteristics).
The suspension for injection is for single use only. It should be inspected visually for foreign matter 
before administration. Do not use if the syringe is not visually free of foreign matter.
The pack contains a pre-filled syringe and 2 safety needles (a 1 -inch 22 gauge needle [38.1 mm x 
0.72 mm] and a 1-inch 23 gauge needle [25.4 mm x 0.64 mm]) for intramuscular injection. Xeplion is 
also available in a Treatment initiation pack which contains two pre-filled syringes (150 mg + 100 mg)
and 2 additional safety needles.
1. Shake the syringe vigorously for a minimum of 10 seconds to ensure a homogeneous 
suspension.
2. Select the appropriate needle.
The first initiation dose of Xeplion (150 mg) is to be administered on Day 1 in the DELTOID 
muscle using the needle for DELTOID injection. The second initiation dose of Xeplion
(100 mg) is to also be administered in the DELTOID muscle one week later (Day 8) using the 
needle for DELTOID injection.
If the patient is being switched from risperidone long acting injection to Xeplion, the first 
injection of Xeplion (ranging from 25 mg to 150 mg) can be administered in either the 
DELTOID or GLUTEAL muscle using the appropriate needle for the injection site at the time 
of the next scheduled injection.
Thereafter, the monthly maintenance injections can be administered in either the DELTOID or 
GLUTEAL muscle using the appropriate needle for the injection site.
For DELTOID injection, if the patient weighs &lt; 90 kg, use the 1-inch, 23 gauge needle 
(25.4 mm x 0.64 mm) (needle with blue coloured hub); if the patient weighs   90 kg, use the 
1 -inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) (needle with grey coloured hub).
For GLUTEAL injection, use the 1 -inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) (needle with 
grey coloured hub).
3. Hold the syringe with the tip cap pointing up, remove the rubber tip cap with a gentle twisting 
motion.
4. Peel the safety needle blister pouch half way open. Grasp the needle sheath using the plastic 
peel pouch. Hold the syringe pointing up. Attach the safety needle to the syringe using a gentle 
twisting motion to avoid needle hub cracks or damage. Always check for signs of damage or 
leaking prior to administration.
5. Pull the needle sheath away from the needle with a straight pull. Do not twist the sheath as the 
needle may be loosened from the syringe.
6. Bring the syringe with the attached needle in upright position to de-aerate. De-aerate the syringe 
by moving the plunger rod carefully forward.
7. Inject the entire contents intramuscularly slowly, deep into the selected deltoid or gluteal muscle 
of the patient. Do not administer intravascularly or subcutaneously.
8. After the injection is complete, use either thumb or finger of one hand (8a, 8b) or a flat surface 
(8c) to activate the needle protection system. The system is fully activated when a  click  is 
heard. Discard the syringe with needle appropriately.
