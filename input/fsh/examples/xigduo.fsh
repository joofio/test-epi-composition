  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>This medicine contains two different substances called dapagliflozin and metformin. Both belong to a 
group of medicines called oral anti-diabetics. These are medicines taken by mouth for diabetes.
Xigduo is used for a type of diabetes called  type 2 diabetes  in adult patients (aged 18 years and 
older) and usually occurs when you are older. If you have type 2 diabetes, your pancreas does not 
make enough insulin or your body is not able to use the insulin it produces properly. This leads to a 
high level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. </p>
<p>Dapagliflozin works by removing excess sugar from your body via your urine and lowers the 
amount of sugar in your blood. It can also help prevent heart disease.</p>
<p>Metformin works mainly by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.
To treat diabetes:</p>
<p>This medicine is taken in combination with diet and exercise.</p>
<p>This medicine is used if your diabetes cannot be controlled with other medicines used to treat 
diabetes.</p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to take this medicine on its own or together with other medicines to 
treat diabetes. This may be another medicine taken by mouth and/or a medicine given by 
injection, such as insulin or a GLP-1 receptor agonist (helps your body to increase the 
production of insulin when your blood sugar is high).</p>
<p>If you are already taking both dapagliflozin and metformin as single tablets, your doctor may 
ask you to switch to this medicine. To avoid overdose, do not continue taking dapagliflozin and 
metformin tablets, if you are taking Xigduo.
It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example severe hyperglycaemia (high blood

acidosis  below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called  ketone 
bodies  accumulate in the blood and which can lead to a diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell.</p>

section  Xigduo with alcohol ).
Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you.
Warnings and precautions
Risk of lactic acidosis
Xigduo may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your 
kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with 
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further 
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a 
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). 
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Xigduo for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Xigduo and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience 
some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:
-
vomiting
-
stomach ache (abdominal pain)
-
muscle cramps
-
a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness
-
difficulty in breathing
-
reduced body temperature and heartbeat
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xigduo, and during treatment:</p>
<p>if you have  type 1 diabetes    the type that usually starts when you are young, and your body 
does not produce any insulin. Xigduo should not be used to treat this condition.</p>
<p>if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a 
doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic 
ketoacidosis    a rare but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes 
because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of
developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol 
consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to 
major surgery or serious illness.</p>
<p>if you have problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will check your kidney function.</p>
<p>if you have very high levels of glucose in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too 
much body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed in section 4. Tell your doctor before 
you start taking this medicine if you have any of these signs.</p>
<p>if you are taking medicines to lower blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history of 
low blood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below under  Other medicines and 
Xigduo .</p>
<p>if you often get infections of the urinary tract. This medicine may cause urinary tract infections 
and your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. Your doctor may consider temporarily 
changing your treatment if you develop a serious infection.
If you need to have major surgery, you must stop taking Xigduo during and for some time after the 
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Xigduo. 
It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by 
your health care professional.
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking this medicine.
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling 
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening 
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue 
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Kidney function
During treatment with Xigduo, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once every year or 
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Urine glucose
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this 
medicine.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because it has 
not been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Xigduo
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Xigduo before or at the time of the 
injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Xigduo.
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may 
need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may adjust the dosage of 
Xigduo. It is especially important to mention the following:</p>
<p>if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics).</p>
<p>if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or 
a  sulphonylurea  medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, 
to prevent you from getting blood sugar levels that are too low (hypoglycaemia).</p>
<p>if you are taking cimetidine, a medicine used to treat stomach problems.</p>
<p>if you are using bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) which are used to treat asthma.</p>
<p>if you are using corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation in diseases like asthma and arthritis) 
that are given by mouth, as an injection, or inhaled.</p>
<p>if you are using medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, 
such as ibuprofen and celecoxib).</p>
<p>if you are using certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists).
Xigduo with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Xigduo since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis 
(see  Warnings and precautions ).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should stop taking this medicine 
if you become pregnant, since it is not recommended during the second and third trimesters (the last 
six months) of pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while 
you are pregnant.
Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. You should 
not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding. Metformin passes into human milk in small amounts. It 
is not known if dapagliflozin passes into human breast milk.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Taking it with 
other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood, such as insulin or a  sulphonylurea<br />
medicine, can cause too low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as 
weakness, dizziness, increased sweating, fast heart beat, change in vision or difficulties concentrating, 
and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or use any tools or machines, if 
you start to feel these symptoms.
Sodium content
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

in your blood. These may be medicine(s) by mouth or given by injection, such as insulin or a GLP-1 
receptor agonist. Remember to take these other medicine(s) as your doctor has told you. This will help 
get the best results for your health.
Diet and exercise
To control your diabetes, you still need to keep to diet and exercise, even when you are taking this 
medicine. So it is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise from your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. In particular, if you are following a diabetic weight control diet, continue to 
follow it while you are taking this medicine.
If you take more Xigduo than you should
If you take more Xigduo tablets than you should, you may experience lactic acidosis. Symptoms of 
lactic acidosis include feeling or being very sick, vomiting, stomach ache, muscular cramps, severe 
tiredness or difficulty breathing. If this happens to you, you may need immediate hospital treatment, as 
lactic acidosis may lead to coma. Stop taking this medicine immediately and contact a doctor or the 
nearest hospital straight away (see section 2). Take the medicine pack with you.
If you forget to take Xigduo
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your 
next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose of 
this medicine to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Xigduo
Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first. Your blood sugar may increase 
without this medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
