metabolism. It is used to treat two conditions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Yargesa is used to treat mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease in adults. 
In type 1 Gaucher disease, a substance called glucosylceramide is not removed from your body. It 
starts to build up in certain cells of the body s immune system. This can result in liver and spleen 
enlargement, changes in the blood and bone disease. </li>
</ul>
<p>The usual treatment for type 1 Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy. Yargesa is only used 
when a patient is considered unsuitable for treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. </p>
<ul>
<li>Yargesa is also used to treat progressive neurological symptoms in Niemann-Pick type C 
disease in adults and in children. 
If you have Niemann-Pick type C disease, fats such as glycosphingolipids build up in the cells of your 
brain. This can result in disturbances in neurological functions such as slow eye movements, balance, 
swallowing, and memory, and in seizures. </li>
</ul>
<p>Yargesa works by inhibiting the enzyme called  glucosylceramide synthase  which is responsible for 
the first step in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. </p>         </div>"""

6) </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Yargesa 
* if you suffer from kidney disease 
* if you suffer from liver disease 
Your doctor will perform the following tests before treatment and during treatment with Yargesa 
* an examination to check the nerves in your arms and legs 
* measurement of vitamin B12 levels 
* monitoring growth if you are a child or adolescent with Niemann-Pick type C disease 
* monitoring of blood platelet counts 
The reason for these tests is that some patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, or 
a decrease in body weight, while taking this medicine. The tests will help the doctor decide whether 
these effects are due to your disease or other existing conditions, or due to side effects of Yargesa (see 
section 4 for further details). 
If you have diarrhoea, your doctor may ask you to change your diet to reduce your lactose and 
carbohydrate intake such as sucrose (cane sugar), or not to take Yargesa together with food, or to 
temporarily reduce your dose. In some cases the doctor may prescribe anti-diarrhoeal medicines such 
as loperamide. If your diarrhoea does not respond to these measures, or if you have any other 
abdominal complaint, consult your doctor. In such case, your doctor may decide to conduct further 
investigations. </p>
<p>Male patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with Yargesa and for 3 
months after finishing treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents (below 18 years old) with type 1 Gaucher 
disease because it is not known if it works in this disease. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Yargesa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing imiglucerase, which are sometimes used at the 
same time as Yargesa. They may lower the amount of Yargesa in your body. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You should not take Yargesa if you are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant. Your doctor can 
give you more information. You must use effective birth control while taking Yargesa. Do not 
breast-feed while you are taking Yargesa. 
Male patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with this medicine and 
for 3 months after finishing treatment. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Yargesa may make you feel dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy. </p>
<p>Yargesa contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially 'sodium-free'. </p>         </div>"""

Dose 
* For type 1 Gaucher disease: For adults, the usual dose is one capsule (100 mg) three times a 
day(morning, afternoon and evening). This means a daily maximum of three capsules (300 mg). 
* For Niemann-Pick type C disease: For adults and adolescents (over 12 years old), the usual 
dose is two capsules (200 mg) three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening). This means 
a daily maximum of six capsules (600 mg). 
For children less than 12 years old, your doctor will adjust the dose for Niemann-Pick type C disease. 
If you have a problem with your kidneys you may receive a lower starting dose. Your doctor may 
reduce your dose, e.g., to one capsule (100 mg) once or twice a day, if you suffer from diarrhoea when 
taking Yargesa (see section 4). Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last. </p>
<p>To remove the capsule: 
1. Separate at perforations 
2. Peel back paper at arrows 
3. Push product through foil </p>
<p>Yargesa can be taken with or without food. You should swallow the whole capsule with a glass of 
water. </p>
<p>If you take more Yargesa than you should 
If you take more capsules than you were told to, consult your doctor immediately. Miglustat has been 
used in clinical trials at doses up to 3000 mg : this caused decreases in white blood cells and other 
side effects similar to those described in section 4. If you forget to take Yargesa </p>
<p>Take the next capsule at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Yargesa 
Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

Most serious side effects 
Some patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet (seen commonly). They could 
be signs of peripheral neuropathy, due to side effects of Yargesa or they could be due to existing 
conditions. Your doctor will perform some tests before and during treatment with Yargesa to assess 
this (see section 2). </p>
<p>If you do get any of these effects, please seek medical advice from your doctor as soon as 
possible. 
If you get a slight tremor, usually trembling hands, seek medical advice from your doctor as soon 
as possible. The tremor often disappears without needing to stop the treatment. Sometimes your doctor 
will need to reduce the dose or stop Yargesa treatment to stop the tremor. </p>
<p>Very common effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
The most common side effects are diarrhoea, flatulence (wind), abdominal (stomach) pain, weight loss 
and decreased appetite. </p>
<p>If you do lose some weight when you start treatment with Yargesa don t worry. People usually stop 
losing weight as treatment goes on. </p>
<p>Common effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
Common side effects of treatment include headache, dizziness, paraesthesia (tingling or numbness), 
abnormal coordination, hypoaesthesia (reduced sensation to touch), dyspepsia (heartburn), nausea 
(feeling sick), constipation and vomiting, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (stomach) and 
thrombocytopenia (reduced levels of blood platelets).The neurological symptoms and 
thrombocytopenia could be due to the underlying disease. </p>
<p>Other possible side effects are muscular spasms or weakness, fatigue, chills and malaise, depression, 
difficulty sleeping, forgetfulness and reduced libido. 
Most patients get one or more of these side effects, usually at the start of treatment or at intervals 
during treatment. Most cases are mild and disappear quite quickly. If any of these side effects cause 
problems, consult your doctor. He or she may reduce the dose of Yargesa or recommend other 
medicines to help control side effects. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system<br />
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety
