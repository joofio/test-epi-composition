<p>if you are allergic to ipilimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
Section 6 "Contents of the pack and other information"). Talk to your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using YERVOY as it may cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with your heart such as a change in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat or an 
abnormal heart rythm. </li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the intestines (colitis) which can worsen to bleedings or bowel perforation. 
Signs and symptoms of colitis may include diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools), an increased 
number of bowel movements than usual, blood in your stools or darker-coloured stools, pain or 
tenderness in your stomach area. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of 
inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) that can lead to liver failure. Signs and symptoms of 
hepatitis may include eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach 
area, tiredness. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the skin that can lead to severe skin reaction (known as toxic epidermal 
necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS)). Signs and symptoms of severe skin reaction may include such as skin 
rash with or without itching, peeling of the skin, dry skin, fever, fatigue, swelling of the face or 
lymph glands, increase of eosinophils (type of white blood cells) and effects on liver, kidneys or 
lungs. Please note that the reaction called DRESS may develop weeks or months after your last 
dose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the nerves that can lead to paralysis. Symptoms of nerve problems may 
include muscle weakness, numbness or tingling in your hands or feet, loss of consciousness or 
difficulty waking up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal 
kidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of hormone producing glands (especially the pituitary, adrenal and thyroid 
glands) that may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms that your glands are not 
working properly may include headaches, blurry or double vision, tiredness, decreased sexual 
drive, behavioral changes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type 1 Diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from diabetes). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the muscles such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), myositis 
(inflammation of the muscles) and rhabdomyolysis (stiffness in muscles and joints, muscle 
spasm). Signs and symptoms may include muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, chest pain, or 
severe fatigue. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the eyes. Signs and symptoms may include redness in the eye, pain in the eye, 
vision problems, blurry vision or temporary loss of sight. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A rare disease in which our immune system makes 
too many of otherwise normal infection fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. 
Symptoms may include enlarged liver and/or spleen, skin rash, lymph node enlargement, 
breathing problems, easy bruising, kidney abnormalities, and heart problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organ transplant rejection. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or they get worse. Do not 
try to treat your symptoms with other medicines. Your doctor may give you other medicines in 
order to prevent more severe complications and reduce your symptoms, withhold the next dose of 
YERVOY, or stop your treatment with YERVOY altogether. 
Please note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed, and may develop weeks or months 
after your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have 
blood tests during treatment. 
Check with your doctor or nurse before you are given YERVOY </p>
<p>if you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); </p>
<p>if you have, or have ever had, chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) 
or hepatitis C (HCV); </p>
<p>if you have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS). </p>
<p>if you have previously experienced a severe skin adverse reaction on a prior cancer therapy. </p>
<p>if you have any history of inflammation of the lungs </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
YERVOY should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age except for adolescents 
12 years of age and older with melanoma. </p>
<p>Other medicines and YERVOY 
Before you are given YERVOY, tell your doctor </p>
<p>if you are taking any medicines that suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids. 
These medicines may interfere with the effect of YERVOY. However, once you are treated with 
YERVOY, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce the side-effects that you may 
have with YERVOY. </p>
<p>if you are taking any medicines that stop your blood from clotting (anticoagulants). These 
medicines may increase the likelihood of bleeding in the stomach or intestine, which is a side-
effect of YERVOY. </p>
<p>if you have recently been prescribed Zelboraf (vemurafenib, another medicine for the treatment 
of skin cancer). When YERVOY is given following prior vemurafenib there may be an 
increased risk of skin side-effects. </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. </p>
<p>Do not take any other medicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. Based on 
early data, the combination of YERVOY (ipilimumab) and vemurafenib is not recommended due to 
increased toxicity to the liver. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are 
breast-feeding. </p>
<p>You must not use YERVOY if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The 
effects of YERVOY in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substance, 
ipilimumab, could harm an unborn baby. </p>
<p>You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with YERVOY if you are a 
woman who could become pregnant. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant while using YERVOY tell your doctor. </p>
<p>It is not known whether ipilimumab gets into breast milk. However, significant exposure of 
ipilimumab to the infant through breast milk is not expected and no effects on the breast-fed infant are 
anticipated. Ask your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with YERVOY. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, cycle or use machines after you have been given YERVOY unless you are sure you are 
feeling well. Feeling tired or weak is a very common side effect of YERVOY. This can affect your 
ability to drive, cycle or to use machines. </p>
<p>YERVOY contains sodium 
Tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given YERVOY. 
This medicine contains 23 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10 ml vial. This 
is equivalent to 1.15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains 92 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 40 ml vial. This 
is equivalent to 4.60% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult </p>         </div>"""
