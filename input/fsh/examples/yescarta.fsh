<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to axicabtagene ciloleucel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </li>
<li>If you cannot receive treatment, called lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which reduces the 
number of white blood cells in your blood (see also section 3, How Yescarta is given). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Yescarta is made from your own white blood cells and must only be given to you (autologous use). </p>
<p>Before you are given Yescarta you must tell your doctor if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have problems with your nervous system (such as fits, stroke, or memory loss). </li>
<li>have kidney problems. </li>
<li>have low blood cell levels (blood counts). </li>
<li>have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months. </li>
<li>have any lung, heart or blood pressure (low or raised) problems. </li>
<li>have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease. This happens when transplanted cells 
attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody 
stools. </li>
<li>notice the symptoms of your cancer are getting worse. If you have lymphoma this might include 
fever, feeling weak, night sweats, sudden weight loss. </li>
<li>have an infection. The infection will be treated before the Yescarta infusion. </li>
<li>have had hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given 
Yescarta. </p>
<p>Tests and checks 
Before you are given Yescarta your doctor will: 
* Check your lungs, heart and blood pressure. 
* Look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given Yescarta. 
* Check if your cancer is getting worse. 
* Look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. 
* Check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. This will 
show if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome. You may be given 
medicines to help prevent the condition. 
* Check for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection. 
* Check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next 
few months. </p>
<p>After you have been given Yescarta 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following: 
* Chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or rapid 
heartbeat, which may be symptoms of a condition known as cytokine release syndrome. Take 
your temperature twice a day for 3-4 weeks after treatment with Yescarta. If your temperature is 
high, see your doctor immediately. 
* Fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level 
of consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. 
* Fever, which may be a symptom of an infection. 
* Extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red 
blood cells. 
* Bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood 
known as platelets. 
* Blurred vision, loss of vision or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness or clumsiness of 
an arm or a leg, a change in the way you walk or problems with your balance, personality 
changes, changes in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion. These may all be 
symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal brain condition known as progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). These symptoms may start several months after treatment has 
ended and they usually develop slowly and gradually over weeks or months. It is important that 
your relatives or caregivers are also aware of these symptoms, since they may notice symptoms 
that you are not aware of. </p>
<p>Your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood 
components may decrease. </p>
<p>Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplants. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
Yescarta. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with Yescarta. </p>
<p>In some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with Yescarta. For 
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Yescarta infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received preparatory 
chemotherapy you may have to receive more preparative chemotherapy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Yescarta must not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age because Yescarta has not 
been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Yescarta 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Before you are given Yescarta tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
your immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
Yescarta. </p>
<p>In particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
* In the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of chemotherapy (called lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy) to prepare your body for the Yescarta cells. 
* During Yescarta treatment. 
* After treatment while the immune system is recovering. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. This is because the effects of Yescarta in 
pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your 
breast-fed child. 
* If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Yescarta, talk to your 
doctor immediately. 
* You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Yescarta can only be given if the 
results show you are not pregnant. </p>
<p>Discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Yescarta. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some people may feel tired, dizzy or have some shaking after being given Yescarta. If this happens to 
you, do not drive or use heavy machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until your doctor tells 
you that you have completely recovered. </p>
<p>Yescarta contains sodium, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and residual gentamicin 
This medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion bag. 
This is the equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult.  </p>
<p>This medicine contains DMSO and residual gentamicin which may cause severe allergic reactions. </p>         </div>"""

vein (intravenously). </p>
<ul>
<li>Since Yescarta is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you 
to prepare your medicine. Your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in 
your vein (a procedure call leukapheresis). Some of your white blood cells are separated from 
your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. This can take 3 to 6 hours and 
may need to be repeated. </li>
<li>Your white blood cells are sent away to make Yescarta. It usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks to 
receive your Yescarta therapy but the time may vary. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines given before Yescarta treatment 
During the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Yescarta you may be given other medicines. This is 
to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. These other medicines may include: 
* Paracetamol. 
* An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. </p>
<p>Prior to receiving Yescarta, you will be given other medicines such as preparative chemotherapy, 
which will allow your modified white blood cells in Yescarta to multiply in your body when the 
medicine is given to you. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will check carefully that this medicine is yours. </p>
<p>How Yescarta is given 
Yescarta will always be given to you by a doctor in a qualified treatment centre. </p>
<ul>
<li>Yescarta is given in a single dose. </li>
<li>Your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of Yescarta through a catheter placed into 
your vein (intravenous infusion) over about 30 minutes. </li>
</ul>
<p>You must receive Yescarta infusion in a qualified clinical facility and be discharged only when your 
doctor thinks it is safe for you to go home. 
Your doctor may do blood tests to check for side effects. </p>
<p>After Yescarta is given 
* Plan to stay within proximity from the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after 
you have been given Yescarta. Your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital daily 
for at least 10 days and will consider whether you need to stay at the hospital as an in-patient for 
the first 10 days after infusion. This is so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and 
help you if you have any side effects. </p>
<p>If you miss an appointment 
Call your doctor or the qualified treatment centre as soon as possible to make another appointment. </p>         </div>"""
