Zabdeno is a vaccine used to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.
It is given to people aged 1 year and older who may possibly come into contact with Ebola virus.
Zabdeno is given as the first dose of a 2-dose course of vaccinations to protect you from getting Ebola 
virus disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus, which is a type of Filovirus. This vaccine will not protect 
you against the other types of Filovirus.
Because Zabdeno does not contain the whole Ebola virus, it cannot give you Ebola virus disease.
The 2-dose course of vaccinations consists of:</p>
<p>a first dose of Zabdeno vaccine,</p>
<p>followed around 8 weeks later by a dose with Mvabea vaccine.
Even after you have had the course of Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccination you should be very careful
not to come into contact with Ebola virus. As with all vaccinations, the vaccination course may not 
fully protect everyone from Ebola virus disease.
The Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccinations should be used according to official 
recommendations.
What is Ebola</p>
<p>Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. People catch Ebola from people or animals who are 
infected with Ebola virus or who died from Ebola.</p>
<p>You can catch Ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat, breast 
milk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with Ebola virus.</p>
<p>You can also catch Ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person or 
animal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).</p>
<p>Ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.
Ebola virus disease usually causes a high fever   and it can stop the blood from clotting, causing 
severe bleeding ( severe haemorrhagic fever ). This can lead to serious illness, and in some cases 
death.</p>
<p>First signs and symptoms may be fever, feeling tired, weak or dizzy, and muscle aches.</p>
<p>Later signs and symptoms may include bleeding under the skin, into organs in the body such as 
the liver or kidneys and from the mouth, eyes or ears. Some people get severe diarrhea, sudden 
drop in blood pressure or blood flow to the organs in the body (shock) which may cause serious 
and permanent damage to these organs, severe confusion (delirium), fits (seizures), kidney 
failure and coma.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first to decide if you should be given this vaccine.
How the vaccine works
The Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose vaccine course stimulates the body s natural defences (immune 
system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the 
virus that causes the Ebola infection. This will help to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>To make sure that the vaccination course is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything 
you do not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain.
Do not have the vaccine if</p>
<p>you or your child have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any of the active substances or any 
of the other ingredients listed in section 6. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Zabdeno if you or your child:</p>
<p>have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection,</p>
<p>have ever fainted, after having an injection,</p>
<p>have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily,</p>
<p>currently have a fever or an infection,</p>
<p>are taking medicines that weaken the immune system, such as high-dose corticosteroids (such as 
prednisone) or chemotherapy (cancer medicines),</p>
<p>have a weak immune system   for example, due to HIV infection or an illness that runs in the 
family ( genetic disorder ).
If any of the above apply to you or your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Zabdeno.
If you are at high risk of being in contact with the Ebola virus, a booster vaccination with Zabdeno 
may be recommended for you or your child. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if this applies to 
you or your child.
If you or your child only has one of the vaccines, Zabdeno or Mvabea, it may give less protection from 
Ebola virus disease than having a course of both vaccines.
As with all vaccines, the Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccination may not fully protect 
everyone from Ebola virus disease and it is not known how long you will be protected.</p>
<p>People who have been given the 2-dose course of vaccination should still take precautions 
to avoid coming into contact with Ebola virus.
Washing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like
Ebola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to
person.
Proper hand washing methods are described below.</p>
<p>Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. There is no 
need to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands.</p>
<p>Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. Do not use alcohol-based hand 
sanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.
While in an area affected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the following:</p>
<p>Contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, 
semen, and vaginal fluids).</p>
<p>Items that may have come in contact with an infected person s blood or body fluids (such as 
clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).</p>
<p>Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.</p>
<p>Contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these 
animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.</p>
<p>Contact with semen from a man who had Ebola. You should follow safe sex practices until the 
virus is gone from the semen. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice about how 
long to maintain safe sex practices.
Children younger than 1 year of age
There is no recommendation for use of Zabdeno in children younger than 1 year of age.
Other medicines and Zabdeno
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take, any 
other medicines or vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before having this vaccine if you or your child is pregnant or 
breast-feeding. Also do this if you think you or your child may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby.
Driving and using machines
Zabdeno has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
Zabdeno contains Sodium
Zabdeno contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 0.5 mL, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .
Zabdeno contains ethanol (alcohol)
This medicine contains .002 mg of alcohol (ethanol) per dose of 0.5 mL. The small amount of alcohol 
in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.</p>         </div>"""

This leaflet was last revised in &lt;{MM/YYYY}&gt;&lt;{month YYYY}&gt;.
This vaccine has been authorised under  exceptional circumstances . This means that for scientific 
reasons it has been impossible to get complete information on this medicine.
The European Medicines Agency will review any new information on this vaccine every year and this 
leaflet will be updated as necessary.
Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
This leaflet is available in all EU/EEA languages on the European Medicines Agency website.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:</p>
<p>As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be 
readily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of
Zabdeno. Individuals should be observed by a healthcare professional for at least 15 minutes 
after vaccination.</p>
<p>Zabdeno must not be mixed with other medicinal products in the same syringe.</p>
<p>Zabdeno must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular (IM) injection preferably in the upper arm 
in the region of the deltoid or in the thigh.</p>
<p>Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic 
response to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling 
and to manage syncopal reactions.
Instructions for administration and handling
Zabdeno is a colourless to slightly yellow, clear to very opalescent suspension. The vaccine should be 
inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. The vial should be 
inspected visually for cracks or any abnormalities, such as evidence of tampering prior to 
administration. If there are signs of any of these, do not administer the vaccine.
Once the vaccine has been removed from the freezer and thawed, use immediately or store in a 
refrigerator at 2 C to 8 C (see section 6.4). Once removed from the refrigerator for administration, it 
should be used immediately.
Gently mix the contents of the vial by swirling for 10 seconds. Do not shake. Use a sterile needle and 
sterile syringe to extract the entire contents from the vial for administration.
Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. It is not necessary to change needles 
between drawing up the vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient, unless the needle has been 
damaged or contaminated. Any remaining content in the vial should be discarded.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance to local 
requirements. Potential spills should be disinfected with agents with viricidal activity against 
adenovirus.
Information about storage
Do not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after EXP. The expiry date 
refers to the last day of that month.
Transport frozen at -25 C to -15 C. Upon receipt, the product can be stored as indicated below:
Store in a freezer at -85 C to -55 C at the distributor in case of stockpiling. The expiry date for storage 
at -85 C to -55 C is printed on the vial and outer carton after EXP.
The vaccine can also be stored by the distributor or end user in a freezer at -25 C to -15 C for a single 
period of up to 20 months. Upon removal from the -85 C to -55 C freezer, the new expiry date must 
be written by the distributor or end user on the outer carton and the vaccine should be used or 
discarded at the end of the 20 months. This new expiry date should not exceed the original expiry date
(EXP). The original expiry date should be made unreadable.
The vaccine can also be stored by the distributor or end user in a refrigerator at 2 C to 8 C for a single 
period of up to 8 months. Upon moving the product to 2 C to 8 C storage, the discard date must be 
written by the distributor or end user on the outer carton and the vaccine should be used or discarded 
at the end of the 8 months period. This discard date should not exceed the original expiry date (EXP), 
or the new expiry date assigned for the -25 C to -15 C storage condition. The original expiry date 
and/or the new expiry date assigned for the -25 C to -15 C storage condition should be made 
unreadable.
Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be refrozen.
The vial must be kept in the original package in order to protect from light and to track the expiry or 
discard date for the different storage conditions.</p>         </div>"""
