Zavicefta is an antibiotic medicine that contains two active substances ceftazidime and avibactam.</p>
<p>Ceftazidime belongs to the group of antibiotics called  cephalosporins . It can kill many types 
of bacteria.</p>
<p>Avibactam is a  beta-lactamase inhibitor  that helps ceftazidime kill some bacteria that it cannot 
kill on its own.
What Zavicefta is used for
Zavicefta is used in adults and paediatric patients aged 3 months and over to treat:</p>
<p>infections of the stomach and gut (abdomen)</p>
<p>infections of the bladder or kidneys called  urinary tract infections </p>
<p>an infection of the lungs called  pneumonia </p>
<p>infections caused by bacteria that other antibiotics may not be able to kill
Zavicefta is used in adults to treat infection of the blood associated with infections of the abdomen,
urinary tract, or pneumonia.
How Zavicefta works
Zavicefta works by killing certain types of bacteria, which can cause serious infections.</p>         </div>"""

<p>you are allergic to ceftazidime, avibactam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)</p>
<p>you are allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics</p>
<p>you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to other antibiotics belonging to the penicillin or 
carbapenem groups
Do not use Zavicefta if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before using Zavicefta.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Zavicefta if:</p>
<p>you have ever had any allergic reaction (even if only a skin rash) to other antibiotics belonging 
to the penicillin or carbapenem groups</p>
<p>you have kidney problems - your doctor may give you a lower dose to make sure you don t get 
too much medicine. This could cause symptoms such as fits (see section If you use more 
Zavicefta than you should)
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using 
Zavicefta.
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment.
Other infections
There is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or 
after treatment with Zavicefta. These include thrush (fungal infections of the mouth or genital area).
Lab tests
Tell your doctor that you are taking Zavicefta if you are going to have any tests. This is because you 
may get an abnormal result with a test called  DAGT  or  Coombs . This test looks for antibodies that 
fight against your red blood cells.
Zavicefta can also affect the results of some urine tests for sugar. Tell the person taking the sample that 
you have been given Zavicefta.
Paediatric patients
Zavicefta should not be used in paediatric patients aged under 3 months. This is because it is not 
known if the medicine is safe to use in this age group.
Other medicines and Zavicefta
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Talk to your doctor before using Zavicefta if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<p>an antibiotic called chloramphenicol</p>
<p>a type of antibiotic called an aminoglycoside   such as gentamicin, tobramycin</p>
<p>a water tablet called furosemide</p>
<p>a medicine for gout called probenecid
Tell your doctor before using Zavicefta if any of the above apply to you.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Zavicefta may make you feel dizzy. This may affect you being able to drive, use tools or machines.
Zavicefta contains sodium
This medicine contains approximately 146 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
vial. This is equivalent to 7.3% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake for sodium for an 
adult.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you need 3 or more vials daily for a prolonged period, especially 
if you have been advised to have a low salt (sodium) diet.</p>         </div>"""

How much to use
The recommended dose for adults is one vial (2 g of ceftazidime and 0.5 g of avibactam), every 
8 hours. The dose for paediatric patients aged 3 months and over will be calculated by the doctor based 
on the weight and age of the child.
It is given as a drip into a vein   this will normally take about 2 hours.
A course of treatment usually lasts from 5 to up to 14 days, depending on the type of infection you 
have and how you respond to treatment.
People with kidney problems
If you have kidney problems your doctor may lower your dose. This is because Zavicefta is removed 
from your body by the kidneys.
If you use more Zavicefta than you should
Zavicefta will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong 
dose. However, if you have side effects or think you have been given too much Zavicefta, tell your 
doctor or nurse straight away. If you have too much Zavicefta it could have an effect on the brain and 
cause fits or coma.
If you miss a dose of Zavicefta
If you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
