<p>Zeffix is used to treat long term (chronic) hepatitis B infection in adults. </p>
<p>Zeffix is an antiviral medicine that suppresses the hepatitis B virus and belongs to a group of 
medicines called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). </p>
<p>Hepatitis B is a virus which infects the liver, causes long term (chronic) infection, and can lead to liver 
damage. Zeffix can be used in people whose liver is damaged, but still functions normally 
(compensated liver disease) and in combination with other medicines in people whose liver is damaged 
and does not function normally (decompensated liver disease). </p>
<p>Treatment with Zeffix can reduce the amount of hepatitis B virus in your body. This should lead to a 
reduction in liver damage and an improvement in your liver function. Not everyone responds to 
treatment with Zeffix in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the effectiveness of your treatment 
with regular blood tests. </p>         </div>"""

Section 6). 
  Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Some people taking Zeffix or other similar medicines are more at risk of serious side effects. You need 
to be aware of the extra risks: 
* if you have ever had other types of liver disease, such as hepatitis C 
* if you re seriously overweight (especially if you re a woman). 
  Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-ups, including blood 
tests, while you re taking your medication. See Section 4 for more information about the risks.  </p>
<p>Don t stop taking Zeffix without your doctor s advice, as there is a risk of your hepatitis getting 
worse. When you stop taking Zeffix your doctor will monitor you for at least four months to check for 
any problems. This will mean taking blood samples to check for any raised liver enzyme levels, which 
may indicate liver damage. See section 3 for more information about how to take Zeffix. </p>
<p>Protect other people<br />
Hepatitis B infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of 
infected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). Zeffix will not stop you passing hepatitis B 
infection on to other people. To protect other people from becoming infected with hepatitis B: 
  Use a condom when you have oral or penetrative sex. 
  Don t risk blood transfer   for example, don t share needles. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zeffix 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you re taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.  </p>
<p>Remember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you re taking 
Zeffix. </p>
<p>These medicines should not be used with Zeffix: 
  medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, 
mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly 
  other medicines containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection (sometimes called the AIDS 
virus) 
  emtricitabine used to treat HIV or hepatitis B infection 
  cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you re being treated with any of these.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby: </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Zeffix during your pregnancy. 
Do not stop treatment with Zeffix without your doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Zeffix can pass into breast-milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: 
  Talk to your doctor before you take Zeffix. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zeffix may make you feel tired, which could affect your ability to drive or use machines.<br />
  Don t drive or use machines unless you are sure you re not affected. </p>
<p>Zeffix contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

pharmacist if you re not sure. </p>
<p>Stay in regular contact with your doctor<br />
Zeffix helps to control your hepatitis B infection. You need to keep taking it every day to control your 
infection and stop your illness getting worse. 
  Keep in touch with your doctor, and don t stop taking Zeffix without your doctor s advice. </p>
<p>How much to take<br />
The usual dose of Zeffix is one tablet (100 mg lamivudine) once a day.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose if you have problems with your kidneys. An oral solution of 
Zeffix is available for people who need a lower than usual dose, or who can t take tablets. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if this applies to you.  </p>
<p>If you are already taking another medicine that contains lamivudine for HIV infection, your doctor 
will continue to treat you with the higher dose, (usually 150 mg twice a day), because the dose of 
lamivudine in Zeffix (100 mg) is not enough to treat HIV infection. If you are planning to change your 
HIV treatment, discuss this change with your doctor first. </p>
<p>Swallow the tablet whole, with some water. Zeffix can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more Zeffix than you should<br />
If you accidentally take too much Zeffix, tell your doctor or your pharmacist, or contact your nearest 
hospital emergency department for further advice. If possible, show them the Zeffix pack. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Zeffix 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before. 
Don t take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  </p>
<p>Don t stop taking Zeffix 
You must not stop taking Zeffix without consulting your doctor. There is a risk of your hepatitis 
getting worse (see section 2). When you stop taking Zeffix your doctor will monitor you for at least 
four months to check for any problems. This will mean taking blood samples to check for any raised 
liver enzyme levels, which may indicate liver damage. </p>         </div>"""

  difficulty swallowing or breathing </p>
<p>Contact a doctor immediately if you get these symptoms. Stop taking Zeffix. </p>

<p>A very common side effect (these may affect more than 1 in 10 people) which may show up in 
blood tests is:

inflammation or damage in the liver. </p>
<p>A common side effect (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people) is: 
  cramps and muscle pains<br />
  skin rash or  hives  anywhere on the body </p>
<p>A common side effect which may show up in blood tests is: </p>
<ul>
<li>an increase in the level of an enzyme produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase) which 
may be a sign that body tissue is damaged. </li>
</ul>
<p>A very rare side effect (these may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) is: 
* lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood). </p>
<p>Other side effects<br />
Other side effects have occurred in a very small number of people but their exact frequency is 
unknown 
* breakdown of muscle tissue 
* a worsening of liver disease after Zeffix is stopped or during treatment if the hepatitis B virus 
becomes resistant to Zeffix. This can be fatal in some people. </p>
<p>A side effect which may show up in blood tests is: 
* a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia).  </p>

<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this
