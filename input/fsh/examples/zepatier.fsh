ZEPATIER is an antiviral medicine that contains the active substances elbasvir and grazoprevir.
What ZEPATIER is used for
ZEPATIER is used to treat long-term hepatitis C infection in adults and children aged 12 years and
older who weigh at least 30 kilograms.
How ZEPATIER works
Hepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. The active substances in the medicine work together by
blocking two different proteins that the hepatitis C virus needs to grow and reproduce. This allows the
infection to be permanently removed from the body. 
ZEPATIER is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin.
It is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with
ZEPATIER. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

contact your doctor or pharmacist.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ZEPATIER if you: </p>
<p>have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to
monitor you more closely</p>
<p>have ever taken any medicine for hepatitis C</p>
<p>have any liver problems other than hepatitis C</p>
<p>have had a liver transplant</p>
<p>have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment
of your diabetes medication after starting ZEPATIER. Some diabetic patients have experienced
low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like
ZEPATIER.</p>
<p>have any other medical conditions.
Blood tests 
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with ZEPATIER. This is so
your doctor can: </p>
<p>decide if you should take ZEPATIER and for how long</p>
<p>decide what other medicines you should take with ZEPATIER and for how long</p>
<p>check for side effects </p>
<p>check if your treatment has worked and you are free of hepatitis C</p>
<p>check how your liver is working - tell your doctor straight away if you have any of the
following signs of liver problems: loss of appetite; feeling or being sick; feeling tired or weak;
yellowing of your skin or eyes; colour changes in your stool. Your doctor may want to test your
blood to check how your liver is working if you develop any of these symptoms.
Children 
ZEPATIER is not for use in children younger than 12 years of age.
Other medicines and ZEPATIER
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. This includes herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription. Keep a list
of your medicines and show it to your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. 
There are some medicines you must not take with ZEPATIER. See list under  Do not take
ZEPATIER if you are taking any of the following medicines. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines:</p>
<p>oral ketoconazole for fungal infections</p>
<p>tacrolimus to prevent organ transplant rejection</p>
<p>dabigatran to prevent blood clots</p>
<p>rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, or lovastatin, for lowering blood cholesterol</p>
<p>sunitinib to treat certain cancers</p>
<p>warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood. Your
doctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can
clot.
Your liver function may improve with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other
medications that are handled by the liver. Your doctor may need to closely monitor these other
medicines you are taking and make adjustments during ZEPATIER therapy.
Your doctor may have to change your medicines or change the dose of your medicines.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking
ZEPATIER.
Pregnancy and contraception

pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
ZEPATIER with ribavirin</p>
<p>You must not become pregnant if you are taking ZEPATIER with ribavirin. Ribavirin can be
very damaging to an unborn baby. This means you and your partner must take special
precautions in sexual activity if there is any chance you or your partner could become pregnant. </p>
<p>You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment with
ZEPATIER with ribavirin and for some time afterwards. Talk to your doctor about different
contraception methods that are suitable for you. </p>

months that follow, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>It is very important that you read the information concerning pregnancy and contraception in the
ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. It is important that both men and women read the
information.
Breast-feeding 
Talk to your doctor before taking ZEPATIER if you are breast-feeding. It is not known whether the
two medicines in ZEPATIER pass into human breast milk.
If you are taking ZEPATIER with ribavirin, make sure that you also read the Pregnancy and
Breast-feeding sections of the package leaflet for this other medicine.
