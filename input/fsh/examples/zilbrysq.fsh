body known as the C5 complement protein, which is a part of the immune system (the body s natural 
defences). By blocking this protein, zilucoplan prevents the body s immune system from attacking and 
destroying connections between nerves and muscles, thereby improving symptoms of the disease. </p>
<p>Zilbrysq is used together with standard therapy to treat adult patients with generalised myasthenia 
gravis (gMG), an autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness. It is used in adults whose immune 
system produces antibodies against a protein called the acetylcholine receptor, located on muscle cells. 
In patients with gMG, the muscles can be attacked and damaged by the immune system, which can 
lead to profound muscle weakness, impaired mobility, shortness of breath, extreme tiredness, 
difficulties swallowing and markedly impaired activities of daily living.  </p>
<p>Zilbrysq can reduce symptoms of the disease and improve the quality of life. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to zilucoplan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection. See warnings and precautions 
section.<br />
- if you have a meningococcal infection. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections alert 
As Zilbrysq inhibits the body s natural defences against infection, its use may increase your risk of 
infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis, such as meningococcal infection (severe infection of the 
linings of the brain and spinal cord and/or an infection of the blood) and also of other infections 
caused by Neisseria bacteria, such as gonorrhea. </p>
<p>Consult your doctor before you take Zilbrysq to be sure that you receive vaccination against Neisseria 
meningitidis, an organism that causes meningococcal infection, at least 2 weeks before beginning 
therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks beforehand, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to 
reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have received your first vaccine dose. Ensure that 
your meningococcal vaccinations are up to date. You should be aware that vaccination may not always 
prevent this type of infection. </p>
<p>If you are at risk of gonorrhoea (sexually transmitted bacterial infection), ask your doctor for advice 
before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Meningococcal infection symptoms 
Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating meningococcal infections in patients 
who receive Zilbrysq, you will be provided a card to carry with you at all times, listing specific signs 
and symptoms of possible meningococcal infection. It also contains information for healthcare 
professionals that may not be familiar with Zilbrysq. This card is named  patient alert card . You will 
also be provided a patient/carer guide which contains further information on Zilbrysq. </p>
<p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headache with additional symptoms such as nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, fever and stiff neck 
or back </li>
<li>Fever with or without a rash </li>
<li>Eyes sensitive to light </li>
<li>Confusion / drowsiness </li>
<li>Muscle pain with flu-like symptoms </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling 
If you are travelling in a region where you are unable to contact your doctor or will temporarily be 
unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic against Neisseria 
meningitidis to bring with you. If you experience any of the symptoms described above, you should 
take the antibiotic treatment as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should see a doctor as 
soon as possible, even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotic treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 18 years. Zilbrysq has not been studied in this 
age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zilbrysq 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>There is uncertainty about the effects that Zilbrysq can have to your unborn child, so do not use this 
medicine if you are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant unless your doctor specifically 
recommends it. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Zilbrysq passes into human milk. There may be a risk to newborns/infants.  </p>
<p>A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue Zilbrysq therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zilbrysq is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Zilbrysq contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 23 mg of sodium per pre-filled syringe, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

with you. Your doctor may also want to monitor you closely. </p>
