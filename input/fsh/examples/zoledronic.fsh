substances called bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing 
down the rate of bone change. It is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>to prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread of 
cancer from primary site to the bone). </li>
<li>to reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the 
presence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the 
release of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia (TIH). </li>

<p>Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zoledronic acid medac and will 
check your response to treatment at regular intervals. </p>
<p>You should not be given Zoledronic acid medac 
- if you are breast-feeding. 
- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which 
Zoledronic acid medac belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic acid medac, if you 
- have or have had a kidney problem. 
- have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or 
loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start 
treatment with Zoledronic acid medac. </p>
<ul>
<li>are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery; tell your dentist that you are 
being treated with Zoledronic acid medac and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>While being treated with Zoledronic acid medac, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including 
regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a 
condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw.<br />
Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are 
undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are 
smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry 
skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Irregular heart 
beat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to 
severe hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these 
apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be 
corrected before initiating the first dose of Zoledronic acid medac. You will be given adequate calcium 
and vitamin D supplements. </p>
<p>Patients aged 65 years and over 
Zoledronic acid medac can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest 
that any extra precautions are needed. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Zoledronic acid medac is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 
18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zoledronic acid medac 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used 
to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to 
treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the 
combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become 
too low. </li>
<li>Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any 
other medicines which may harm your kidneys. </li>
<li>Other medicines that also contain zoledronic acid and are used to treat osteoporosis and other 
non-cancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of 
these medicines taken together with Zoledronic acid medac are unknown. </li>
<li>Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with zoledronic 
acid has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not be given Zoledronic acid medac if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or 
think that you may be pregnant.  </p>
<p>You must not be given Zoledronic acid medac if you are breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of zoledronic acid. You 
should therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full 
attention. </p>
<p>Zoledronic acid medac contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. essentially  sodium-
free .  </p>         </div>"""

<li>Zoledronic acid medac must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering

dehydration. </li>
<li>Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </li>

<p>How much Zoledronic acid medac is given 
- The usual single dose given is 4 mg. 
- If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity 
of your kidney problem. </p>
<p>How often Zoledronic acid medac is given 
- If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you 
will be given one infusion of Zoledronic acid medac every three to four weeks. 
- If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only 
be given one infusion of Zoledronic acid medac. </p>
<p>How Zoledronic acid medac is given 
- Zoledronic acid medac is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 
15 minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion 
line. </p>
<p>Patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D 
supplements to be taken each day. </p>
<p>If you are given more Zoledronic acid medac than you should be 
If you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your 
doctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney 
impairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by 
infusion. </p>         </div>"""

signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you 
experience such symptoms while being treated with Zoledronic acid medac or after stopping 
treatment.<br />
- Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this 
irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms 
after you have received zoledronic acid.<br />

- As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to 
hypocalcaemia. 
- Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These 
could be signs of bone damage in the ear. 
- Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially 
the hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or 
worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zoledronic acid medac or after 
stopping treatment. </p>

- Conjunctivitis. 
- Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). </p>
<p>Uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people

- Slow heartbeat. 
- Confusion. 
- Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for 
osteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or

the thigh bone.
