bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing down the rate of 
bone change. It is used: 
* To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread 
of cancer from primary site to the bone). 
* To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the 
presence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the 
release of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia (TIH). </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zometa and will check your 
response to treatment at regular intervals. </p>
<p>You should not be given Zometa: </p>
<p>if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which 
Zometa belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zometa: </p>
<p>if you have or have had a kidney problem. </p>
<p>if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the 
jaw or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start 
treatment with Zometa. </p>
<p>if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that 
you are being treated with Zometa and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. </p>
<p>While being treated with Zometa, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth 
brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a 
condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are 
undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are 
smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry 
skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Irregular heart beat 
(cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to severe 
hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these apply to 
you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be corrected 
before initiating the first dose of Zometa. You will be given adequate calcium and vitamin D 
supplements. </p>
<p>Patients aged 65 years and over 
Zometa can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest that any extra 
precautions are needed. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Zometa is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zometa 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: </p>
<p>Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used 
to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to 
treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the 
combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become 
too low. </p>
<p>Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any 
other medicines which may harm your kidneys. </p>
<p>Aclasta (a medicine that also contains zoledronic acid and is used to treat osteoporosis and other 
non-cancer diseases of the bone), or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of 
these medicines taken together with Zometa are unknown. </p>
<p>Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with Zometa 
has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not be given Zometa if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or think that you may 
be pregnant. </p>
<p>You must not be given Zometa if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zometa. You should 
therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full attention. </p>
<p>Zometa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free . If your doctor uses a solution of common salt to dilute Zometa, the dose of sodium received 
would be larger. </p>         </div>"""

bisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. </p>
<p>Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent 
dehydration. </p>
<p>Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>How much Zometa is given </p>
<p>The usual single dose given is 4 mg. </p>
<p>If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity 
of your kidney problem. </p>
<p>How often Zometa is given </p>
<p>If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you 
will be given one infusion of Zometa every three to four weeks. </p>
<p>If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only 
be given one infusion of Zometa. </p>
<p>How Zometa is given </p>
<p>Zometa is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 minutes and should 
be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. </p>
<p>Patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D 
supplements to be taken each day. </p>
<p>If you are given more Zometa than you should be 
If you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your 
doctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney 
impairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by 
infusion. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Tell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): </p>
<p>Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific 
blood tests). </p>
<p>Low level of calcium in the blood. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): </p>
<p>Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, 
discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could 
be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if 
you experience such symptoms while being treated with Zometa or after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this 
irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms 
after you have received zoledronic acid. </p>
<p>Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. </p>
<p>Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): </p>
<p>As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to 
hypocalcaemia). </p>
<p>A kidney function disorder called Fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your 
doctor with certain urine tests). </p>
<p>Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): </p>
<p>As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to 
hypocalcaemia). </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These 
could be signs of bone damage in the ear. </p>
<p>Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially 
the hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or 
worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zometa or after stopping 
treatment. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): </p>
<p>Low level of phosphate in the blood. </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): </p>
<p>Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and 
bone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the 
symptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). </p>
<p>Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. </p>
<p>Conjunctivitis. </p>
<p>Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions. </p>
<p>Low blood pressure. </p>
<p>Chest pain. </p>
<p>Skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching. </p>
<p>High blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste 
disturbances, trembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhoea, constipation, 
abdominal pain, dry mouth. </p>
<p>Low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets. </p>
<p>Low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood. Your doctor will monitor this and take any 
necessary measures. </p>
<p>Weight increase. </p>
<p>Increased sweating. </p>
<p>Sleepiness. </p>
<p>Blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light. </p>
<p>Sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse. </p>
<p>Difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing. </p>
<p>Urticaria. </p>
<p>Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): </p>
<p>Slow heart beat. </p>
<p>Confusion. </p>
<p>Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for 
osteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or 
discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of 
the thigh bone. </p>
<p>Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs). </p>
<p>Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. </p>
<p>Painful redness and/or swelling of the eye. </p>
<p>Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): </p>
<p>Fainting due to low blood pressure. </p>
