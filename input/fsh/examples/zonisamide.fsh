- if you are allergic to zonisamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
- if you are allergic to other sulfonamide medicines. Examples include: sulfonamide 
antibiotics, thiazide diuretics, and sulfonylurea antidiabetes medicines. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Zonisamide Mylan belongs to a group of medicines (sulfonamides) which can cause severe allergic 
reactions, severe skin rashes, and blood disorders, which very rarely can be fatal (see section 4. Possible 
Side Effects). </p>
<p>A small number of people being treated with antiepileptics such as zonisamide have had thoughts of 
harming or killing themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, immediately contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Serious rashes occur in association with zonisamide therapy, including cases of Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome. </p>
<p>The use of Zonisamide Mylan may lead to high levels of ammonia in the blood which could lead to a 
change in brain function, especially if you are also taking other medicines which can increase ammonia 
levels (for example valproate), have a genetic disorder causing build-up of too much ammonia in the 
body (urea cycle disorder), or if you have liver problems. Tell your doctor immediately if you become 
unusually drowsy or confused. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zonisamide Mylan if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>are younger than 12 years old, as you may be at greater risk of decreased sweating, heat stroke, 
pneumonia and liver problems.  If you are younger than 6 years old, Zonisamide Mylan is not 
recommended for you </li>
<li>are elderly, as your dose of Zonisamide Mylan may need adjusting, and you may be more likely to 
develop an allergic reaction, severe skin rash, swelling of the feet and legs, and itchiness when 
taking Zonisamide Mylan (see section 4 Possible Side Effects) </li>
<li>suffer from liver problems, as your dose of Zonisamide Mylan may need adjusting </li>
<li>have eye problems such as glaucoma </li>
<li>suffer from kidney problems as your dose of Zonisamide Mylan may need adjusting </li>
<li>have previously suffered from kidney stones, as you may be at increased risk of developing more 
kidney stones. Reduce the risk of kidney stones by drinking sufficient water </li>
<li>live in a place or are on holiday in a place where the weather is warm. Zonisamide Mylan can make 
you perspire less, which can cause your body temperature to increase. Reduce the risk of 
overheating by drinking sufficient water and keeping cool </li>
<li>are underweight, or have lost a lot of weight as Zonisamide Mylan can cause you to lose more 
weight. Tell your doctor as this may need to be monitored. </li>
<li>are pregnant or could become pregnant (see section  pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  for 
further information). </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor before you take Zonisamide Mylan. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Talk to your doctor about the following risks:  </p>
<p>Preventing overheating and dehydration in children </p>
<p>Zonisamide Mylan can cause your child to sweat less and overheat and if your child is not treated this 
can lead to brain damage and death. Children are most at risk especially in hot weather. </p>
<p>When your child is taking Zonisamide Mylan:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep your child cool especially in hot weather </li>
<li>your child must avoid heavy exercise especially when the weather is hot </li>
<li>give your child plenty of cold water to drink </li>
<li>your child must not take these medicines: 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (like topiramate and acetazolamide), and anticholinergic agents (like 
clomipramine, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, haloperidol, imipramine and oxybutynin). </li>
</ul>
<p>If your child s skin feels very hot with little or no sweating, becomes confused, has muscle cramps, or 
your child s heartbeat or breathing becomes rapid:</p>
<ul>
<li>take your child to a cool, shaded place </li>
<li>sponge your child s skin with cool (not cold) water </li>
<li>give your child cold water to drink </li>
<li>
<p>seek urgent medical assistance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body weight: You should monitor your child s weight every month and see your doctor as soon as 
possible if your child is not gaining enough weight.  Zonisamide Mylan is not recommended for 
children who are underweight or have a small appetite, and should be used with caution in those 
below 20 kg. </p>
</li>
<li>Increased acid level in the blood and kidney stones: Reduce these risks by ensuring that your child 
drinks enough water and is not taking any other medicine which could cause kidney stones (see 
Other medicines).  Your doctor will monitor your child s blood bicarbonate levels and kidneys 
(see also section 4). </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 6 years because it is not known for this age 
group whether the potential benefits are greater than the risks. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zonisamide Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
- Zonisamide Mylan should be used carefully in adults when taken with medicines that can cause 
kidney stones, like topiramate or acetazolamide. In children, this combination is not 
recommended. 
- Zonisamide Mylan could possibly increase your blood levels of medicines like digoxin and 
quinidine, and so a reduction in their dose may be required. 
- Other medicines like phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone and rifampicin can decrease your 
blood levels of Zonisamide Mylan, which may require an adjustment of your dose of Zonisamide 
Mylan. </p>
<p>Zonisamide Mylan with food and drink 
Zonisamide Mylan can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are a woman of childbearing age you must use adequate contraception while taking, and for one 
month after stopping, Zonisamide Mylan. </p>
<p>If you are planning a pregnancy, talk to your doctor before you stop contraception and before you 
become pregnant about the possibility of switching to other suitable treatments. If you are or think you 
might be pregnant, tell your doctor straight away. You should not stop your treatment without discussing 
this with your doctor. </p>
<p>You must only take Zonisamide Mylan during your pregnancy if your doctor tells you to. Research has 
shown an increased risk of birth defects in children of women taking anti-epileptic medicines. The risk 
of birth defects or neurodevelopmental disorders (problems with brain development) for your child 
after taking Zonisamide Mylan during your pregnancy is unknown. A study showed that babies born to 
mothers using zonisamide during pregnancy were smaller than expected for their age at birth, compared 
with babies born to mothers treated with lamotrigine monotherapy. Make sure you are fully informed 
about the risks and the benefits of using zonisamide for epilepsy during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed whilst taking, or for one month after stopping Zonisamide Mylan. </p>
<p>There are no clinical data available on the effects of zonisamide on human fertility. Studies in animals 
have shown changes in fertility parameters. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zonisamide Mylan may affect your concentration, ability to react/respond, and may make you feel sleepy, 
particularly at the beginning of your treatment or after your dose is increased. Be especially careful while 
driving or operating machinery if Zonisamide Mylan affects you in this way. </p>
<p>Zonisamide Mylan contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<li>This may be increased by up to 100 mg at intervals of one to two weeks. </li>
<li>The recommended daily dose is between 300 mg and 500 mg. </li>
<li>Some people respond to lower doses. The dose may be increased more slowly if you experience 
side effects, are elderly or if you suffer from kidney or liver problems.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Use in children (aged 6 to 11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) weighing at least 
20 kg:</p>
<ul>
<li>The starting dose is 1 mg per kg of body weight taken once a day. </li>
<li>This may be increased by 1 mg per kg of body weight at intervals of one to two weeks. </li>
<li>The recommended daily dose is 6 to 8 mg per kg for a child with a body weight of up to 55 kg or 
300 to 500 mg for a child with a body weight more than 55 kg (which ever dose is lower) taken 
once a day. </li>
</ul>
<p>Example: A child who weighs 25 kg should take 25 mg once a day for the first week, and then increase 
the daily dose by 25 mg at the start of each week until a daily dose between 150 to 200 mg is reached. </p>
<p>If you feel that the effect of Zonisamide Mylan is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. </p>
<ul>
<li>Zonisamide Mylan capsules must be swallowed whole with water. </li>
<li>Do not chew the capsules. </li>
<li>Zonisamide Mylan can be taken once or twice daily, as instructed by your doctor. </li>
<li>If you take Zonisamide Mylan twice a day, take half the daily dose in the morning and half in the 
evening. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you take more Zonisamide Mylan than you should 
If you may have taken more Zonisamide Mylan than you should, tell a carer (relative or friend), your 
doctor or pharmacist immediately, or contact your nearest hospital casualty department, taking your 
medicine with you.  You may become sleepy and could lose consciousness. You might also feel sick, 
have a sore stomach, muscle twitches, eye movement, feel faint, have a slowed heartbeat, and reduced 
breathing and kidney function.  Do not try to drive. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Zonisamide Mylan 
- If you forget to take a dose, don t worry: take the next dose when it is due. 
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Zonisamide Mylan 
- Zonisamide Mylan is meant to be taken as a long-term medicine. Do not reduce your dose or 
stop your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. 
- If your doctor advises you to stop taking Zonisamide Mylan your dose will be reduced gradually 
to lower the risk of more seizures. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
