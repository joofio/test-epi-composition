</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Misuse, abuse and diversion 
 Serious cases of infections with potential fatal outcome may occur if Zubsolv is misused, by taking it 
intravenously. 
This medicine can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines, and should be kept in a 
safe place to protect it from theft (see section 5). Do not give this medicine to anyone else. It can 
cause death or otherwise harm them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathing problems (see also  Do not take Zubsolv  above ) 
Some people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) because they misused this 
medicine or took it in combination with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, 
benzodiazepines (tranquilisers), or other opioids. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This medicine should be used with care in patients with pre-existing breathing problems </p>
<p>This medicine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression (reduced ability to breathe) 
in children and non-opioid dependent people who accidentally or deliberately take it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drowsiness 
This medicine can cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or other central 
nervous system depressants (such as tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependence 
This medicine can cause dependence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver damage 
Liver damage has been reported after taking buprenorphine/naloxone, especially when the medicine 
is misused. This could also be due to viral infections (chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, anorexia 
or use of other medicines that can harm your liver (see section 4). Regular blood tests may be 
conducted by your doctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell your doctor if you have any 
liver problems before you start treatment with Zubsolv. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms 
This medicine can cause withdrawal symptoms if you take it less than six hours after you use a 
short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, heroin) or less than 24 hours after you use a long-acting 
opioid such as methadone. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zubsolv can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blood pressure 
This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you get 
up too quickly from sitting or lying down. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep-related breathing disorders<br />
Zubsolv can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during 
sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can include 
breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain 
sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, 
contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children and adolescents 
You may be more closely monitored by your doctor if you are below the age of 18. This medicine 
should not be taken by those under 15 years of age. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions 
This medicine may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases. Do not 
forget to advise your doctor if you take this medicine. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Zubsolv if you: 
* have a depression or other conditions that are treated with antidepressants. 
The use of these medicines together with Zubsolv can lead to serotonin syndrome, a 
potentially life-threatening condition (see  Other medicines and Zubsolv ) 
* have kidney problems 
* have recently suffered a head injury or brain disease 
* have low blood pressure, enlarged prostate gland or difficulties passing water because 
of narrowing of the urethra 
* have under-active thyroid gland which can cause tiredness or weight gain 
* have poor adrenal gland function (e.g. Addison s disease) 
* have problems with the biliary tract (e.g. gall bladder, bile duct) 
* are elderly 
* are debilitated </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zubsolv 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Some medicines may increase the side effects of Zubsolv and may sometimes cause very serious 
reactions. Do not take any other medicines whilst taking Zubsolv without first talking to your 
doctor, especially: 
* anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, 
fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, 
doxepine, or trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Zubsolv and you may 
experience symptoms such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the 
muscles that control movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive 
sweating, tremor, exaggeration of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature 
above 38 C. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
* Naltrexone and nalmefene (drugs used to treat addictive disorders) as they may prevent 
the therapeutic effects of Zubsolv. They must not be taken at the same time as Zubsolv 
treatment because you may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense withdrawal. 
* Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, temazepam, 
alprazolam. Concomitant use of Zubsolv and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines 
or related drugs increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory 
depression), coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should 
only be considered when other treatment options are not possible. However if your doctor 
does prescribe Zubsolv together with sedative medicines the dose and duration of 
concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. Please tell your doctor about all 
sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor s dose recommendation 
closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and 
symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
* Other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such 
as anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions/seizures, pain and other mental disorders. These 
types of medicines will reduce your alertness levels making it dangerous for you to drive 
and use machines. They may also cause central nervous system depression, which is very 
serious. Below is a list of examples of these types of medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>other opioid containing medicines such as methadone, certain pain killers and 
cough suppressants </li>
<li>some anti-depressants (used to treat depression) such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, 
selegiline, tranylcypromine, valproate and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may 
increase the effects of this medicine </li>
<li>sedative H  receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as 
diphenhydramine and chlorphenamine </li>
<li>barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital </li>
<li>tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate </li>
<li>clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) and related medicines may extend the 
effects of this medicine </li>
<li>anti-retrovirals (used to treat HIV) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase 
the effects of this medicine </li>
<li>some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole 
and certain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine </li>
<li>some medicines may decrease the effect of Zubsolv. These include medicines used to 
treat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin), and medicines used to treat 
tuberculosis (rifampicin) </li>
</ul>
<p>Zubsolv with food, drink and alcohol 
Alcohol may increase drowsiness and may increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with 
Zubsolv. Do not take Zubsolv together with alcohol. Do not swallow or consume food or any 
drink until the tablet is completely dissolved. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The risks of using Zubsolv in pregnant women are not known. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or 
intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will decide if your treatment should be continued with an 
alternative medicine. 
When taken during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, medicines like Zubsolv may cause drug 
withdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. This may appear 
several days after birth. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, since Zubsolv passes into breast milk. Ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zubsolv may cause drowsiness, dizziness or impair your thinking. This may happen more often in 
the first few weeks of treatment when your dose is being changed, but can also happen if you drink 
alcohol or take other sedative medicines when you take Zubsolv. Do not drive, use any tools or 
machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how this medicine affects you. </p>
<p>Zubsolv contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

dose should not exceed 17.2 mg of buprenorphine. </p>
<p>Clear signs of withdrawal should be evident before taking your first dose of Zubsolv. A doctor s 
assessment of your readiness for treatment will guide the timing of your first Zubsolv dose. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Starting treatment of Zubsolv whilst dependent on heroin:

<p>Dose adjustment and maintenance therapy 
Your doctor may increase the dose of Zubsolv you take according to your needs. If you feel that 
the effect of Zubsolv is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. The maximum 
daily dose is 17.2 mg. </p>
<p>After a period of successful treatment, you may agree with your doctor to reduce the dose gradually 
to a lower maintenance dose. </p>
<p>Stopping treatment 
Do not change the treatment in any way or stop treatment without the agreement of the doctor who
