<p>This medicine stimulates your body s own immune system to produce natural substances which help 
fight your actinic keratosis.  </p>
<p>Actinic keratosis appears as rough areas of skin found in people who have been exposed to a lot of 
sunshine over the course of their lifetime. These areas can be the same colour as your skin or are 
greyish, pink, red or brown. They can be flat and scaly, or raised, rough, hard and warty. </p>

that it is the most appropriate treatment for you. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to imiquimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Zyclara: 
* if you have previously used this medicine or other similar preparations in a different 
concentration.<br />
<em> if you suffer from autoimmune disorders<br />
</em> if you have had an organ transplant 
* if you have an abnormal blood count. </p>
<p>General instructions during treatment </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have recently had surgery or medicinal treatment, wait until the area to be treated has 
healed before using this medicine. </li>
<li>Avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nostrils. In the event of accidental contact, remove cream 
by rinsing with water. </li>
<li>Only use the cream externally (on the skin of face or scalp). </li>
<li>Do not use more cream than your doctor has advised. </li>
<li>Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings after you have applied this 
medicine. </li>
<li>If the treated site becomes too uncomfortable, wash the cream off with mild soap and water. 
Once the discomfort stops you can resume your treatment schedule as recommended. The 
cream should not be applied more than once daily. </li>
<li>Do not use sunlamps or tanning-beds, and avoid exposure to sunlight as much as possible 
during treatment with this medicine. If you go outside during the day use sunscreen and wear 
protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat. </li>
</ul>
<p>Local skin reactions </p>
<p>While using Zyclara, you may experience local skin reactions because of the way it acts on your skin. 
These reactions can be a sign that the medicine is working as intended. </p>
<p>Whilst using Zyclara and until healed, the treatment area is likely to appear noticeably different from 
normal skin. There is also a possibility that existing inflammation may temporarily worsen. 
This medicine may also cause flu-like symptoms (including tiredness, nausea, fever, muscle and joint 
pain, and shivering) before or during the occurrence of local skin reactions.<br />
If flu-like symptoms or feeling discomfort or intense local skin reactions occur, a rest period of several 
days may be taken. You could resume treatment with imiquimod cream after the skin reaction has 
moderated. However, neither 2-week treatment cycle should be extended due to missed doses or rest 
periods.<br />
The intensity of the local skin reactions tend to be lower in the second cycle than in the first treatment 
cycle with Zyclara. </p>
<p>Response to treatment cannot be adequately assessed until resolution of local skin reactions. You 
should continue treatment as prescribed. 
This medicine may reveal and treat actinic keratosis that have not be seen or felt before, and these may 
later go away. You should continue application for the full treatment course even if all actinic 
keratosis appear to be gone. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine should not be given to children below the age of 18 years because the safety and 
efficacy in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. There are no data available of 
the use of imiquimod in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zyclara </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If you receive immunosuppressive medicinal products which inhibit the immune system, tell your 
doctor before starting the treatment. 
Avoid the concomitant use of Zyclara and any other imiquimod cream in the same treatment area. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of using Zyclara during pregnancy. Studies in animals 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects in pregnancy.  </p>
<p>It is not known whether imiquimod passes into breast milk. You should not use Zyclara if you are 
breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. Your doctor will discuss if you should discontinue breast-feeding 
or discontinue Zyclara treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Zyclara contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate, propyl parahydroxybenzoate, cetyl alcohol, 
stearyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol </p>
<p>Methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 218), and propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E 216), may cause allergic 
reactions (possibly delayed). Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. 
contact dermatitis).<br />
This medicine contains 5 mg benzyl alcohol in each sachet. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions and mild local irritation. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Seek medical attention right away if any of these severe side effects occur when using this medicine: </p>
<p>Serious skin reactions (frequency not known) with skin lesions or spots on your skin that start out as

you notice any change during treatment with Zyclara, tell your doctor.
