  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Zydelig is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance idelalisib. It works by blocking the 
effects of an enzyme involved in multiplication and survival of certain white blood cells called 
lymphocytes. Because this enzyme is overactivated in certain cancerous white blood cells, by blocking 
it, Zydelig will kill and reduce the number of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Zydelig may be used for the treatment of two different cancers in adults: </p>
<p>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia </p>
<p>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called B-lymphocytes. 
In this disease, the lymphocytes multiply too quickly and live for too long, so that there are too many 
of them circulating in the blood. </p>
<p>In CLL Zydelig treatment is used in combination with another medicine (rituximab) in patients who 
have certain high-risk factors or in patients whose cancer has come back after at least one previous 
treatment. </p>
<p>Follicular lymphoma </p>
<p>Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called B-lymphocytes. In follicular 
lymphoma, the B-lymphocytes multiply too quickly and live for too long, so there are too many of 
them in the lymph nodes. In FL Zydelig is used on its own in patients whose cancer has not responded 
to treatment with two previous cancer treatments. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to idelalisib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
  Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Zydelig. Tell your doctor: 
* if you have liver problems 
* if you have any other medical conditions or illness (especially an infection or fever) </p>
<p>Serious and fatal infections have occurred in patients taking Zydelig. You should take additional 
medicine provided by your doctor while you are taking Zydelig to prevent one type of infection. Your 
doctor will monitor you for evidence of infection. Tell your doctor right away if you become ill 
(especially with a fever, cough or breathing difficulties) while you are taking Zydelig. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: memory loss, trouble thinking, 
difficulty walking or sight loss   these may be due to a very rare but serious brain infection which can 
be fatal (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or PML). </p>
<p>You will need regular blood tests before and during treatment with Zydelig. This is to check that you 
do not have an infection, that your liver is working properly, and that your blood counts are normal. If 
necessary, your doctor may decide to stop treatment for a while, before starting treatment again at the 
same or a lower dose. Your doctor may also decide to permanently stop treatment with Zydelig. </p>
<p>Zydelig can cause severe diarrhoea. Tell your doctor right away at the first sign of diarrhoea. </p>
<p>Zydelig can cause lung inflammation. Tell your doctor right away: 
* if you have a new or worsening cough 
* if you have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing </p>
<p>Severe skin blistering conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in 
association with idelalisib treatment. Stop using idelalisib and seek medical attention immediately if 
you notice any of the symptoms described in section 4. Tell your doctor right away: 
* if you have redness and blistering of the skin 
* if you have swelling and blistering of the lining of the mouth, throat, nose, genitals, and/or eyes </p>
<p>Laboratory tests may show an increase in white blood cells (called  lymphocytes ) in your blood in 
the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This generally does 
not mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood counts before or 
during treatment with Zydelig and in rare cases they may need to give you another medicine. Talk to 
your doctor about what your test results mean. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been 
studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zydelig </p>
<p>Zydelig should not be used with any other medicines unless your doctor has told you it is safe to 
do so. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is 
extremely important, as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken their 
effect. </p>
<p>Taking Zydelig with certain medicines may stop them working properly, or may make side effects 
worse. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>alfuzosin, a medicine used to treat an enlarged prostate </li>

<p>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about any of your medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>Zydelig should not be used during pregnancy. There is no information about the safety of this 
medicine in pregnant women. </li>
<li>Use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are being 
treated with Zydelig, and for 1 month after your last treatment. </li>
<li>Zydelig may make the contraceptive  pill  and implanted hormonal contraceptives work 
less well. You must also use a barrier method of contraception such as condoms or the  coil<br />
while taking Zydelig and for 1 month after your last treatment. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant. </li>
</ul>
<p>You should not breast-feed while taking Zydelig. If you are currently breast-feeding, talk to your 
doctor before starting treatment. It is not known whether the active substance in Zydelig passes into 
human milk. </p>
