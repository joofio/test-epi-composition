Zykadia is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance ceritinib. It is used to treat adults with 
advanced stages of a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Zykadia is only 
given to patients whose disease is due to a defect in a gene called ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). </p>
<p>How Zykadia works 
In patients with ALK defects, an abnormal protein is produced that stimulates the growth of the cancer 
cells. Zykadia blocks the action of this abnormal protein and thus slows down the growth and spread 
of NSCLC. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Zykadia works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
