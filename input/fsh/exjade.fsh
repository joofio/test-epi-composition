  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What EXJADE is 
EXJADE contains an active substance called deferasirox. It is an iron chelator which is a medicine 
used to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). It traps and removes excess 
iron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. </p>
<p>What EXJADE is used for 
Repeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example 
thalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)). However, repeated blood 
transfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. This is because blood contains iron and your body 
does not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. In 
patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over 
time, mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. Over 
time, the excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. Medicines called iron 
chelators are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. </p>
<p>EXJADE is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with 
beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. </p>
<p>EXJADE is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by infrequent blood 
transfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to 5 years. </p>
<p>EXJADE is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat patients 
aged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, but who 
are not transfusion dependent. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take EXJADE 
- if you are allergic to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If this applies to you, tell your doctor before taking EXJADE. If you think you 
may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
- if you have moderate or severe kidney disease. 
- if you are currently taking any other iron chelator medicines. </p>
<p>EXJADE is not recommended 
- if you are at an advanced stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; decreased production of 
blood cells by the bone marrow) or have advanced cancer. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking EXJADE:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a kidney or liver problem. </li>
<li>if you have a cardiac problem due to iron overload. </li>
<li>if you notice a marked decrease in your urine output (sign of kidney problem). </li>
<li>if you develop a severe rash, or difficulty breathing and dizziness or swelling mainly of the face 
and throat (signs of severe allergic reaction, see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </li>
<li>if you experience a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of 
the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes 
(signs of severe skin reaction, see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </li>
<li>if you experience a combination of drowsiness, upper right abdominal pain, yellowing or 
increased yellowing of your skin or eyes and dark urine (signs of liver problems). </li>
<li>if you experience difficulty thinking, remembering information, or solving problems, being less 
alert or aware or feeling very sleepy with low energy (signs of a high level of ammonia in your 
blood, which may be associated with liver or renal problems, see also section 4  Possible side 
effects ). </li>
<li>if you vomit blood and/or have black stools. </li>
<li>if you experience frequent abdominal pain, particularly after eating or taking EXJADE. </li>
<li>if you experience frequent heartburn. </li>
<li>if you have a low level of platelets or white blood cells in your blood test. </li>
<li>if you have blurred vision </li>
<li>if you have diarrhoea or vomiting. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. </li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring your EXJADE treatment 
You will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment. These will monitor the amount of iron in 
your body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well EXJADE is working. The tests will also monitor 
your kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver function 
(blood level of transaminases). Your doctor may require you to undergo a kidney biopsy, if he/she 
suspects significant kidney damage. You may also have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests to 
determine the amount of iron in your liver. Your doctor will take these tests into consideration when 
deciding on the dose of EXJADE most suitable for you and will also use these tests to decide when 
you should stop taking EXJADE. </p>
<p>Your eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure. </p>
<p>Other medicines and EXJADE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>other iron chelators, which must not be taken with EXJADE, </li>
<li>antacids (medicines used to treat heartburn) containing aluminium, which should not be taken at 
the same time of day as EXJADE, </li>
<li>ciclosporin (used to prevent the body rejecting a transplanted organ or for other conditions, such 
as rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), </li>
<li>simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol), </li>
<li>certain painkillers or anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids), </li>
<li>oral bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis), </li>
<li>anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent or treat blood clotting), </li>
<li>hormonal contraceptive agents (birth control medicines), </li>
<li>bepridil, ergotamine (used for heart problems and migraines), </li>
<li>repaglinide (used to treat diabetes), </li>
<li>rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis), </li>
<li>phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy), </li>
<li>ritonavir (used in the treatment of HIV infection), </li>
<li>paclitaxel (used in cancer treatment), </li>
<li>theophylline (used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma), </li>
<li>clozapine (used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia), </li>
<li>tizanidine (used as a muscle relaxant), </li>
<li>cholestyramine (used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood), </li>
<li>busulfan (used as a treatment prior to transplantation in order to destroy the original bone 
marrow before the transplant), </li>
<li>midazolam (used to relieve anxiety and/or trouble sleeping). </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional tests may be required to monitor the blood levels of some of these medicines. </p>
<p>Older people (age 65 years and over) 
EXJADE can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. Elderly 
patients may experience more side effects (in particular diarrhoea) than younger patients. They should 
be monitored closely by their doctor for side effects that may require a dose adjustment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
EXJADE can be used in children and adolescents receiving regular blood transfusions aged 2 years 
and over and in children and adolescents not receiving regular blood transfusions aged 10 years and 
over. As the patient grows the doctor will adjust the dose. </p>
<p>EXJADE is not recommended for children aged under 2 years. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>EXJADE is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. </p>
<p>If you are currently using a hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, you should use an additional 
or different type of contraception (e.g. condom), as EXJADE may reduce the effectiveness of 
hormonal contraceptives. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EXJADE. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you feel dizzy after taking EXJADE, do not drive or operate any tools or machines until you are 
feeling normal again. </p>
<p>EXJADE contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially  sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much EXJADE to take 
The dose of EXJADE is related to body weight for all patients. Your doctor will calculate the dose you 
need and tell you how many tablets to take each day. 
* The usual daily dose for EXJADE film-coated tablets at the start of the treatment for patients 
receiving regular blood transfusions is 14 mg per kilogram body weight. A higher or lower 
starting dose may be recommended by your doctor based on your individual treatment needs. 
* The usual daily dose for EXJADE film-coated tablets at the start of the treatment for patients 
not receiving regular blood transfusions is 7 mg per kilogram body weight. 
* Depending on how you respond to treatment, your doctor may later adjust your treatment to a 
higher or lower dose. 
* The maximum recommended daily dose for EXJADE film-coated tablets is: 
* 28 mg per kilogram body weight for patients receiving regular blood transfusions, 
* 14 mg per kilogram body weight for adult patients not receiving regular blood 
transfusions, 
* 7 mg per kilogram body weight for children and adolescents not receiving regular blood 
transfusions. </p>
<p>In some countries, deferasirox may also be available as dispersible tablets, made by other 
manufacturers. If you are switching from such dispersible tablets to EXJADE film-coated tablets, your 
dose will change. Your doctor will calculate the dose you need and tell you how many film-coated 
tablets to take each day. </p>
<p>When to take EXJADE 
* Take EXJADE once a day, every day, at about the same time each day with some water. 
* Take EXJADE film-coated tablets either on an empty stomach or with a light meal. 
Taking EXJADE at the same time each day will also help you remember when to take your tablets. </p>
<p>For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, EXJADE film-coated tablets may be crushed 
and taken by sprinkling the full dose onto soft food such as yogurt or apple sauce (pureed apple). The 
food should be immediately and completely consumed. Do not store it for future use. </p>
<p>How long to take EXJADE 
Continue taking EXJADE every day for as long as your doctor tells you. This is a long-term 
treatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to 
check that the treatment is having the desired effect (see also section 2:  Monitoring your EXJADE 
treatment ). </p>
<p>If you have questions about how long to take EXJADE, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you take more EXJADE than you should 
If you have taken too much EXJADE, or if someone else accidentally takes your tablets, contact your 
doctor or hospital for advice straight away. Show the doctor the pack of tablets. Urgent medical 
treatment may be necessary. You may experience effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea 
and vomiting and kidney or liver problems that can be serious. </p>
<p>If you forget to take EXJADE 
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember on that day. Take your next dose as scheduled. Do 
not take a double dose on the next day to make up for the forgotten tablet(s). </p>
<p>If you stop taking EXJADE 
Do not stop taking EXJADE unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop taking it, the excess iron will 
no longer be removed from your body (see also above section  How long to take EXJADE ). </p>         </div>"""
