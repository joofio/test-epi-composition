ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). </li>
<li>if you are pregnant and need a local anaesthetic to be injected at the top of the vagina by the 
cervix. Bupivacaine may seriously harm the unborn baby if it is used for this purpose. </li>
<li>into a blood vessel or into your joints. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>EXPAREL liposomal should not be used in large abdominal, blood vessel and chest surgeries. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before being given EXPAREL liposomal: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a heart problem; </li>
<li>if you have liver or kidney problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>EXPAREL liposomal use may cause temporary loss of sensation or movement. You may notice a 
difference in your ability to feel things or move normally for up to 5 days after being given the 
medicine.  </p>
<p>The following conditions have sometimes been reported with use of other local anaesthetics: </p>
<ul>
<li>Allergic reactions </li>
</ul>
<p>Allergic reactions may rarely occur after being given any local anaesthetic. Signs of allergic 
reactions to look out for include: hives or skin rash, swelling around the eyes, face, lips, mouth 
or throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, feeling dizzy or fainting, or fever. Seek 
urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms after being given EXPAREL 
liposomal as in rare cases these reactions can become life-threatening (see also section 4 of this 
leaflet).  </p>
<ul>
<li>Neurological conditions </li>
</ul>
<p>Toxicity of the central nervous system can also sometimes occur. Early signs of this can 
include: restlessness, anxiety, difficulty speaking, lightheadedness, feeling sick (nausea) or 
being sick (vomiting), numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, tinnitus 
(i.e. ringing in the ears), dizziness, blurred vision, tremors or twitching, depression, drowsiness. 
Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms after being given 
EXPAREL liposomal. More serious side effects from being given too much bupivacaine include 
fits (convulsions), loss of consciousness and heart attack (see also section 4 of this leaflet).  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiovascular conditions </li>
</ul>
<p>Cardiovascular conditions can also sometimes occur after use of local anaesthetics. Signs to 
look out for include: abnormal/irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, fainting, dizziness or 
lightheadedness, fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, or chest pain. Heart attack can also 
sometimes occur. Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms after 
being given EXPAREL liposomal (see also section 4 of this leaflet). </p>
<ul>
<li>Methaemoglobinamia </li>
</ul>
<p>Methaemoglobinamia is a blood disorder affecting the red blood cells. This condition can occur 
immediately or a few hours after use of local anaesthetics. Signs and symptoms to look out for 
include: pale or grey/blue skin, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded or fainting, confusion, 
palpitations, or chest pain. Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any of these symptoms 
after being given EXPAREL liposomal. Sometimes methaemoglobinamia can cause more 
serious symptoms such as irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma and even death (see also section 4 
of this leaflet).  </p>
<ul>
<li>Chondrolysis </li>
</ul>
<p>Chondrolysis (breakdown of cartilage in bone joints) has been noticed in patients receiving 
intra-articular infusion of local anaesthetics. Exparel liposomal must not be used for intra-
articular infusion. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>EXPAREL liposomal is not for use in children under 6 years of age to reduce pain in small- to 
medium-sized wounds following surgery . This medicine has not been studied in this age group.<br />
EXPAREL liposomal is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age to reduce pain in 
a specific part of the body following surgery (such as knee or shoulder joint surgery) . This medicine 
has not been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and EXPAREL liposomal </p>

<li>Local anaesthetics - benzocaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine, tetracaine, prilocaine, 
procaine, articaine, ropivacaine; </li>
<li>Anti-arrhythmic - medicines used to treat an uneven heart beat (arrhythmia), such as lidocaine 
and mexiletine; </li>
<li>Anti-cancer medicines - cyclophosphamide, flutamide, rasburicase, isofamide, hydroxyurea; </li>
<li>Antibiotics - dapsone, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid; </li>
<li>Antimalarials - chloroquine, primaquine, quinine; </li>
<li>Anticonvulsants - phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbital; </li>
<li>Other medicines   acetaminophen (paracetamol), metoclopramide (for stomach problems and 
anti-sickness), sulfasalazine (for inflammatory conditions), povidone iodine (topical antiseptic). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in doubt about any of these medicines, ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>EXPAREL liposomal is NOT recommended for pregnant women and women of childbearing-age who 
are not using contraception. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, tell your doctor or nurse before being given this medicine.  </p>
<p>EXPAREL liposomal passes into breast milk at very low levels and could cause serious adverse 
reactions in your baby. Ask your doctor for advice before breastfeeding your baby. They will decide if 
you should stop breastfeeding your baby or if you should not be given this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>EXPAREL liposomal may affect your ability to feel things or move normally for up to 5 days after 
being given the medicine. You should not drive or use tools or machines if you have any of these side 
effects. </p>
<p>EXPAREL liposomal contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 21 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10 mL vial, and 
42 mg in each 20 mL vial. This is equivalent to 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively, of the recommended 
maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""
