Extavia is a type of medicine known as interferon used to treat multiple sclerosis. Interferons are 
proteins produced by the body that help it fight against attacks on the immune system such as viral 
infections. </p>
<p>How Extavia works 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), 
particularly the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. In MS, inflammation destroys the protective 
sheath (called myelin) around the nerves of the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This 
is called demyelination. </p>
<p>The exact cause of MS is unknown. An abnormal response by the body’s immune system is thought to 
play an important part in the process which damages the CNS. </p>
<p>The damage to the CNS can occur within an MS attack (relapse). It can cause temporary disability, 
such as difficulty walking. Symptoms may disappear completely or partly. </p>
<p>Interferon beta-1b has been shown to change the response of the immune system and to help to reduce 
disease activity. </p>
<p>How Extavia helps fight your disease 
Single clinical event indicating a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis: Extavia has been 
shown to delay progression to definite multiple sclerosis. </p>
<p>Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: People with relapsing-remitting MS have occasional attacks 
or relapses during which symptoms become noticeably worse. Extavia has been shown to cut down the 
number of attacks and make them less severe. It reduces the number of hospital stays due to the 
disease and prolongs the time without relapses. </p>
<p>Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: In some cases people with relapsing-remitting MS find 
that their symptoms increase and they progress to another form of MS called secondary progressive 
MS. With this, people find themselves becoming increasingly impaired, whether or not they have 
relapses. Extavia can reduce the number and severity of the attacks, and slow the progression of 
disability. </p>
<p>What Extavia is used for 
Extavia is for use in patients<br />
► 
who have experienced for the first time symptoms which indicate a high risk of developing 
multiple sclerosis. Your doctor will rule out any other reasons which could explain these 
symptoms before you are treated. 
► 
who suffer from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with at least two relapses within 
the last two years. 
► 
who suffer from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease shown by 
relapses. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human albumin or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
- if you currently suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts (see “Warnings and 
precautions” and section 4, “Possible side effects”). 
- if you have a severe liver disease (see “Warnings and precautions”, “Other medicines and 
Extavia” and section 4, “Possible side effects”). </p>
<p>► 
Tell your doctor, if any of the above applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Extavia: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have monoclonal gammopathy. This is a disorder of the immune system where an 
abnormal protein is found in the blood. Problems with your small blood vessels (capillaries) 
may develop (systemic capillary leak syndrome) when using medicines like Extavia. This can 
lead to shock (collapse) and even be fatal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have had depression or are depressed or previously had thoughts of suicide. Your 
doctor will closely monitor you during treatment. If your depression and/or suicidal thoughts are 
severe, you will not be prescribed Extavia (see also “Do not use Extavia”). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have ever had seizures or if you are taking medicines to treat epilepsy (anti-
epileptics), you doctor will monitor your treatment carefully (see also “Other medicines and 
Extavia” and section 4, “Possible side effects”). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have severe kidney problems, your doctor may monitor your kidney function during 
treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. The tip cap of the pre-filled syringe 
contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. Therefore, the tip cap may contain natural rubber 
latex. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor also needs to know the following whilst you are using Extavia: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face 
and/or your tongue or sudden shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of a serious 
allergic reaction, which may become life threatening. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with Extavia, or if 
you develop thoughts of suicide. If you become depressed while you are on Extavia, you may 
need special treatment and your doctor will closely monitor you and may also consider stopping 
your treatment. If you suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts, you will not be 
treated with Extavia (see also “Do not use Extavia”). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be 
catching a lot of infections. These may be symptoms of a fall in your blood cell count or in the 
number of platelets in your blood (cells, which help the blood to clot). You may need extra 
monitoring by your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you experience loss of appetite, tiredness, feeling sick (nausea), repeated vomiting, and 
especially if you notice widespread itching, yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the 
eyes, or easy bruising. These symptoms may suggest problems with your liver. Changes to 
liver function values occurred in patients treated with Extavia during clinical studies. As for 
other beta interferons, severe liver damage, including cases of liver failure, have been reported 
rarely in patients taking Extavia. The most serious were reported in patients taking other 
medicines or who were suffering from diseases that can affect the liver (e.g. alcohol abuse, 
severe infection). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you experience symptoms such as irregular heartbeat, swelling such as of the ankles or 
legs, or shortness of breath. This may suggest a disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) 
which has been reported in patients using Extavia. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back, and/or you feel sick or 
have a fever. This may suggest an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which has been 
reported with Extavia use. This is often associated with an increase in certain blood fats 
(triglycerides). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>► 
Stop using Extavia and tell your doctor immediately if any of these happens to you. </p>
<p>Other things to consider when using Extavia: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will need blood tests to determine your blood cell count, blood chemistry and your liver 
enzymes. These will be performed before you start using Extavia, regularly after treatment 
with Extavia has been initiated and then periodically during treatment, even if you have no 
particular symptoms. These blood tests will be in addition to the tests which are normally done 
to monitor your MS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a heart disease, the flu-like symptoms which often occur at the start of 
treatment may prove stressful to you. Extavia must be used with caution, and your doctor will 
monitor you for worsening of your heart condition, particularly at the start of treatment. Extavia 
itself does not affect the heart directly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The functioning of your thyroid gland will be checked regularly or whenever thought 
necessary by your doctor for other reasons. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extavia contains human albumin and therefore carries a potential risk for transmission of 
viral diseases. A risk of transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be ruled out. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During treatment with Extavia your body may produce substances called neutralising 
antibodies, which may react with Extavia. It is not yet clear whether these neutralising 
antibodies reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Neutralising antibodies are not produced in 
all patients. Currently it is not possible to predict which patients belong to this group. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During treatment with Extavia, kidney problems that may reduce your kidney function, 
including scarring (glomerulosclerosis), may occur. Your doctor may perform tests to check 
your kidney function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots 
could affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting 
Extavia. Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the 
function of your kidneys. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pale or yellow skin or dark-coloured urine, possibly accompanied by unusual dizziness, 
tiredness or shortness of breath may occur during your treatment. These may be symptoms 
of a breakdown of red blood cells. This might happen several weeks to several years after 
starting Extavia. Your doctor may perform blood tests. Inform your doctor about other 
medicines that you are taking at the same time as Extavia. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Injection site reactions 
During Extavia treatment you are likely to experience injection site reactions. Symptoms include 
redness, swelling, change in skin colour, inflammation, pain, and hypersensitivity. Infection around 
the injection site and skin breakdown and tissue damage (necrosis) are reported less frequently. 
Injection site reactions usually become less frequent over time. </p>
<p>Injection site skin and tissue breakdown can result in scars forming. If this is severe a doctor may have 
to remove foreign matter and dead tissue (debridement) and, less often, skin grafting is required and 
healing may take up to 6 months. </p>
<p>To reduce the risk of getting injection site reactions, such as an infection or necrosis, you must: 
− 
use a sterile (aseptic) injection technique, 
− 
rotate the injection sites with each injection (see Annex Self-Injection procedure). </p>
<p>Injection site reactions may occur less frequently if you use an auto-injector device and by rotating 
injection sites. Your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this. </p>
<p>If you experience any break in the skin, associated with swelling or fluid leaking out from the 
injection site: </p>
<p>► 
Stop injecting Extavia and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>► 
If you have only one sore injection site (lesion) and the tissue damage (necrosis) is not too 
extensive you may continue using Extavia. </p>
<p>► 
If you have more than one sore injection sites (multiple lesions) you must stop using Extavia 
until your skin has healed. </p>
<p>Your doctor will regularly check the way you inject yourself, particularly if you have experienced 
injection site reactions. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There have been no formal clinical trials undertaken in children or adolescents. 
However, there are some data available in adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years which suggest that the 
safety of Extavia in this group is the same as in adults. Extavia should not be used in children under 
12 years of age as there is no information available for this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Extavia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>No formal interaction studies have been carried out to find out whether Extavia affects other 
medicines or is affected by them. </p>
<p>Using Extavia with other medicines that modify the immune system response is not recommended, 
except anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids or the adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH). </p>
<p>Extavia should be used with caution with: 
- medicines which need a certain liver enzyme system (known as cytochrome P450 system) for 
their removal from the body, for example medicines used to treat epilepsy (such as phenytoin). 
- medicines which affect the production of blood cells. </p>
<p>Extavia with food and drink 
Extavia is injected under the skin so any food or drink you consume is not thought to have any effect 
on Extavia. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Extavia can be used during 
breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Extavia may cause side effects in the central nervous system (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). If 
you are especially sensitive, this might influence your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Extavia contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium-
free'. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is every other day (once every two days), 1.0 ml of the prepared Extavia 
solution (see Annex “Self-injection procedure” in the second part of this leaflet) injected under the 
skin (subcutaneously). This equals 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) interferon beta-1b. </p>
<p>In general, treatment should be started at a low dose of 0.25 ml (62.5 microgram). Your doses will 
then be increased gradually to the full dose of 1.0 ml (250 microgram). 
The dose should be increased at every fourth injection in four steps (0.25 ml, 0.5 ml, 0.75 ml, 1.0 ml). 
Your doctor may decide together with you to change the time intervals for dose increase depending on 
side effects you may experience at the start of treatment. </p>
<p>Preparing the injection 
Before injection, the Extavia solution has to be prepared from a vial of Extavia powder and 1.2 ml 
of liquid from the pre-filled solvent syringe. This will either be done by your doctor or nurse or by 
yourself after you have been carefully trained. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions for self-injection of Extavia under the skin are provided in the Annex at the 
back of this leaflet. These instructions also tell you how to prepare the Extavia solution for injection. </p>
<p>The injection site must be changed regularly. See section 2 “Warnings and precautions” and follow 
the instructions under “Rotating injection sites” in the Annex at the back of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
At present it is not known how long treatment with Extavia should last. The length of treatment will 
be decided by your doctor together with you. </p>
<p>If you use more Extavia than you should 
Giving many times the dose of Extavia recommended for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not 
led to life-threatening situations. </p>
<p>► 
Talk to your doctor if you inject too much Extavia or injected too often. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Extavia 
If you have forgotten to give yourself an injection at the right time do it as soon as you remember and 
then follow on with the next one 48 hours later. </p>
<p>Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Extavia 
Talk to your doctor if you stop or wish to stop treatment. Stopping Extavia is not known to cause acute 
withdrawal symptoms. </p>

Injection site reactions. Symptoms can be redness, swelling, discolouration, inflammation, 
infection, pain, hypersensitivity, tissue damage (necrosis). See “Warnings and precautions” in 
section 2 for more information and what to do if you experience an injection site reaction. These 
may be reduced by the use of an auto-injector device and by rotating injection sites. Talk to 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for further information. </p>
<p>To reduce the risk of side effects at the start of treatment, your doctor should start you on a low dose
