<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Fabrazyme. </p>
<p>If you are treated with Fabrazyme, you may develop infusion associated reactions. An infusion-
associated reaction is any side effect occurring during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day 
(see section 4). If you experience a reaction like this, you should tell your doctor immediately. You 
may need to be given additional medicines to prevent such reactions from occurring. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
No clinical studies have been performed in children 0-4 years old. The risks and benefits of 
Fabrazyme in children aged 5 to 7 years have not yet been established and therefore no dose can be 
recommended for this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fabrazyme 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you use any medicines containing chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or 
gentamicin. There is a theoretical risk of decreased agalsidase beta activity.   </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Use of Fabrazyme during pregnancy is not recommended. There is no experience with the use of 
Fabrazyme in pregnant women. Fabrazyme may get into breast milk. Use of Fabrazyme during breast-
feeding is not recommended. Studies have not been performed to examine the effects of Fabrazyme 
on fertility. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you experience dizziness, sleepiness, vertigo or fainting during or 
shortly after administration of Fabrazyme (see section 4). Talk to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Fabrazyme contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
