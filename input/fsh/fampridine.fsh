Sclerosis (MS) related walking disability. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective 
sheath around the nerves leading to muscle weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty walking.  </p>
<p>Fampridine Accord contains the active substance fampridine which belongs to a group of medicines 
called potassium channel blockers. They work by stopping potassium leaving the nerve cells which 
have been damaged by MS. This medicine is thought to work by letting signals pass down the nerve 
more normally, which allows you to walk better. </p>         </div>"""
