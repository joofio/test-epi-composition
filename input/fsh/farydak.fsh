another medicine that you have not already been taking. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Pregnancy

than the potential risk to the baby. If you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or plan to become 
pregnant, ask your doctor for advice. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking 
Farydak during pregnancy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breast-feeding

If you are a sexually active woman, you should have a pregnancy test before starting Farydak 
treatment and you must use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment with Farydak. 
You must also use this for three months after you have stopped taking Farydak. Your doctor will 
discuss with you which is the best method for you to use. If you use a hormonal contraceptive you 
must also use a barrier method of contraception (such as condom or diaphragm) in addition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For men taking Farydak 
If you are a sexually active man, you should use condoms during treatment with Farydak. You should 
also do this for six months after you have stopped taking Farydak. If your partner is able to become 
pregnant she should also use a highly effective method of contraception during your treatment and for 
six months after. Tell your doctor straight away if your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking 
Farydak or during the six months following your treatment with Farydak. </p>
</li>
</ul>
