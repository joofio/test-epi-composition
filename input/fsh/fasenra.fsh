  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Fasenra is
Fasenra contains the active substance benralizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
that recognises and attaches to a specific target substance in the body. The target of benralizumab is a 
protein called interleukin-5 receptor, which is found particularly on a type of white blood cell called an 
eosinophil.
What Fasenra is used for
Fasenra is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma 
where patients have too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. 
Fasenra is used together with other medicines to treat asthma (high doses of  corticosteroid inhalers 
plus other asthma medicines) when the disease is not well controlled by those other medicines alone. 
How Fasenra works
Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. By attaching to the eosinophils, 
Fasenra helps to reduce their numbers and inflammation. 
What are the benefits of using Fasenra
Fasenra may reduce the number of asthma attacks you are experiencing, help you breathe better and 
decrease your asthma symptoms. If you are taking medicines called  oral corticosteroids , using
Fasenra may also allow you to reduce the daily dose or stop the oral corticosteroids you need to 
control your asthma.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to benralizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you think this applies to you.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Fasenra:</p>
<p>if you have a parasitic infection or if you live in an area where parasitic infections are common 
or you are travelling to such a region. This medicine may weaken your ability to fight certain 
types of parasitic infections.</p>
<p>if you have had an allergic reaction to an injection or medicine in the past (see section 4 for 
symptoms of an allergic reaction).
Also, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist when you are given Fasenra:</p>
<p>if your asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine.</p>
<p>if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction (see section 4). Allergic reactions have 
occurred in patients receiving this medicine. 
Fasenra is not a rescue medicine. Do not use it to treat a sudden asthma attack.
Look out for signs of serious allergic reactions 
Fasenra can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. You must look out for signs of these reactions 
(such as hives, rash, breathing problems, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded and/or swelling of 
your face, tongue or mouth) while you are taking Fasenra.
It is important that you talk to your doctor about how to recognise early symptoms of serious allergic 
reactions and how to manage these reactions if they occur.
Other medicines for asthma
Do not suddenly stop taking or change the dose of your preventer medicines for your asthma once 
you have started Fasenra. 
If your response to the treatment allows it, your doctor may try to reduce the dose of some of these 
medicines, especially ones called  corticosteroids . This should be done gradually and under the direct 
supervision of your doctor.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 18 because the safety and benefits of this 
medicine are not known in this population. 
Other medicines and Fasenra
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines before using 
Fasenra.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Do not use Fasenra if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you otherwise. It is not known whether 
Fasenra could harm your unborn baby. 
It is not known whether the ingredients of Fasenra can pass into breast milk. If you are 
breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your doctor. 
Driving and using machines
It is unlikely that Fasenra will affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>         </div>"""

not received Fasenra previously and if you had previous allergic reaction with Fasenra.
You or your caregiver should receive training on the right way to inject Fasenra. Read the 
 Instructions for Use  for the pre-filled syringe carefully before using Fasenra.
If you forget to use Fasenra
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Fasenra, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as 
possible.
Stopping treatment with Fasenra
Do not stop treatment with Fasenra unless your doctor advises you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Fasenra may cause your asthma symptoms and attacks to come back.
If your asthma symptoms get worse while receiving injections of Fasenra, call your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
