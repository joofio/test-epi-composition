are about to receive or are receiving chemotherapy treatment.  </p>
<p>When chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, releasing large amounts of uric acid into the 
bloodstream.<br />
Fasturtec works by allowing uric acid to more easily be removed from the body by the kidneys.  </p>         </div>"""

</ul>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist if you have a history of any kind of allergy. 
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any allergic type reactions due to other medicines; Fasturtec can 
cause allergic-type reactions, such as severe anaphylaxis including anaphylactic shock (sudden life-
threatening or fatal allergic reactions).  </p>

* swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat 
* coughing or wheezing 
* difficulty in breathing or swallowing 
* rash, itching or hives (nettle-type rash) on the skin </p>
<p>These may be the first signs that a severe allergic reaction is happening. Your treatment with 
Fasturtec may need to be stopped, and you may need further treatment. 
It is not known whether the chance of developing an allergic reaction is increased if treatment with 
Fasturtec is repeated. </p>
<p>In case of disorders of the blood in which red blood cells are abnormally broken down (haemolysis) or 
abnormal blood pigment levels (methaemoglobinaemia), your doctor will immediately and 
permanently discontinue treatment with Fasturtec. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fasturtec<br />
Please tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
