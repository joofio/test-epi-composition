  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Febuxostat Viatris tablets contain the active substance febuxostat and are used to treat gout, 
which is associated with an excess of a chemical called uric acid (urate) in the body. In some 
people, the amount of uric acid builds up in the blood and may become too high to remain 
soluble. When this happens, urate crystals may form in and around the joints and kidneys. These 
crystals can cause sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint (known as a gout 
attack). Left untreated, larger deposits called tophi may form in and around joints. These tophi 
may cause joint and bone damage. </p>
<p>Febuxostat Viatris works by reducing uric acid levels. Keeping uric acid levels low by taking 
Febuxostat Viatris once every day stops crystals building up, and over time it reduces 
symptoms. Keeping uric acid levels sufficiently low for a long enough period can also shrink 
tophi. </p>
<p>Febuxostat Viatris 120 mg tablets are also used to treat and prevent high blood levels of uric 
acid that may occur when you start to receive chemotherapy for blood cancers. 
When chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, and uric acid levels increase in the 
blood accordingly, unless the formation of uric acid is prevented. </p>
<p>Febuxostat Viatris is for adults. </p>         </div>"""

* If you are allergic to febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Febuxostat Viatris: 
* If you have or have had heart failure, heart problems or stroke 
* If you have or have had renal disease and/or serious allergic reaction to allopurinol (a 
medication used for the treatment of Gout) 
* If you have or have had liver disease or liver function test abnormalities 
* If you are being treated for high uric acid levels as a result of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a 
rare inherited condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood) 
* If you have thyroid problems. </p>
<p>Should you experience allergic reactions to Febuxostat Viatris, stop taking this medicine (see 
also section 4). Possible symptoms of allergic reactions might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>rash including severe forms (e.g. blisters, nodules, itchy, exfoliative rash), itchiness </li>
<li>swelling of limbs or face </li>
<li>difficulties in breathing </li>
<li>fever with enlarged lymph nodes </li>
<li>but also serious life threatening allergic conditions with cardiac and circulatory arrest. 
Your doctor might decide to permanently stop treatment with Febuxostat Viatris. </li>
</ul>
<p>There have been rare reports of potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome) with the use of febuxostat, appearing initially as reddish target-like spots or circular 
patches often with central blister on the trunk. It may also include ulcers in the mouth, throat, 
nose, genitals and conjunctivitis (red and swollen eyes). The rash may progress to widespread 
blistering or peeling of the skin. </p>
<p>If you have developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome with the use of febuxostat, you must not be 
re-started on Febuxostat Viatris at any time. If you develop a rash or these skin symptoms, seek 
immediate advice from a doctor and tell them that you are taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are having a gout attack at the moment (a sudden onset of severe pain, tenderness, 
redness, warmth and swelling in a joint), wait for the gout attack to subside first before starting 
treatment with Febuxostat Viatris. </p>
<p>For some people, gout attacks may flare up when starting certain medicines that control uric 
acid levels. Not everyone gets flares, but you could get a flare-up even if you are taking 
Febuxostat Viatris, and especially during the first weeks or months of treatment. It is important 
to keep taking Febuxostat Viatris even if you have a flare, as Febuxostat Viatris is still working 
to lower uric acid. Over time, gout flares will occur less often and be less painful if you keep 
taking Febuxostat Viatris every day. </p>
<p>Your doctor will often prescribe other medicines, if they are needed, to help prevent or treat the 
symptoms of flares (such as pain and swelling in a joint). </p>
<p>In patients with very high urate levels (e.g. those undergoing cancer chemotherapy), treatment 
with uric acid-lowering medicines could lead to the build-up of xanthine in the urinary tract, 
with possible stones, even though this has not been observed in patients being treated with 
febuxostat for Tumor Lysis Syndrome. </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to have blood tests to check that your liver is working normally. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 18 because the safety and efficacy have 
not been established. 
Other medicines and Febuxostat Viatris </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
It is especially important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines 
containing any of the following substances as they may interact with Febuxostat Viatris and 
your doctor may wish to consider necessary measures: 
* Mercaptopurine (used to treat cancer) 
* Azathioprine (used to reduce immune response) 
* Theophylline (used to treat asthma) </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>It is not known if febuxostat may harm your unborn child. Febuxostat Viatris should not be used 
during pregnancy. It is not known if febuxostat may pass into human breast milk. You should 
not use Febuxostat Viatris if you are breast-feeding, or if you are planning to breast-feed. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Be aware that you may experience dizziness, sleepiness, blurred vision and numbness or 
tingling sensation during treatment and should not drive or operate machines if affected. </p>
<p>Febuxostat Viatris contains lactose  </p>
<p>Febuxostat Viatris tablets contain lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor 
that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Febuxostat Viatris contains sodium 
Febuxostat Viatris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Do not stop taking Febuxostat Viatris without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. 
If you stop taking Febuxostat Viatris your uric acid levels may begin to rise and your symptoms 
may worsen due to the formation of new crystals of urate in and around your joints and kidneys. </p>
