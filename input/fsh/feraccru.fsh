section 6). 
- If you have any illness causing iron overload or a disturbance in how your body uses iron. 
- If you have received multiple blood transfusions. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before starting treatment, your doctor will use a blood test to make sure that your anaemia is not 
severe or caused by anything other than iron deficiency (low iron stores). </p>
<p>You should avoid taking Feraccru if you are experiencing a “flare” of your inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). </p>
<p>You should not take Feraccru if you are taking dimercaprol (a medicine used to remove toxic metals 
from the blood), chloramphenicol (used to treat bacterial infections), or methyldopa (used to treat high 
blood pressure). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this treatment to children or adolescents 17 years and under as it has not been 
studied in this age group. Too much iron is dangerous in children, infants and toddlers and can 
be life-threatening. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Feraccru 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines. </p>

You should not be given iron by injection or infusion (intravenously) while you are taking Feraccru. </p>
</li>

If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your 
doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
