<p>if you are allergic to deferiprone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>if you have a history of repeated episodes of neutropenia (low white blood cell (neutrophil) 
count). </p>
<p>if you have a history of agranulocytosis (very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count). </p>
<p>if you are currently taking medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see  Other 
medicines and Ferriprox ). </p>
<p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>the most serious side effect that may occur while taking Ferriprox is a very low white blood cell 
(neutrophil) count. This condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has 
occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people who have taken Ferriprox in clinical studies. Because white 
blood cells help to fight infection, a low neutrophil count may place you at risk of developing a 
serious and potentially life-threatening infection. To monitor for neutropenia, your doctor will 
ask you to have a blood test (to check your white blood cell count) performed regularly, as 
frequently as every week, while you are being treated with Ferriprox. It is very important for 
you to keep all of these appointments. Please refer to the patient card attached to the carton. If </p>
<p>you get any symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms, immediately 
seek medical attention. Your white blood cell count must be checked within 24 hours in order to 
detect potential agranulocytosis. </p>
<p>if you are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or if your liver or kidney function is 
severely impaired, your doctor may recommend additional tests. </p>
<p>Your doctor will also ask you to come in for tests to monitor body iron load. In addition he or she 
might ask you to undergo liver biopsies. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ferriprox 
Do not take medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see  Do not take Ferriprox ). 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Do not take aluminium-based antacids at the same time as taking Ferriprox. </p>
<p>Please consult with your doctor or pharmacist before taking vitamin C with Ferriprox. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ferriprox may cause harm to unborn babies when used by pregnant women. Ferriprox must not be 
used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or you become pregnant during 
treatment with Ferriprox, get medical advice immediately. </p>
<p>Both female and male patients are recommended to take special precautions in their sexual activity if 
there is any possibility for pregnancy to occur: Women of childbearing potential are recommended to 
use effective contraception during treatment with Ferriprox and for 6 months after the last dose. Men 
are recommended to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. 
This should be discussed with your doctor. </p>
<p>Do not use Ferriprox if you are breast-feeding. Please refer to the patient card attached to the carton. </p>

is 25 mg/kg, 3 times per day, for a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg. The total daily dose should not exceed 
100 mg/kg. Take your first dose in the morning. Take your second dose midday. Take your third dose 
in the evening. Ferriprox can be taken with or without food; however, you may find it easier to 
remember to take Ferriprox if you take it with your meals. </p>
<p>If you take more Ferriprox than you should 
There are no reports of acute overdose with Ferriprox. If you have accidentally taken more than the 
prescribed dose, you should contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Ferriprox 
Ferriprox will be most effective if you do not miss any doses. If you do miss one dose take it as soon 
as you remember and take your next dose at its regularly scheduled time. If you miss more than one 
dose do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses, just continue with your 
normal schedule. Do not change your daily dose without first talking to your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people 
who have taken Ferriprox in clinical studies. A low white blood cell count can be associated with a

<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): </p>
<p>abdominal pain; </p>
<p>nausea; </p>
<p>vomiting; </p>
<p>reddish/brown discolouration of urine. </p>
<p>If you experience nausea or vomiting, it may help to take your Ferriprox with some food. Discoloured 
urine is a very common effect and is not harmful. </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): </p>
<p>low white blood cell count (agranulocytosis and neutropenia); </p>
<p>headache; </p>
<p>diarrhoea; </p>
<p>increase in liver enzymes; </p>

<p>increase in appetite. </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): </p>
<p>allergic reactions including skin rash or hives. </p>
<p>Events of joint pain and swelling ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe disability. In 
most cases, the pain disappeared while patients continued taking Ferriprox. </p>
<p>Neurological disorders (such as tremors, walking disorders, double vision, involuntary muscle 
contractions, problems with movement coordination) have been reported in children who had been 
voluntarily prescribed more than double the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 
several years and have also been observed in children with standard doses of deferiprone. The children 
recovered from these symptoms after Ferriprox discontinuation. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of
