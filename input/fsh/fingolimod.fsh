Fingolimod Mylan contains the active substance fingolimod. </p>
<p>What Fingolimod Mylan is used for 
Fingolimod Mylan is used in adults and in children and adolescents (10 years of age and above) to 
treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), more specifically in: 
* Patients who have failed to respond despite treatment with an MS treatment. 
or 
* Patients who have rapidly evolving severe MS. </p>
<p>Fingolimod Mylan does not cure MS, but it helps to reduce the number of relapses and to slow down 
the progression of physical disabilities due to MS. </p>
<p>What is multiple sclerosis 
MS is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), comprised of the brain and 
spinal cord. In MS inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called myelin) around the nerves in 
the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This is called demyelination. </p>
<p>Relapsing-remitting MS is characterised by repeated attacks (relapses) of nervous system symptoms 
that reflect inflammation within the CNS. Symptoms vary from patient to patient but typically involve 
walking difficulties, numbness, vision problems or disturbed balance. Symptoms of a relapse may 
disappear completely when the relapse is over, but some problems may remain. </p>
<p>How Fingolimod Mylan works 
Fingolimod Mylan helps to protect against attacks on the CNS by the immune system by reducing the 
ability of some white blood cells (lymphocytes) to move freely within the body and by stopping them 
from reaching the brain and spinal cord. This limits nerve damage caused by MS. This medicine also 
reduces some of the immune reactions of your body. </p>         </div>"""

If this applies to you or you are unsure, talk to your doctor before taking Fingolimod Mylan. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Fingolimod Mylan: 
* if you have severe breathing problems during sleep (severe sleep apnoea). 
* if you have been told you have an abnormal electrocardiogram. 
* if you suffer from symptoms of slow heart rate (e.g. dizziness, nausea, or palpitations). 
* if you are taking or have recently taken medicines that slow your heart rate (such as beta 
blockers, verapamil, diltiazem or ivabradine, digoxin, anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine). 
* if you have a history of sudden loss of consciousness or fainting (syncope). 
* if you plan to get vaccinated. 
* if you have never had chickenpox. 
* if you have or have had visual disturbances or other signs of swelling in the central vision 
area (macula) at the back of the eye (a condition known as macular oedema, see below), 
inflammation or infection of the eye (uveitis), or if you have diabetes (which can cause eye 
problems). 
* if you have liver problems. 
* if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicines. 
* if you have severe lung problems or smoker s cough. 
If any of these applies to you or you are unsure, talk to your doctor before taking Fingolimod 
Mylan. </p>
<p>Slow heart rate (bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat 
At the beginning of treatment or after taking the first dose of 0.5 mg when you switch from a 0.25 mg 
daily dose, Fingolimod Mylan causes the heart rate to slow down. As a result, you may feel dizzy or 
tired, or be consciously aware of your heartbeat, or your blood pressure may drop. If these effects are 
severe, tell your doctor, because you may need treatment right away. This medicine can also 
cause an irregular heartbeat, especially after the first dose. Irregular heartbeat usually returns to 
normal in less than one day. Slow heart rate usually returns to normal within one month. During this 
period, no clinically significant heart rate effects are usually expected. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to stay at the surgery or clinic for at least 6 hours, with hourly pulse and 
blood pressure measurements, after taking the first dose of Fingolimod Mylan or after taking the first 
dose of 0.5 mg when you switch from a 0.25 mg daily dose, so that appropriate measures can be taken 
in the event of side effects that occur at the start of treatment. You should have an electrocardiogram 
performed prior to the first dose of this medicine and after the 6-hour monitoring period. Your doctor 
may monitor your electrocardiogram continuously during that time. If after the 6-hour period you have 
a very slow or decreasing heart rate, or if your electrocardiogram shows abnormalities, you may need </p>
<p>to be monitored for a longer period (at least 2 more hours and possibly overnight) until these have 
resolved. The same may apply if you are resuming Fingolimod Mylan after a break in treatment, 
depending on both how long the break was and how long you had been taking it before the break. </p>
<p>If you have, or if you are at risk for, an irregular or abnormal heartbeat, if your electrocardiogram is 
abnormal, or if you have heart disease or heart failure, Fingolimod Mylan may not be appropriate for 
you. </p>
<p>If you have a history of sudden loss of consciousness or decreased heart rate, Fingolimod Mylan may 
not be appropriate for you. You will be evaluated by a cardiologist (heart specialist) to advise how you 
should start treatment, including overnight monitoring. </p>
<p>If you are taking medicines that can cause your heart rate to decrease, Fingolimod Mylan may not be 
appropriate for you. You will need to be evaluated by a cardiologist, who will check whether you can 
be switched to alternative medicine that does not decrease your heart rate in order to allow treatment 
with Fingolimod Mylan. If such a switch is impossible, the cardiologist will advise how you should 
start treatment with Fingolimod Mylan, including overnight monitoring. </p>
<p>If you have never had chickenpox 
If you have never had chickenpox, your doctor will check your immunity against the virus that causes 
it (varicella zoster virus). If you are not protected against the virus, you may need a vaccination before 
you start treatment with Fingolimod Mylan. If this is the case, your doctor will delay the start of 
treatment until one month after the full course of vaccination is completed. </p>
<p>Infections 
Fingolimod Mylan lowers the white blood cell count (particularly the lymphocyte count). White blood 
cells fight infection. While you are taking this medicine (and for up to 2 months after you stop taking 
it), you may get infections more easily. Any infection that you already have may get worse. Infections 
could be serious and life-threatening. If you think you have an infection, have fever, feel like you have 
the flu, have shingles or have a headache accompanied by stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea, rash 
and/or confusion or seizures (fits) (these may be symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis caused 
by a fungal or herpes viral infection), contact your doctor straight away, because it could be serious 
and life-threatening.  </p>
<p>If you believe your MS is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you notice any new 
symptoms, talk to your doctor straight away, because these may be the symptoms of a rare brain 
disorder caused by infection and called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a 
serious condition that may lead to severe disability or death. Your doctor will consider performing an 
MRI scan to evaluate this condition and will decide whether you need to stop taking fingolimod. </p>
<p>Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including papilloma, dysplasia, warts and HPV-related 
cancer, has been reported in patients treated with Fingolimod Mylan. Your doctor will consider 
whether you need to have a vaccination against HPV before starting treatment. If you are a woman, 
your doctor will also recommend HPV screening. </p>
<p>Macular oedema 
Before you start Fingolimod Mylan, if you have or have had visual disturbances or other signs of 
swelling in the central vision area (macula) at the back of the eye, inflammation or infection of the eye 
(uveitis) or diabetes, your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination. </p>
<p>Your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination 3 to 4 months after starting Fingolimod 
Mylan treatment. </p>
<p>The macula is a small area of the retina at the back of the eye which enables you to see shapes, colours 
and details clearly and sharply. Fingolimod Mylan may cause swelling in the macula, a condition that 
is known as macular oedema. The swelling usually happens in the first 4 months of treatment. </p>
<p>Your chance of developing macular oedema is higher if you have diabetes or have had an 
inflammation of the eye called uveitis. In these cases, your doctor will want you to undergo regular 
eye examinations in order to detect macular oedema. </p>
<p>If you have had macular oedema, talk to your doctor before you resume treatment with Fingolimod 
Mylan.  </p>
<p>Macular oedema can cause some of the same vision symptoms as an MS attack (optic neuritis). Early 
on, there may not be any symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor about any changes in your vision. 
Your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination, especially if: 
* the centre of your vision gets blurry or has shadows. 
* you develop a blind spot in the centre of your vision. 
* you have problems seeing colours or fine detail. </p>
<p>Liver function tests 
If you have severe liver problems, you should not take Fingolimod Mylan. It may affect your liver 
function. You will probably not notice any symptoms but if you notice yellowing of your skin or the 
whites of your eyes, abnormally dark urine (brown coloured), pain on the right side of your stomach 
area (abdomen), tiredness, feeling less hungry than usual or unexplained nausea and vomiting, tell 
your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>If you get any of these symptoms after starting Fingolimod Mylan, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Before, during and after the treatment, your doctor will request blood tests to monitor your liver 
function. If your test results indicate a problem with your liver, you may have to interrupt treatment 
with Fingolimod Mylan. </p>
<p>High blood pressure 
As Fingolimod Mylan causes a slight elevation of blood pressure, your doctor may want to check your 
blood pressure regularly. </p>
<p>Lung problems 
Fingolimod Mylan has a slight effect on the lung function. Patients with severe lung problems or with 
smoker s cough may have a higher chance of developing side effects. </p>
<p>Blood count 
The desired effect of Fingolimod Mylan treatment is to reduce the amount of white blood cells in your 
blood. This will usually go back to normal within 2 months of stopping treatment. If you need to have 
any blood tests, tell the doctor that you are taking this medicine. Otherwise, it may not be possible for 
the doctor to understand the results of the test and for certain types of blood test your doctor may need 
to take more blood than usual. </p>
<p>Before you start Fingolimod Mylan, your doctor will confirm whether you have enough white blood 
cells in your blood and may want to repeat a check regularly. In case you do not have enough white 
blood cells, you may have to interrupt treatment. </p>
<p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
A condition called PRES has been rarely reported in MS patients treated with fingolimod. Symptoms 
may include sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision changes. Tell your 
doctor straight away if you experience any of these symptoms during your treatment, because it could 
be serious. </p>
<p>Cancer 
Skin cancers have been reported in MS patients treated with fingolimod. Talk to your doctor straight 
away if you notice any skin nodules (e.g. shiny pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not heal 
within weeks. Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin tissue (e.g. 
unusual moles) with a change in colour, shape or size over time. Before you start Fingolimod Mylan, a </p>
<p>skin examination is required to check whether you have any skin nodules. Your doctor will also carry 
out regular skin examinations during your treatment. If you develop problems with your skin, your 
doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after consultation may decide that it is important for you 
to be seen on a regular basis. </p>
<p>A type of cancer of the lymphatic system (lymphoma) has been reported in MS patients treated with 
fingolimod. </p>
<p>Exposure to the sun and protection against the sun 
Fingolimod weakens your immune system. This increases your risk of developing cancers, in 
particular skin cancers. You should limit your exposure to the sun and UV rays by: 
* wearing appropriate protective clothing. 
* regularly applying sunscreen with a high degree of UV protection. </p>
<p>Unusual brain lesions associated with MS relapse<br />
Rare cases of unusually large brain lesions associated with MS relapse have been reported in patients 
treated with fingolimod. In case of severe relapse, your doctor will consider performing MRI to 
evaluate this condition and will decide whether you need to stop treatment. </p>
<p>Switch from other treatments to Fingolimod Mylan 
Your doctor may switch you directly from beta interferon, glatiramer acetate or dimethyl fumarate to 
Fingolimod Mylan if there are no signs of abnormalities caused by your previous treatment. Your 
doctor may have to do a blood test in order to exclude such abnormalities. After stopping natalizumab 
you may have to wait for 2-3 months before starting treatment with Fingolimod Mylan. To switch 
from teriflunomide, your doctor may advise you to wait for a certain time or to go through an 
accelerated elimination procedure. If you have been treated with alemtuzumab, a thorough evaluation 
and discussion with your doctor is required to decide if Fingolimod Mylan is appropriate for you. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential<br />
If used during pregnancy, Fingolimod Mylan can harm the unborn baby. Before you start treatment 
your doctor will explain the risk to you and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you 
are not pregnant. Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become 
pregnant while taking Fingolimod Mylan. It also explains what you should do to avoid becoming 
pregnant while you are taking this medicine. You must use effective contraception during treatment 
and for 2 months after stopping treatment (see section  Pregnancy and breastfeeding ). </p>
<p>Worsening of MS after stopping Fingolimod Mylan treatment<br />
Do not stop taking this medicine or change your dose without talking to your doctor first.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS is getting worse after you have stopped treatment 
with Fingolimod Mylan. This could be serious (see  If you stop taking Fingolimod Mylan  in section 
3, and also section 4,  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>Elderly 
Experience with fingolimod in elderly patients (over 65 years) is limited. Talk to your doctor if you 
have any concerns. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Fingolimod Mylan is not intended for use in children below 10 years old as it has not been studied in 
MS patients in this age group. </p>
<p>The warnings and precautions listed above also apply to children and adolescents. The following 
information is particularly important for children and adolescents and their caregivers: 
* Before you start Fingolimod Mylan, your doctor will check your vaccination status. If you have 
not had certain vaccinations, it may be necessary for you to be given them before this medicine 
can be started. 
* The first time you take Fingolimod Mylan, or when you switch from a 0.25 mg daily dose to a </p>
<p>0.5 mg daily dose, your doctor will monitor your heart rate and heartbeat (see  Slow heart rate 
(bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat  above). 
* If you experience convulsions or fits before or whilst taking Fingolimod Mylan, let your doctor 
know. 
* If you suffer from depression or anxiety or if you become depressed or anxious while you are 
taking Fingolimod Mylan, let your doctor know. You may need to be monitored more closely. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fingolimod Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* Medicines that suppress or modulate the immune system, including other medicines used 
to treat MS, such as beta interferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, 
teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab. You must not use Fingolimod Mylan 
together with such medicines as this could intensify the effect on the immune system (see also 
 Do not take Fingolimod Mylan ). 
* Corticosteroids, due to a possible added effect on the immune system. 
* Vaccines. If you need to receive a vaccine, seek your doctor s advice first. During and for up to 
2 months after treatment with Fingolimod Mylan, you should not receive certain types of 
vaccine (live attenuated vaccines) as they could trigger the infection that they were supposed to 
prevent. Other vaccines may not work as well as usual if given during this period. 
* Medicines that slow the heartbeat (for example beta blockers, such as atenolol). Use of 
Fingolimod Mylan together with such medicines could intensify the effect on heartbeat in the 
first days after starting treatment. 
* Medicines for irregular heartbeat, such as quinidine, disopyramide, amiodarone or sotalol. 
You must not use Fingolimod Mylan if you are taking such a medicine because it could 
intensify the effect on irregular heartbeat (see also  Do not take Fingolimod Mylan ). 
* Other medicines: * 
protease inhibitors, anti-infectives such as ketoconazole, azole antifungals, 
clarithromycin or telithromycin. * 
carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, efavirenz or St. John s Wort 
(Hypericum perforatum) (potential risk of reduced efficacy of Fingolimod Mylan). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not use Fingolimod Mylan during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a 
woman who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. If this medicine is 
used during pregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. The rate of congenital 
malformations observed in babies exposed to fingolimod during pregnancy is about 2 times the rate 
observed in the general population (in whom the rate of congenital malformations is about 2-3%). The 
most frequently reported malformations included cardiac, renal and musculoskeletal malformations. </p>
<p>Therefore, if you are a woman of childbearing potential: 
* before you start treatment with Fingolimod Mylan your doctor will inform you about the risk to 
an unborn baby and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant, 
and, 
* you must use effective contraception while taking this medicine and for two months after you 
stop taking it to avoid becoming pregnant. Talk to your doctor about reliable methods of 
contraception. </p>
<p>Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become pregnant while taking 
Fingolimod Mylan. </p>
<p>If you do become pregnant while taking Fingolimod Mylan, tell your doctor straight away. Your </p>
<p>doctor will decide to stop treatment (see  If you stop taking Fingolimod Mylan  in section 3, and also 
section 4,  Possible side effects ). Specialised pre-natal monitoring will be performed. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed while you are taking Fingolimod Mylan. It can pass into breast milk 
and there is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles, including a bicycle and 
use machines safely. Fingolimod Mylan is not expected to have an influence on your ability to drive 
and use machines. </p>
<p>However, at initiation of treatment you will have to stay at the doctor s surgery or clinic for 6 hours 
after taking the first dose of this medicine. Your ability to drive and use machines may be impaired 
during and potentially after this time period. </p>         </div>"""

* Reduction in blood platelets which increases risk of bleeding or bruising 
* Malignant melanoma (a type of skin cancer which usually develops from an unusual mole). 
Possible signs of melanoma include moles which may change size, shape, elevation or colour 
over time, or new moles. The moles may itch, bleed or ulcerate 
* Convulsion, fits (more frequent in children and adolescents than in adults) </p>
<p>Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
* A condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Symptoms may 
include sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and/or vision disturbances 
* Lymphoma (a type of cancer that affects the lymph system) 
* Squamous cell carcinoma: a type of skin cancer which may present as a firm red nodule, a sore 
with crust, or a new sore on an existing scar </p>
<p>Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) 
* Electrocardiogram anomaly (T-wave inversion) 
* Tumour related to infection with human herpes virus 8 (Kaposi s sarcoma) </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
* Allergic reactions, including symptoms of rash or itchy hives, swelling of lips, tongue or face, 
which are more likely to occur on the day you start Fingolimod Mylan treatment 
* Signs of liver disease (including liver failure), such as yellowing of your skin or the whites of 
your eyes (jaundice), nausea or vomiting, pain on the right side of your stomach area 
(abdomen), dark urine (brown coloured), feeling less hungry than usual, tiredness and abnormal 
liver function tests. In a very small number of cases, liver failure could lead to liver 
transplantation 
* Risk of a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The 
symptoms of PML may be similar to an MS relapse. Symptoms might also arise that you might 
not become aware of by yourself, such as changes in mood or behaviour, memory lapses, speech 
and communication difficulties, which your doctor may need to investigate further to rule out 
PML. Therefore, if you believe your MS is getting worse or if you or those close to you notice 
any new or unusual symptoms, it is very important that you speak to your doctor as soon as 
possible 
* Cryptococcal infections (a type of fungal infection), including cryptococcal meningitis with 
symptoms such as headache accompanied by stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea and/or 
confusion 
* Merkel cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer). Possible signs of Merkel cell carcinoma include 
flesh-coloured or bluish-red, painless nodule, often on the face, head or neck. Merkel cell 
carcinoma can also present as a firm painless nodule or mass. Long-term exposure to the sun 
and a weak immune system can affect the risk of developing Merkel cell carcinoma 
* After Fingolimod Mylan treatment is stopped, symptoms of MS can return and may become 
worse than they were before or during treatment. 
* Autoimmune form of anaemia (decreased amount of red blood cells) where red blood cells are 
destroyed (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia). </p>
<p>If you experience any of these, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
