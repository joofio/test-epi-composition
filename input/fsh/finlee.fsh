<p>It is used in combination with another medicine (trametinib oral solution) in children aged 1 year and 
older to treat a type of brain tumour called glioma. </p>
<p>Finlee can be used in patients with: 
* low-grade glioma 
* high-grade glioma when the patient has received at least one radiation and/or chemotherapy 
treatment. </p>
<p>Finlee is used to treat patients whose brain tumour has a specific mutation (change) in the so-called 
BRAF gene. This mutation causes the body to make faulty proteins which in turn may cause the 
tumour to develop. The doctor will test for this mutation before starting treatment. </p>
<p>In combination with trametinib, Finlee targets these faulty proteins and slows down or stops the 
development of the tumour. Also read the leaflet for trametinib oral solution. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to the doctor before giving Finlee. The doctor needs to know if your child: 
* has eye problems including blockage of the vein draining the eye (retinal vein occlusion) or 
swelling in the eye which may be caused by fluid leakage (chorioretinopathy). 
* has heart problems such as heart failure or problems with the way their heart beats. 
* has or has had any kidney problems. 
* has or has had any liver problems. 
* has or has had any lung or breathing problems, including difficulty in breathing often 
accompanied by a dry cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. 
* has or has had any gastrointestinal problems such as diverticulitis (inflamed pouches in the 
colon) or metastases to the gastrointestinal tract. </p>
<p>Before your child starts taking Finlee, during and after their treatment, the doctor will make checks to 
avoid complications. </p>
<p>Skin examination 
Finlee may cause skin cancer. Usually, these skin changes remain local and can be removed with 
surgery and treatment with Finlee can be continued without interruption. The doctor may check your 
child s skin before and regularly during treatment. </p>
<p>Check your child s skin monthly during the treatment and for 6 months after they stop taking this 
medicine. Tell the doctor as soon as possible if you notice any changes to your child s skin such as a 
new wart, skin sore or reddish bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or colour of a 
mole. </p>
<p>Children younger than 1 year old 
The effects of Finlee in children younger than 1 year old are not known. Therefore, Finlee is not 
recommended in this age group. </p>
<p>Patients older than 18 years of age 
Information on treating patients older than 18 years of age with glioma is limited, therefore continued 
treatment into adulthood should be assessed by the doctor. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Finlee 
Before starting treatment, tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken 
or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Some medicines may affect how Finlee works or make it more likely that your child will have side 
effects. Finlee can also affect how some other medicines work. These include: 
* medicines used for birth control (contraceptives) containing hormones, such as pills, injections, 
or patches 
* medicines used to thin the blood, such as warfarin and acenocoumarol 
* medicines used to treat heart conditions, such as digoxin 
* medicines used to treat fungal infections, such as itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole 
* medicines used to treat Cushing s disease, such as ketoconazole 
* some medicines known as calcium channel blockers used to treat high blood pressure, such as 
diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine or verapamil 
* medicines used to treat cancer, such as cabazitaxel 
* some medicines used to lower fat (lipids) in the blood stream, such as gemfibrozil 
* some medicines used to treat certain psychiatric conditions, such as haloperidol 
* some medicines known as antibiotics, such as clarithromycin, doxycyline and telithromycin 
* some medicines used to treat tuberculosis (TB), such as rifampicin 
* some medicines used to lower cholesterol levels, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin 
* some medicines known as immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus and sirolimus 
* some medicines known as anti-inflammatory medicines, such as dexamethasone and 
methylprednisolone 
* some medicines used to treat HIV, such as ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, darunavir, 
delavirdine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, tipranavir, saquinavir and atazanavir 
* some medicines used to help with sleep, such as diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem 
* some medicines used for pain relief, such as fentanyl and methadone 
* medicines used to treat seizures (epilepsy), such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, 
valproic acid or carbamazepine 
* medicines known as antidepressants, such as nefazodone and the herbal medicine St John s wort 
(Hypericum perforatum) </p>
<p>Tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse if your child is taking any of these (or if you are not sure). The 
doctor may decide to adjust the dose. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
* If your child is pregnant, or if you think your child may be pregnant, ask the doctor or nurse for 
advice before taking this medicine. Finlee may potentially harm an unborn baby. 
* If your child becomes pregnant while taking this medicine, tell the doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether Finlee can pass into breast milk. If your child is breast-feeding, or planning to 
breast-feed, you must tell the doctor. You, your child and the doctor will decide if they will take Finlee 
or breast-feed. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Finlee may reduce sperm count and this may not return to normal levels after stopping treatment with 
Finlee. </p>
<p>Taking Finlee with trametinib oral solution: Trametinib may impair fertility in both males and 
females. </p>
<p>Prior to starting treatment with Finlee, talk to the doctor about options to improve your child s chances 
to have children in the future. </p>
<p>Contraception 
* If your child could become pregnant, they must use a reliable method of birth control 
(contraception) while they are taking Finlee in combination with trametinib oral solution and for 
at least 16 weeks following the last dose of Finlee in combination with trametinib. 
* Birth control containing hormones (such as pills, injections or patches) may not work as well 
while taking Finlee in combination with trametinib oral solution. An alternative effective 
method of birth control should be used to avoid the risk of pregnancy while taking this 
combination of medicines. Ask the doctor or nurse for advice. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Finlee can have side effects that may affect your child s ability to drive, ride a bike/scooter, use 
machines, or take part in other activities that need alertness. If your child has problems with vision or 
feels tired or weak, or their energy levels are low, they should avoid such activities. </p>
<p>Descriptions of these effects can be found in section 4. Read all the information in this leaflet for 
guidance. </p>
<p>Discuss with the doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are unsure about anything. Your child s disease, 
symptoms and treatment situation may also affect their ability to take part in such activities. </p>
<p>Finlee contains potassium 
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per maximum daily dose, i.e. essentially 
 potassium-free . </p>
<p>Finlee contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains &lt;0.00078 mg benzyl alcohol in each dispersible tablet. </p>
<p>Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. </p>
<p>Ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice if your child is pregnant or breast-feeding. This is because 
large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build up in your child s body and may cause side effects (called 
 metabolic acidosis ). </p>
<p>Ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice if your child has a liver or kidney disease. This is because 
large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build up in your child s body and may cause side effects (called 
 metabolic acidosis ). </p>
<ol>
<li>How to give Finlee </li>
</ol>
<p>Always give this medicine to your child exactly as the doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check 
with the doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How much to give 
The doctor will decide on the correct dose of Finlee based on your child s body weight. </p>
<p>The doctor may decide that your child should be given a lower dose if they get side effects. </p>
<p>How to give it 
Please read the Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet for details on how to prepare and give the 
dispersible tablets solution. </p>
<ul>
<li>Give Finlee twice a day. Giving Finlee at the same time each day will help you to remember 
when to give the medicine. Give each dose of Finlee about 12 hours apart. Trametinib oral 
solution is only taken once a day. Give trametinib oral solution with either the morning dose or 
the evening dose of Finlee. </li>
<li>Give Finlee on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal, this means 
that: * 
after taking Finlee, your child must wait at least 1 hour before eating. * 
after eating, your child must wait at least 2 hours before taking Finlee. * 
if necessary, breast-feeding and/or baby formula may be given on demand. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you give more Finlee than you should 
If you give too much Finlee, contact the doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice. If possible, show 
them the Finlee pack and this leaflet. </p>
<p>If you forget to give Finlee 
If the missed dose is less than 6 hours late, give it as soon as you remember. 
If the missed dose is 6 hours or more than 6 hours late, skip that dose. Give the next dose at the usual 
time and carry on giving Finlee at regular times as usual. 
Do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If your child vomits after taking Finlee 
If your child vomits after taking Finlee, do not give another dose until the next scheduled dose. </p>
<p>If you stop giving Finlee 
Give Finlee for as long as the doctor recommends. Do not stop unless the doctor advises you to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
