<p>Firazyr is used for treating the symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 2 years and older. </p>
<p>In HAE levels of a substance in your bloodstream called bradykinin are increased and this leads to 
symptoms like swelling, pain, nausea, and diarrhoea. </p>
<p>Firazyr blocks the activity of bradykinin and therefore ends the further progression of the symptoms.  </p>         </div>"""

<li>If you are allergic to icatibant, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Firazyr: 
- if you are suffering from angina (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle)<br />
- if you have recently suffered a stroke </p>
<p>Some of the side effects connected with Firazyr are similar to the symptoms of your disease. Tell your 
doctor immediately if you notice that your symptoms of the attack get worse after you received Firazyr </p>
<p>In addition: 
- You or your caregiver must be trained on subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique 
before you self-inject or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Immediately after you self-inject Firazyr or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr while you 
are experiencing a laryngeal attack (obstruction of the upper airway), you must seek medical 
care in a medical institution. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your symptoms are not resolved following one self- or caregiver administered injection of 
Firazyr, you should seek medical advice regarding additional injections of Firazyr. For adult 
patients, up to 2 additional injections may be given within 24 hours. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents  </p>
<p>Firazyr is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age or weighing less than 12 kg because 
it has not been studied in these patients.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Firazyr </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Firazyr is not known to interact with other medicines. If you are taking a medicine known as an 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for example: captopril, enalapril, ramipril, 
quinapril, lisinopril) which is used to lower your blood pressure or for any other reason, you should 
inform your doctor before receiving Firazyr. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor before starting to use Firazyr. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding you should not breast-feed for 12 hours after you have last received Firazyr. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Do not drive or use machines if you feel tired or dizzy as a result of your HAE attack or after using 
Firazyr. </p>
<p>Firazyr contains sodium </p>
<p>The injection solution contains less than 1 mmol (23 milligrams) of sodium per syringe, so it is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you have never received Firazyr previously, your first dose of Firazyr will always be injected by 
your doctor or nurse. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe for you to go home. After discussion 
with your doctor or nurse and after training in subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique, you 
may be able to inject yourself with Firazyr or your caregiver may inject Firazyr for you when you have 
an HAE attack. It is important that Firazyr is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you 
notice an attack of angioedema. Your healthcare provider will teach you and your caregiver how to 
safely inject Firazyr by following the instructions in the Package Leaflet.   </p>
<p>When and how often should you use Firazyr? </p>
<p>Your doctor has determined the exact dose of Firazyr and will tell you how often it should be used. </p>
<p>Adults </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection (3 ml, 30 mg) injected subcutaneously (under 
the skin) as soon as you notice the attack of angioedema (for example increased skin swelling, 
particularly affecting the face and neck, or increasing tummy pain). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you experience no relief of symptoms after 6 hours, you should seek medical advice regarding 
additional injections of Firazyr. For adults, up to 2 additional injections may be given within hours. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should not have more than 3 injections in a 24 hour period and if you require more than 
8 injections in a month, you should seek medical advice. </p>

increasing tummy pain).   </p>
</li>
