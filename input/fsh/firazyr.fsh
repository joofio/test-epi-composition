section 6).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Firazyr:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are suffering from angina (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle)  </li>
<li>if you have recently suffered a stroke </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the side effects connected with Firazyr are similar to the symptoms of your disease. Tell your 
doctor immediately if you notice that your symptoms of the attack get worse after you received Firazyr </p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You or your caregiver must be trained on subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique 
before you self-inject or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediately after you self-inject Firazyr or your caregiver injects you with Firazyr while you 
are experiencing a laryngeal attack (obstruction of the upper airway), you must seek medical 
care in a medical institution. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your symptoms are not resolved following one self- or caregiver administered injection of 
Firazyr, you should seek medical advice regarding additional injections of Firazyr. For adult 
patients, up to 2 additional injections may be given within 24 hours. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents  </p>
<p>Firazyr is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age or weighing less than 12 kg because 
it has not been studied in these patients.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Firazyr </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Firazyr is not known to interact with other medicines. If you are taking a medicine known as an 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for example: captopril, enalapril, ramipril, 
quinapril, lisinopril) which is used to lower your blood pressure or for any other reason, you should 
inform your doctor before receiving Firazyr. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor before starting to use Firazyr. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding you should not breast-feed for 12 hours after you have last received Firazyr. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Do not drive or use machines if you feel tired or dizzy as a result of your HAE attack or after using 
Firazyr. </p>
<p>Firazyr contains sodium </p>
<p>The injection solution contains less than 1 mmol (23 milligrams) of sodium per syringe, so it is 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

sure.  </p>
<p>If you have never received Firazyr previously, your first dose of Firazyr will always be injected by 
your doctor or nurse. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe for you to go home. After discussion 
with your doctor or nurse and after training in subcutaneous (under the skin) injection technique, you 
may be able to inject yourself with Firazyr or your caregiver may inject Firazyr for you when you have 
an HAE attack. It is important that Firazyr is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you 
notice an attack of angioedema. Your healthcare provider will teach you and your caregiver how to 
safely inject Firazyr by following the instructions in the Package Leaflet.   </p>
<p>When and how often should you use Firazyr? </p>
<p>Your doctor has determined the exact dose of Firazyr and will tell you how often it should be used. </p>
<p>Adults </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection (3 ml, 30 mg) injected subcutaneously (under 
the skin) as soon as you notice the attack of angioedema (for example increased skin swelling, 
particularly affecting the face and neck, or increasing tummy pain). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you experience no relief of symptoms after 6 hours, you should seek medical advice regarding 
additional injections of Firazyr. For adults, up to 2 additional injections may be given within hours. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should not have more than 3 injections in a 24 hour period and if you require more than 
8 injections in a month, you should seek medical advice. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection of 1 ml up to a maximum of 3 ml based on 
body weight injected subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you develop symptoms of an 
angioedema attack (for example increased skin swelling, particularly affecting the face and neck, 
increasing tummy pain).   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See section on instructions for use for the dose to inject. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are not sure which dose to inject, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your symptoms get worse or do not improve, you must seek immediate medical help. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How should Firazyr be administered? </p>
<p>Firazyr is intended for subcutaneous injection (under the skin). Each syringe should only be used once. </p>
<p>Firazyr is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue under the skin in the abdomen (tummy).  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>The following step-by step instructions are intended for:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-administration (adults)  </li>

<p>Step-by-Step Instructions for Injection </p>
<p>1) General Information </p>
<p>Clean the work area (surface) to be used before beginning the process. </p>
<p>Wash your hands with soap and water. </p>
<p>Open the tray by peeling back the seal. </p>
<p>Remove the pre-filled syringe from the tray. </p>
<p>Remove the cap from the end of the pre-filled syringe by unscrewing the cap. </p>
<p>Put down the pre-filled syringe after unscrewing the cap. 
2a) Preparing the syringe for<br />
children and adolescents (2-17 years) 
weighing 65 kg or less: </p>
<p>Important information for healthcare professionals and caregivers: </p>
<p>Where the dose is less than 30 mg (3 ml), the following equipment is required to extract the 
appropriate dose (see below): </p>
<p>a) Firazyr pre-filled syringe (containing icatibant solution) </p>
<p>b) Connector (adapter) </p>
<p>c) 3 ml graduated syringe </p>
<p>The required injection volume in ml should be drawn up in an empty 3 ml graduated syringe (see table 
below). </p>
<p>Table 1: Dosage regimen for children and adolescents </p>
<p>Body Weight 
Injection Volume 
12 kg to 25 kg 
1.0 ml 
26 kg to 40 kg 
1.5 ml 
41 kg to 50 kg 
2.0 ml 
51 kg to 65 kg 
2.5 ml </p>
<p>Patients weighing more than 65 kg will use the full contents of the pre-filled syringe (3 ml). </p>
<p>If you are not sure which volume of solution to extract, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse </p>
<p>1) Remove the caps on each end of the connector. </p>
<p>Avoid touching the ends of the connector and syringe tips, to prevent contamination </p>
<p>2) Screw the connector onto the pre-filled syringe. </p>
<p>3) Attach the graduated syringe to the other end of the connector ensuring that both connections fit 
securely. </p>
<p>Transferring the icatibant solution to the graduated syringe: </p>
<p>1) To start transfer of icatibant solution, push the pre-filled syringe plunger (on far left of below 
image). </p>
<p>2) If the icatibant solution does not begin to transfer to the graduated syringe, pull slightly on the 
graduated syringe plunger until the icatibant solution starts to flow into the graduated syringe (see 
below image). </p>
<p>3) Continue to push on the pre-filled syringe plunger until the required injection volume (dose) is 
transferred to the graduated syringe. Refer to table 1 for dosage information. </p>
<p>If there is air in the graduated syringe: </p>
<p>Turn the connected syringes so that the pre-filled syringe is on top (see below image). </p>
<p>Push the plunger of the graduated syringe so that any air is transferred back into the pre-filled 
syringe (this step may need to be repeated several times). </p>
<p>Withdraw the required volume of icatibant solution. 
4) Remove the pre-filled syringe and connector from the graduated syringe. </p>
<p>5) Discard the pre-filled syringe and connector into the sharps container. </p>
<p>2b) Preparing the syringe and needle for injection: 
All patients (adults, adolescents and children) </p>
<p>Remove the needle cap from the blister. </p>
<p>Twist the lid of the needle cap to break the seal (the needle should be still in the needle cap). </p>
<p>Grip the syringe firmly. Carefully attach the needle to the syringe containing the colourless 
solution. </p>
<p>Screw the syringe on the needle still fixed in the needle cap. </p>
<p>Remove the needle from the needle cap by pulling the syringe. Do not pull up on the plunger. </p>
<p>The syringe is now ready for injection. </p>
<p>3) Preparing the injection site </p>
<p>Choose the injection site. The injection site should be a skin fold on your abdomen approximately 
5-10 cm (2-4 inches) below your navel on either side. This area should be at least 5 cm (2 inches) 
away from any scars. Do not choose an area that is bruised, swollen, or painful.  </p>
<p>Clean the injection site with a rubbing alcohol pad and allow it to dry. </p>
<p>4) Injecting the solution </p>
<p>Hold the syringe in one hand between two fingers with your thumb at the bottom of the plunger. </p>
<p>Make sure that there is no air bubble in the syringe by pressing the plunger until the first drop 
appears on the tip of the needle. </p>
<p>Hold syringe between 45-90 degrees angle to skin with needle facing the skin. </p>
<p>Keeping the syringe in one hand, use your other hand to gently hold a fold of skin between your 
thumb and fingers at the previously disinfected injection site. </p>
<p>Hold the fold of skin, bring the syringe to the skin and quickly insert the needle into the skin 
fold. </p>
<p>Slowly push the plunger of the syringe with a steady hand until all the fluid is injected into the 
skin and no liquid remains in the syringe. </p>
<p>Press slowly so that this takes approximately 30 seconds. </p>
<p>Release the skin fold and gently pull the needle out. </p>
<p>5) Disposal of the injection material </p>
<p>Discard the syringe, needle and needle cap into the sharp container for throwing away waste that 
might hurt others if not handled properly. </p>         </div>"""
