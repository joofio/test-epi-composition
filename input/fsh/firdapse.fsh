  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>FIRDAPSE is used to treat symptoms of a disease of the nerves and the muscles called Lambert-Eaton 
myasthenic syndrome or LEMS in adults. This disease is a disorder affecting the transmission of nerve 
impulses to muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. It can be associated with certain tumour types 
(paraneoplastic form of LEMS) or in the absence of these tumours (non-paraneoplastic form of 
LEMS). </p>
<p>In patients suffering from this disease, a chemical substance called acetylcholine, which communicates 
nerve impulses to muscles is not released normally and the muscle doesn't receive some or all of the 
nerve's signals.  </p>
<p>FIRDAPSE works by increasing the release of acetylcholine and helps the muscle to receive the nerve 
signals. </p>         </div>"""
