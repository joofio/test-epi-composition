less than 18 years of age. Fluenz Tetra will help to protect against the four virus strains contained in 
the vaccine, and other strains closely related to them.
How Fluenz Tetra works
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can 
cause the flu.
Fluenz Tetra vaccine viruses are grown in chicken eggs. Each year the vaccine targets four strains of 
influenza, following the annual recommendations by the World Health Organisation.</p>         </div>"""

section 6  Contents of the pack and other information ). </p>
<p>if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to eggs or egg proteins. For signs of allergic 
reactions, see section 4  Possible side effects .</p>
<p>if you have a blood disorder or a cancer that affects the immune system.</p>
<p>if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result 
of a disease, medicine or other treatment.</p>
<p>if you are already taking acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used 
to relieve pain and lower fever). This is because of the risk of a very rare but serious disease
(Reye s syndrome).
If any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination:</p>
<p>if the child is less than 24 months of age. Children less than 24 months of age should not 
receive this vaccine because of the risk of side effects.</p>
<p>if you have severe asthma or are currently wheezing.</p>
<p>if you are in close contact with someone with a severely weakened immune system
(for example, a bone marrow transplant patient needing isolation).
If any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will 
decide if Fluenz Tetra is suitable for you.
Other medicines, other vaccines and Fluenz Tetra
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the person being vaccinated is taking, has recently taken or 
might take any other medicines, including medicines that do not require a prescription.</p>
<p>Do not give acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and 
lower fever) to children for 4 weeks after vaccination with Fluenz Tetra unless your doctor, 
nurse or pharmacist tells you otherwise. This is because of the risk of Reye s syndrome, a very 
rare but serious disease that can affect the brain and liver.</p>
<p>It is recommended that Fluenz Tetra is not given at the same time as influenza-specific 
antiviral medicines, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. This is because the vaccine may work 
less effectively.
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will decide if Fluenz Tetra can be given at the same time as other 
vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant soon or are 
breast-feeding, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before receiving this vaccine. Fluenz 
Tetra is not recommended for women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines</p>
<p>Fluenz Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p>         </div>"""

follow-up dose after an interval of at least 4 weeks. Follow your doctor, nurse or pharmacist s
