<ul>
<li>have experienced serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of Foclivia, </li>
<li>are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Foclivia, </li>
<li>are allergic to eggs, chicken protein, ovalbumin, </li>
<li>are allergic to kanamycin sulphate and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), formaldehyde,

<li>Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling

<li>However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as 
medical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you feel feverish, </li>
<li>if you have any illness or infection, </li>
<li>if you are having immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for 
cancer, or if you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency 
conditions). </li>
</ul>
<p>Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. </p>
<p>The doctor should inform you about the posibility to experience convulsion, in particular if you have 
had previous history of epilepsy. </p>
<p>Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell the doctor or nurse 
if you fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>Foclivia may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those with 
weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical 
problems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak 
immune system or an underlying long term medical problem. </p>
<p>In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, 
or may need to be delayed. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Foclivia 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. 
Foclivia can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. There is no 
information on administration of Foclivia with non-influenza vaccines. If administration of Foclivia 
with other vaccines cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such 
cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before taking this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and 
potential risks of giving you the vaccine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some side effects listed in Section 4.  Possible side effects  may affect your ability to drive or use 
tools or machines.  </p>
<p>Foclivia contains sodium and potassium 
Foclivia contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per 
dose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free. </p>         </div>"""
