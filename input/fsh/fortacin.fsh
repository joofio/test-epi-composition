medicines called local anaesthetics. </p>
<p>Fortacin is indicated for the treatment of premature ejaculation occurring in adult men (aged 18 years 
and over) from first sexual intercourse. This is when you always, or nearly always, have ejaculated 
within one minute of sexual intercourse and this causes you negative emotional effects. Fortacin works 
by decreasing the sensitivity of the head of the penis to increase time before ejaculation. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Fortacin 
* if you or your partner are allergic to lidocaine or prilocaine or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6); 
* if you or your partner have a history of allergy or sensitivity to other local anaesthetics with a 
similar structure (known as amide-type local anaesthetics). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Fortacin 
* if you, or your partner, have been diagnosed with a genetic disease or other condition affecting 
your red blood cells (glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, anaemia or methaemoglobinaemia); 
* if you have a history of medicine sensitivities, especially if you are not certain which medicine 
causes sensitivity; 
* if you suffer from severe liver problems. </p>
<p>Premature ejaculation may be due to a condition requiring medical supervision. If this product used as 
directed does not provide relief, consult a doctor. </p>
<p>Use with condoms 
* Fortacin must not be used with latex-free female and male condoms made of polyurethane as 
these condoms may deteriorate when used together with Fortacin and therefore may fail to 
protect from sexually transmitted disease or pregnancy. Fortacin can be used with contraceptive 
devices made of latex rubber, polyisoprene, nitrile and silicone as no deterioration has been 
shown. Carefully check the material that your contraceptive or your partner s contraceptive is 
made of before using this product. Ask your pharmacist if you are unsure. 
* If you use Fortacin with condoms, you may be more likely to be unable to develop or maintain 
an erection. You may also be more likely to have reduced feeling in and around the penis. </p>
<p>Avoid accidental contact 
* When you use this medicine, particularly during priming of the container, aim the container 
away from the face to avoid accidental contact with ears, eyes, nose and mouth. 
* If some medicine accidentally gets into your eyes or your partner s eyes, rinse them 
immediately with cold water or sodium chloride solution and keep them closed as much as 
possible until any effects, such as numbness, wear off. Be aware that normal protective 
mechanisms, such as blinking, or sensation of a foreign body in the eye, may not occur until the 
numbness has worn off. 
* Fortacin should not come into contact with a damaged ear drum. </p>
<p>Contact with other mucous membranes 
* Fortacin may also come into contact with other mucous membranes such as your, or your 
partner s, mouth, nose and throat, causing them to feel slightly numb for a short while. As this 
will reduce the ability to feel pain in these areas, extra care should be taken not to injure them 
until the numbness has worn off. </p>
<p>Possible transfer to partner, e.g. to vagina or the anus 
* During sexual intercourse, a small amount of this medicine may be transferred, e.g. to the 
vagina or the anus. Therefore, both you and your partner may feel slight numbness for a short 
while and should take care not to injure yourselves, particularly during sexual activity. For more 
information regarding possible side effects in sexual partners, see section 4. If you or your partner develop a rash or irritation, discontinue use of Fortacin. If symptoms persist, 
consult a doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fortacin 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. It is particularly important that you talk to a doctor before using Fortacin if you are taking 
any of the following medicines which may interact with Fortacin: 
* other local anaesthetics as benzocaine and procaine<br />
<em> heart medicines (anti-arrhythmic medicines as mexiletine and amiodarone) 
* fluvoxamine, cimetidine or beta-blockers, which may cause an increase in the blood levels of 
lidocaine. 
* medicines known to increase the risk of a disorder reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood 
(methaemoglobinaemia), such as those listed below: 
* Benzocaine   a local anaesthetic used to treat pain and itching 
* Chloroquine, pamaquine, primaquine, quinine - used to treat malaria<br />
</em> Metoclopramide   used to treat feelings of sickness (nausea) and vomiting, including in 
patients with migraine 
* Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, nitroglycerin), isosorbide mononitrate, erythrityl tetranitrate, 
pentaerythritol tetranitrate and other nitrate and nitrite medicines - used to treat angina 
(chest pain caused by the heart) 
* Sodium nitroprusside, isosorbide dinitrate   used to treat high blood pressure and heart 
failure 
* Nitrofurantoin   an antibiotic used to treat urinary and kidney infections 
* Sulphonamides (also called sulpha medicines), e.g. sulfamethoxazole   an antibiotic used 
to treat urinary infections, and sulfasalazine   used to treat Crohn s disease, ulcerative 
colitis and rheumatoid arthritis 
* Dapsone   used to treat skin conditions such as leprosy and dermatitis and also to prevent 
malaria and pneumonia in high-risk patients 
* Phenobarbital, phenytoin   used to treat epilepsy 
* Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS)   used to treat tuberculosis </p>
<p>The risk of methaemoglobinaemia can also be increased by the use of certain dyes (aniline dyes), or 
the pesticide naphthalene, so let your doctor know if you work with any dyes or chemical pesticides. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Fortacin is not approved for use by women.<br />
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Fortacin should not be used whilst your partner is pregnant unless you use an effective male condom, 
as listed above in section 2  Use with condoms , to prevent exposure of the unborn child. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
This medicine may be used while your partner is breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Fortacin may reduce the possibility of pregnancy. Therefore, patients hoping to achieve conception 
should either avoid using Fortacin, or, if this medicine is essential to achieve penetration, should wash 
the penis as thoroughly as possible five minutes after Fortacin has been applied, but prior to 
intercourse. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Fortacin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines when used at the 
recommended doses. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose of Fortacin is 3 sprays (3 sprays = 1 dose) on the head of the penis at least 
5 minutes before sexual intercourse. A maximum of 3 doses can be used within 24 hours with at least 
4 hours between doses. </p>
<p>The maximum recommended dose (3 doses within 24 hours) should not be exceeded. </p>
<p>Instructions for use 
* Before initial use, briefly shake the spray container and then prime the pump mechanism by 
spraying the valve three times into the air. Aim the container away from faces to avoid contact 
with eyes, nose, mouth and ears. 
* Before each subsequent dose, briefly shake the spray container and then re-prime the pump by 
spraying 1 time into the air. 
* Retract any foreskin from the head of the penis. Holding the can upright (valve up), apply 
1 dose (3 sprays) of Fortacin to the entire head of the penis, by covering one third with each 
spray.<br />
* Wait 5 minutes then wipe off any excess spray prior to having sexual intercourse. It is important 
that you wipe off any excess spray also if you use a condom (see also section 2 for other 
important information regarding use with condoms). </p>
<p>If you use more Fortacin than you should 
If you do apply too much, wipe it off. </p>
<p>Symptoms of using too much Fortacin are listed below. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you 
experience any of these. They are very unlikely to happen if it is used as instructed: 
* Feeling light-headed or dizzy 
* Tingling of the skin around the mouth and numbness of the tongue 
* Abnormal taste 
* Blurred vision 
* Ringing in the ears 
* There is also a risk of a disorder reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood 
(methaemoglobinaemia). This is more likely when certain medicines have been taken at the 
same time. If this happens, the skin becomes bluish-grey due to a lack of oxygen. </p>
<p>In serious cases of overdose, symptoms may include fits, low blood pressure, slowed breathing, 
stopped breathing and altered heart beat. These effects may be life-threatening. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
