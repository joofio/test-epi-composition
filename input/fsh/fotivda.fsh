blocking the action of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Blocking the action 
of VEGF prevents the formation of new blood vessels. </p>

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Fotivda:<br />
* if you have high blood pressure 
Fotivda can increase your blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure 
regularly and, if it is too high, may either give you a medicine to lower it, or reduce your dose of 
Fotivda. However, if your blood pressure remains too high, your doctor may decide to interrupt 
or to stop treatment with Fotivda. If you are already taking a medicine to treat high blood 
pressure, and your doctor reduces the dose of Fotivda or interrupts or stops treatment, you will 
be regularly checked for low blood pressure.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have had problems with blood clots<br />
Treatment with Fotivda may raise the risk of developing a blood clot (thrombus) in your blood 
vessels that could break loose and be carried by the blood stream to block another blood vessel.<br />
Tell your doctor if you have ever had one of the following:<br />
o 
a blood clot in your lungs (with cough, chest pain, sudden shortness of breath or coughing 
up blood) 
o 
blood clot in your legs or arms, eye, or brain (with pain or swelling in your hands or feet, 
reduced vision, or changes in your mental state) 
o 
a stroke, or signs and symptoms of a ‘mini-stroke’ (transient ischaemic attack) 
o 
a heart attack 
o 
high blood pressure 
o 
diabetes 
o 
major surgery 
o 
multiple injuries such as broken bones and damage to internal organs 
o 
inability to move for a long period 
o 
heart failure which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling 
o 
inability to breathe, bluish colour on your skin, fingertips or lips, restlessness, anxiety, 
confusion, altered consciousness or sense of awareness, rapid, shallow breathing, a racing 
heart or excessive sweating.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you suffer or have suffered from any of these symptoms or are treated for heart failure: 
o 
Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) when you exert yourself or when you lie down 
o 
Feeling weak and tired 
o 
Swelling (oedema) in your legs, ankles and feet 
o 
Reduced ability to exercise 
o 
Persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged phlegm 
Signs and symptoms of heart failure will be monitored whilst you are taking your medicine. If 
necessary, your doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or stop this treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or are treated for an abnormal rate and rhythm of the heartbeat (arrhythmia) 
Your doctor will monitor the effect of Fotivda on your heart by recording the electrical activity 
of your heart (an electrocardiogram) or by measuring your blood calcium, magnesium and 
potassium levels during your treatment.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have problems with your liver<br />
Your doctor will regularly monitor how well your liver is working before and during treatment 
with Fotivda (e.g. with blood tests), and if necessary may need to reduce how often you take 
Fotivda.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have problems with your thyroid gland or use medicines to treat thyroid disease 
Treatment with Fotivda may cause your thyroid gland to work less well than usual. Your doctor 
will regularly monitor how well your thyroid gland is working before and during treatment with 
Fotivda (e.g. with blood tests).  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse while taking Fotivda:<br />
* if you get shortness of breath or ankle swelling 
Tell your doctor right away as these may be symptoms of heart failure. Your doctor will 
monitor this, and depending on the severity may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or 
stop treatment with Fotivda. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you have had problems with bleeding 
Treatment with Fotivda may increase the risk of bleeding. If you get bleeding problems (with 
painful swollen stomach (abdomen), vomiting blood, coughing up blood, black stools, blood in 
your urine, headache or changes in your mental state), tell your doctor right away. Treatment 
with Fotivda may need to be temporarily stopped.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if laboratory tests show that there is protein in your urine<br />
Your doctor will monitor this at the beginning and during your treatment.  Depending on the 
results, your doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or stop this treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you suffer from a disease of the brain, called posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES) 
Tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms such as headache, seizure (fit), lack of 
energy, confusion, blindness or other visual and neurologic disturbances such as weakness in an 
arm or a leg. If PRES is diagnosed, your doctor will stop treatment with Fotivda.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the skin on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet become dry, cracked, 
scaling, or peeling, or is stinging or tingling 
These may be symptoms of a condition called hand foot skin reaction. Your doctor will treat the 
condition and, depending on the severity, the doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or 
interrupt or stop this treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation (developing a hole 
in the stomach or intestine or abnormal passages forming between parts of the intestine) such as 
severe stomach pain, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting or painful bowel obstruction, diarrhoea or 
rectal bleeding.<br />
Your doctor will regularly monitor you for these symptoms during your treatment with Fotivda. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you need to have an operation or another form of surgery 
Your doctor may recommend that you temporarily stop taking Fotivda if you have an operation 
or surgery, as it could affect wound healing.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Do not give Fotivda to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This medicine has not been 
studied in children and adolescents.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fotivda<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you have bought without a 
prescription.  </p>
<p>Fotivda may work less well when taken with some medicines.  Tell your doctor if you are taking any 
of the following medicines; they may decide to change your medication: 
* dexamethasone (a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and treat disorders of the immune 
system); 
* rosuvastatin (a medicine used to help lower cholesterol levels in your blood); 
* phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy); 
* nafcillin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentin (antibiotics); 
* St. John’s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for treatment of 
depression and anxiety) as this herbal remedy should not be used at the same time as Fotivda. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
* Do not take Fotivda if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor who will discuss with you the risks 
of taking Fotivda to you and your child. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both you and your partner must use effective contraception.  If you or your partner are taking 
hormonal contraceptives (the pill, an implant or patch) you must use an additional barrier 
method throughout treatment and for another month after completing treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Fotivda, as it is not known whether the active 
ingredient in Fotivda passes into breast-milk. Talk to your doctor if you are already breast-
feeding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor when planning a baby, as Fotivda may affect the fertility of men and 
women. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Fotivda can have side effects that may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving or 
using machines if you feel weak, tired, or dizzy. See also Section 4 “Possible side effects”. </p>
<p>Fotivda contains tartrazine (E102) 
The printing ink used on the Fotivda 890 microgram capsule contains tartrazine (E102), which may
