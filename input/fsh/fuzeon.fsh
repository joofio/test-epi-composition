<p>Fuzeon contains the active substance enfuvirtide and belongs to a group of medicines called 
 antiretrovirals .  </p>
<p>What Fuzeon is used for </p>
<p>Fuzeon is used for the treatment of Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) - in combination with 
other antiretroviral medicines in patients infected with HIV. 
* Your doctor has prescribed Fuzeon to help control your HIV infection. 
* Fuzeon is not a cure for HIV infection. </p>
<p>How Fuzeon works </p>
<p>HIV attacks cells in your blood called CD4 or T-cells. The virus needs to make contact with, and get 
inside these cells in order for the virus to multiply. Fuzeon helps by preventing this. </p>         </div>"""

<li>you are allergic to enfuvirtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fuzeon. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fuzeon if: 
* you have ever had any lung problems 
* you have ever had any kidney problems 
* you have chronic hepatitis B or C or another liver disease - you are more likely to get serious 
liver problems while using this medicine   </p>
<p>Signs of previous infections </p>
<p>In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections, signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to a recovery of the body s immune system. This 
improvement enables the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious 
symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Signs of autoimmune disorders  </p>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>Patients with liver disease </p>
<p>Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti-HIV therapy are at an increased risk for 
serious liver problems. Speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. </p>
<p>Bone disease (osteonecrosis) </p>
<p>Some patients taking combination anti-HIV medicines may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis. This is where the bone tissue dies because the blood supply has been lost (death of bone 
tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  </p>
<p>Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and 
shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these signs please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Risk factors for developing this disease include: how long you have been taking anti-HIV 
medicines, whether you take corticosteroids, how much alcohol you drink, how well your immune 
system works and being overweight.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fuzeon </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Fuzeon has 
been shown not to interact with your other anti-HIV medicines or rifampicin (an antibiotic). </p>
<p>Fuzeon with food and drink </p>
<p>You can use Fuzeon with or without food. However, you still need to follow the instructions given in 
the package leaflets for the other medicines you are taking. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. You should not use Fuzeon unless specifically told to by 
your doctor. </li>
<li>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk.  If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, 
you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Fuzeon has not been tested for its effect on your ability to drive a car or use tools or machines. If you 
feel dizzy while using Fuzeon do not drive or use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Fuzeon contains sodium </p>
<p>Fuzeon contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How to prepare and inject Fuzeon </p>
<p>Fuzeon must be given as an injection just below the skin   called a  subcutaneous  injection. Section 7 
tells you how to prepare Fuzeon and how to give yourself an injection. </p>
<p>How much to use </p>
<ul>
<li>The recommended dose is 90 mg twice a day for adults and adolescents (16 years and older).  </li>
<li>This is given as a 1 ml injection just below the skin. </li>
<li>It is best to use Fuzeon at the same time each day. </li>
<li>Try and space the doses evenly apart at times which are good for you   for example, first thing 
in the morning and then in the early evening. </li>
</ul>
<p>See further instructions on how to use Fuzeon at the end of this leaflet (see Section 7). There you will 
find instructions on how to prepare Fuzeon and how to give yourself an injection. </p>
<p>If you use more Fuzeon than you should </p>
<p>If you use more Fuzeon than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take the 
medicine pack with you.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Fuzeon </p>
<ul>
<li>If you forget to use a dose, use it as soon as you remember it. However if it is less than 6 hours 
before you are going to take your next regular dose, skip the missed dose. </li>
<li>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you stop using Fuzeon </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep using your medicine until your doctor tells you to stop. If you stop and there is a gap in 
your treatment this may speed up the chances of the HIV in your blood becoming resistant to 
Fuzeon. This is less likely if you use it regularly and without gaps in treatment. </li>
<li>The HIV virus in your blood may eventually become resistant to Fuzeon. If this happens, your 
blood levels of virus may begin to rise. This is when your doctor may decide to no longer keep 
treating you with Fuzeon. Your doctor should discuss this with you at that time. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Stop using Fuzeon and see a doctor straight away, if you notice any of the following serious side 
effects   you may need urgent medical treatment: </p>
<ul>
<li>Allergic reaction (hypersensitivity)   signs may include: rash, a high temperature or chills, 
feeling or being sick, sweating or shaking. 
This side effect is rare (affects less than 1 in 1,000 people). These signs do not definitely mean you are 
allergic to this medicine.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you get side effects where the injection is given </p>
<p>The most common side effects (affect more than 1 in 10 people), are problems at the place on your 
body where you have the injection. You will probably have one or more of the following mild to 
moderate reactions:  </p>
<p>redness </p>
<p>swelling </p>
<p>feeling itchy  </p>
<p>bruises </p>
<p>hardened skin or bumps </p>
<p>pain, feeling sore or tender 
These reactions can appear in the first week of treatment and usually only last for up to 7 days. They 
generally do not get worse after this time. If you have any of these reactions do not stop using Fuzeon, 
but talk to your doctor about any concerns you have. </p>
<p>Reactions may be worse when injections are repeated in the same place on the body. They may also be 
worse when the injection is given deeper than intended (for example, into a muscle). Rarely, you may 
get an infection at a place where an individual injection was given. To reduce the risk of infection, it is 
important that you follow the instructions provided in Section </p>         </div>"""
