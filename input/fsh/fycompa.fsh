<p>Fycompa is used in association with other antiepileptic drugs to treat certain forms of epilepsy:<br />
In adults, adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 4 to 11 years) 
- It is used to treat fits that affect one part of your brain (called a  partial seizure ). 
- These partial seizures may or may not then be followed by a fit affecting all of your brain 
(called a  secondary generalisation ). 
In adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older), and children (from 7 to 11 years) 
- It is also used to treat certain fits that affect all of your brain from the start (called  generalised 
seizures ) and cause convulsions or staring spells. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores 
after taking perampanel. </li>
<li>If you are allergic to perampanel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fycompa if you have liver problems or moderate or 
severe kidney problems. 
You should not take Fycompa if you have serious liver problems or moderate or serious kidney 
problems. 
Before taking this medicine you should tell your doctor if you have a history of alcoholism or drug 
dependence. 
Cases of increased liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking Fycompa in combination 
with other antiepileptic drugs. </p>
<ul>
<li>Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. </li>
<li>Fycompa may make you more likely to fall over, particularly if you are an older person; this 
might be due to your illness. </li>
<li>Fycompa may make you aggressive, angry or violent. It may also cause you to have unusual or 
extreme changes in behaviour or mood, abnormal thinking and/or loss of touch with reality. 
If you or your family and/or friends notice any of these reactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </li>
</ul>
<p>A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing 
themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, contact your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Serious skin reactions including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and 
Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been reported with the use of perampanel. 
- DRESS typically, although not exclusively, appears as flu-like symptoms and a rash with a high 
body temperature, increased levels of liver enzymes seen in blood tests and an increase in a type 
of white blood cell (eosinophilia) and enlarged lymph nodes. 
- Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS) can appear initially as reddish target- like spots or circular 
patches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and 
eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever 
and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-
threatening complications or be fatal. 
If you experience any of the above after taking Fycompa (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. </p>
<p>Children 
Fycompa is not recommended for children aged under 4. The safety and effectiveness are not yet 
known in children under 4 years of age for partial seizures and under 7 years of age in generalised 
seizures. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Fycompa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Taking 
Fycompa with certain other medicines may cause side effects or affect how they work. Do not start or 
stop other medicines without talking to your doctor or pharmacist. 
- Other anti-epileptic medicines, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin that are 
used to treat fits may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken 
these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
- Felbamate (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) may also affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you 
are taking or have recently taken this medicine as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
- Midazolam (a medicine used to stop prolonged, acute (sudden) convulsive seizures, for sedation 
and sleep problem) may be affected by Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking midazolam 
as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
- Some other medicines such as rifampicin (a medicine used to treat bacterial infections), 
hypericum (St. John s Wort) (a medicine used to treat mild anxiety) and ketoconazole (a 
medicine used to treat fungal infections) may affect Fycompa. Tell your doctor if you are taking 
or have recently taken these medicines as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
- Hormonal contraceptives (including oral contraceptives, implants, injections, and patches) 
Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make certain hormonal 
contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other forms of safe and effective 
contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You should continue doing this for 
one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may be appropriate contraception 
for you. </p>
<p>Fycompa with alcohol 
Speak to your doctor before drinking alcohol. Be careful about consuming alcohol with epilepsy 
medicines including Fycompa. 
- Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can make you less alert and affect your ability to drive 
or use tools or machines. 
- Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa can also make any feelings of anger, confusion or 
sadness worse. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Do not stop treatment without first discussing it 
with your doctor. 
- Fycompa is not recommended in pregnancy. 
- You must use a reliable method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are 
being treated with Fycompa. You should continue doing this for one month after stopping 
treatment. Tell your doctor if you are taking hormonal contraceptives. Fycompa may make 
certain hormonal contraceptives such as levonorgestrel less effective. You should use other 
forms of safe and effective contraception (such as a condom or coil) when taking Fycompa. You 
should also do this for one month after stopping treatment. Discuss with your doctor what may 
be appropriate contraception for you. 
It is not known whether the ingredients of Fycompa can pass into breast milk. 
The doctor will weigh up the benefit and risks to your baby of taking Fycompa while you are 
breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines until you know how Fycompa affects you. 
You must talk to your doctor about the effect of your epilepsy on driving and using machines. 
- Fycompa may make you feel dizzy or sleepy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. If this 
happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. 
- Drinking alcohol while taking Fycompa may make these effects worse. </p>
<p>Fycompa contains lactose 
Fycompa contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
