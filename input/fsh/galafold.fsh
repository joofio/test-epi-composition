<p>This medicine is used for the long-term treatment of Fabry disease in adults and adolescents aged 
12 years and older who have certain genetic mutations (changes).  </p>
<p>Fabry disease is caused by the lack of or a faulty enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A ( -Gal A). 
Depending upon the kind of mutation (change) in the gene that produces  -Gal A, the enzyme does 
not work properly or is completely absent. This enzyme defect leads to abnormal deposits of a fatty 
substance known as globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in kidneys, heart, and other organs, leading to the 
symptoms of Fabry disease.  </p>
<p>This medicine works by stabilising the enzyme that your body produces naturally, so that it can work 
better to reduce the amount of GL-3 that has accumulated in your cells and tissues. </p>         </div>"""

discontinue your treatment with Galafold. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Galafold if you have severely reduced kidney function as Galafold is

medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including supplements and herbal 
medicines. </p>
