  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>The active substance of Galvus, vildagliptin, belongs to a group of medicines called “oral 
antidiabetics”. </p>
<p>Galvus is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It is used when diabetes cannot be 
controlled by diet and exercise alone. It helps to control the level of sugar in the blood. Your doctor 
will prescribe Galvus either alone or together with certain other antidiabetic medicines which you will 
already be taking, if these have not proved sufficiently effective to control diabetes. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body 
makes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. </p>
<p>Insulin is a substance which helps to lower the level of sugar in the blood, especially after meals. 
Glucagon is a substance which triggers the production of sugar by the liver, causing the blood sugar 
level to rise. The pancreas makes both of these substances. </p>
<p>How Galvus works 
Galvus works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. This helps to control 
the blood sugar level. This medicine has been shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent 
complications from your diabetes. Even though you are now starting a medicine for your diabetes, it is 
important that you continue to follow the diet and/or exercise which has been recommended for you. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to vildagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic to vildagliptin or any of the other ingredients of 
Galvus, do not take this medicine and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Galvus 
* if you have type 1 diabetes (i.e. your body does not produce insulin) or if you have a condition 
called diabetic ketoacidosis. 
* if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea (your doctor may want to 
reduce your dose of the sulphonylurea when you take it together with Galvus in order to avoid 
low blood glucose [hypoglycaemia]). 
* if you have moderate or severe kidney disease (you will need to take a lower dose of Galvus). 
* if you are on dialysis. 
* if you have liver disease. 
* if you suffer from heart failure. 
* if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. </p>
<p>If you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should 
not take this medicine. </p>
<p>Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also 
advised to pay particular attention to new onset of blisters or ulcers while taking Galvus. Should these 
occur, you should promptly consult your doctor. </p>
<p>A test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of Galvus treatment, at three-
month intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. This is so that signs of increased liver 
enzymes can be detected as early as possible. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of Galvus in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Galvus 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor may wish to alter your dose of Galvus if you are taking other medicines such as: 
- thiazides or other diuretics (also called water tablets) 
- corticosteroids (generally used to treat inflammation) 
- thyroid medicines 
- certain medicines affecting the nervous system. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not use Galvus during pregnancy. It is not known if Galvus passes into breast milk. You 
should not use Galvus if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you feel dizzy while taking Galvus, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Galvus contains lactose 
Galvus contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Galvus contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. </p>         </div>"""

If you take too many Galvus tablets, or if someone else has taken your medicine, talk to your doctor 
straight away. Medical attention may be needed. If you need to see a doctor or go to the hospital, take 
the pack with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Galvus 
If you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next 
dose at the usual time. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
