called “antigonadotropin-releasing hormones” which act against the actions of the natural 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH regulates the release of gonadotropins (luteinising 
hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)). Gonadotropins play an important role in 
human fertility and reproduction. In women, FSH is needed for the growth and development of 
follicles in the ovaries. Follicles are small round sacs that contain the egg cells. LH is needed to 
release the mature egg cells from the follicles and ovaries (i.e. ovulation). Ganirelix Gedeon Richter 
inhibits the action of GnRH, resulting in suppression of the release of especially LH. </p>
<p>Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is used for 
In women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other 
methods, occasionally ovulation may occur too early causing a significant reduction in the chance of 
getting pregnant. Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is used to prevent the premature LH surge that might cause 
such a premature release of egg cells. 
In clinical studies ganirelix was used with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or 
corifollitropin alfa, a follicle stimulant with a long duration of action. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to ganirelix or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6); 
- if you are hypersensitive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or a GnRH analogue; 
- if you have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease; 
- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ganirelix Gedeon Richter. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
If you have an active allergic condition, please tell your doctor. Your doctor will decide, depending on 
the severity, if additional monitoring is required during treatment. Cases of allergic reactions have 
been reported, as early as with the first dose. 
Allergic reactions, both generalised and local, including hives (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips, 
tongue, and/or throat that may cause difficulty in breathing and/or swallowing (angioedema and/or 
anaphylaxis) have been reported (see also section 4). If you have an allergic reaction, stop using 
Ganirelix Gedeon Richter and seek immediate medical assistance. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
During or following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may 
develop. This syndrome is related to the stimulation procedure with gonadotropins. Please refer to the 
package leaflet of the gonadotropin-containing medicine prescribed for you. </p>
<p>Multiple births or birth defects 
The incidence of congenital malformations after assisted reproduction techniques may be slightly 
higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to 
characteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment (e.g. age of the woman, sperm 
characteristics) and to the higher incidence of multiple gestations after assisted reproduction 
techniques. The incidence of congenital malformations after assisted reproduction techniques using 
ganirelix is not different from that after using other GnRH analogues in the course of assisted 
reproduction techniques. </p>
<p>Pregnancy complications 
There is a slightly increased risk of pregnancy outside of the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy) in women 
with damaged fallopian tubes. </p>
<p>Women weighing less than 50 kg or more than 90 kg 
The efficacy and safety of ganirelix has not been established in women weighing less than 50 kg or 
more than 90 kg. Ask your doctor for further information. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is no relevant use of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter in children or adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ganirelix Gedeon Richter 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Ganirelix Gedeon Richter should be used during controlled ovarian stimulation for assisted 
reproduction techniques (ART). 
Do not use Ganirelix Gedeon Richter during pregnancy and breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
The effects of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied. </p>
<p>Ganirelix Gedeon Richter contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is used as part of the treatment for assisted reproduction techniques (ART) 
including in vitro fertilisation (IVF). </p>
<p>Ovarian stimulation with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or corifollitropin may start at day 2 or 3 
of your period. Ganirelix Gedeon Richter (0.25 mg) should be injected into the fatty layer just under 
the skin once daily, starting on day 5 or day 6 of stimulation. Based on your ovarian response, your 
doctor may decide to start on another day. </p>
<p>Ganirelix Gedeon Richter and FSH should be administered approximately at the same time. However, 
these medicines should not be mixed and different injection sites are to be used. </p>
<p>Daily treatment with Ganirelix Gedeon Richter should be continued up to the day that sufficient 
follicles of adequate size are present. Final maturation of the egg cells in the follicles can be induced 
by administering human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). 
The time between two injections of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter as well as the time between the last 
injection of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter and hCG injection should not exceed 30 hours, as otherwise a 
premature ovulation (i.e. release of egg cells) may occur. 
Therefore, when injecting Ganirelix Gedeon Richter in the morning treatment with Ganirelix Gedeon 
Richter should be continued throughout the gonadotropin treatment period including the day of 
triggering ovulation.<br />
When injecting Ganirelix Gedeon Richter in the afternoon the last injection of Ganirelix Gedeon 
Richter should be given in the afternoon prior to the day of triggering ovulation. </p>
<p>Instructions for use 
Before the administration of this medicine it is very important that you also carefully read and closely 
follow the detailed instructions for use provided at the end of this package leaflet. </p>
<p>Injection site 
Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is supplied in pre-filled syringes and should be injected slowly, into the fatty 
layer just under the skin, preferably in the upper leg. Inspect the solution before use. Do not use if the 
solution contains particles or is not clear. You may notice air bubble(s) in the pre-filled syringe. This 
is expected, and removal of the air bubble(s) is not needed. If you administer the injections yourself or 
have it done by your partner, follow the instructions below and at the end of the Package leaflet 
carefully. Do not mix Ganirelix Gedeon Richter with any other medicines. </p>
<p>Preparing the injection site 
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Swab the injection site with a disinfectant (for 
example alcohol) to remove any surface bacteria. Clean about 5 cm (two inches) around the point 
where the needle will go in and let the disinfectant dry for at least one minute before proceeding. </p>
<p>Inserting the needle 
Remove needle shield. Pinch a fold of skin between index finger and thumb. Insert the needle at the 
base of the pinched-up skin at an angle of 45° to the skin surface. Vary the injection site with each 
injection. </p>
<p>Checking the correct needle position 
Gently draw back the plunger to check if the needle is positioned correctly. Any blood drawn into the 
syringe means the needle tip has penetrated a blood vessel. If this happens, do not inject Ganirelix 
Gedeon Richter, but remove the syringe, cover the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant 
and apply pressure; bleeding should stop in a minute or two. Do not use this syringe and dispose of it 
properly. Start again with a new syringe.  </p>
<p>Injecting the solution 
Once the needle has been correctly placed, push the plunger down slowly and steadily, so the solution 
is correctly injected and the skin tissues are not damaged. Push the plunger down until the syringe is 
empty and wait for 5 seconds. </p>
<p>Removing the syringe 
Pull the syringe out quickly and apply pressure to the site with a swab containing disinfectant. Use the 
pre-filled syringe only once. </p>
<p>If you use more Ganirelix Gedeon Richter than you should 
Contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Ganirelix Gedeon Richter 
If you realise that you forgot a dose, administer it as soon as possible. 
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you are more than 6 hours late (so the time between two injections is longer than 30 hours) 
administer the dose as soon as possible and contact your doctor for further advice. </p>
<p>If you stop using Ganirelix Gedeon Richter 
Do not stop using Ganirelix Gedeon Richter unless advised to by your doctor, as this may affect the 
outcome of your treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
