protect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, and 58. These diseases include pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and
vagina), pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the anus and genital warts in males and females.
Gardasil 9 has been studied in males 9 to 26 years of age and females 9 to 45 years of age.
Gardasil 9 protects against the HPV types that cause most cases of these diseases.
Gardasil 9 is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases.
Gardasil 9 does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease
associated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected
with one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Gardasil 9 can still protect against diseases associated
with the other HPV types in the vaccine.
Gardasil 9 cannot cause HPV-related diseases.
When an individual is vaccinated with Gardasil 9, the immune system (the body s natural defence
system) stimulates production of antibodies against the nine vaccine HPV types, to help protect
against the diseases caused by these viruses.
If you or your child receive a first dose of Gardasil 9, you have to complete the full vaccination course
with Gardasil 9. If you or your child already received an HPV vaccine, ask your doctor if Gardasil 9 is right for you.
Gardasil 9 should be used in accordance with official guidelines.</p>         </div>"""

* developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil or Silgard (HPV types 6, 11,
16, and 18) or Gardasil 9. Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child:
* has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example
haemophilia;
* has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or
medicines that affect the immune system;
* suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for
example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
Fainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle
injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if fainting occurred with a previous injection.
As with any vaccine, Gardasil 9 may not fully protect all of those who get the vaccine.
Gardasil 9 will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore appropriate
precautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. If you are a woman, you should
continue to follow your doctor s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and
protective measures.
What other important information should you or your child know about Gardasil 9
The duration of protection is not yet known. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine
whether a booster dose is needed.
Other medicines and Gardasil 9
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any
other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Gardasil 9 can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) and tetanus (T)
with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] (IPV) (dTap,
dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of your body, for example the
other arm or leg) during the same visit.
Gardasil 9 may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system.
Hormonal contraceptives (for example the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Gardasil 9. Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or
pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine. Information from pregnant women vaccinated
with Gardasil 9 does not show a higher risk for miscarriages or babies with birth defects.
However, if you are pregnant or if you become pregnant during the course of vaccination, it is
recommended to postpone or interrupt vaccination until you are no longer pregnant.
Gardasil 9 may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines
Gardasil 9 may slightly and temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4. Possible side effects ).
Gardasil 9 contains sodium chloride
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil 9 complete the vaccination
course with Gardasil 9. Gardasil 9 will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the
upper arm or thigh).
If you forget one dose of Gardasil 9
If a scheduled injection is missed, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important that you follow your doctor or nurse s instructions regarding return visits for the follow-
up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor
for advice. When Gardasil 9 is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course
should be done with Gardasil 9, and not another HPV vaccine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</li>
