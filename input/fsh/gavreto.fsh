<p>Gavreto is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance pralsetinib. </p>
<p>What Gavreto is used for </p>
<p>Gavreto is used to treat adults with advanced stages of a form of lung cancer called  non-small cell 
lung cancer  ( NSCLC ), that presents with a specific rearrangement in a gene called rearranged 
during transfection (RET) if you have not been previously treated with another RET inhibitor 
medicine.  </p>
<p>How Gavreto works </p>
<p>In patients whose cancer is due to an altered RET gene, the change in the gene causes the body to 
make an abnormal protein called a RET fusion protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and 
cancer. Gavreto blocks the action of RET fusion proteins and may help to slow or stop your lung 
cancer from growing. It may also help to shrink your cancer. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Gavreto works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
please ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Gavreto. 
* if you have a history of lung or breathing problems other than lung cancer. 
* if you have had high blood pressure<br />
<em> if you have had liver problems<br />
</em> if you have had bleeding problems 
* if you have ever had tuberculosis or if you have been in close contact with someone who has or 
has had tuberculosis. Your doctor may perform tests to see if you have tuberculosis </p>
<p>Gavreto can cause side effects that you need to tell your doctor about straight away. These include: 
* lung inflammation (pneumonitis). Gavreto may cause severe, life-threatening or fatal swelling 
(inflammation) of the lungs during treatment. The signs may be similar to those from your lung 
cancer. Tell your doctor straight away if you have any new or worsening signs including 
difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, or cough with or without mucous, or fever.<br />
* high blood pressure (hypertension). Gavreto can increase the occurrence of high blood 
pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure before you start treatment, then after 
1 week of your treatment and then as needed. If you have high blood pressure which is not well 
controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your doctor as it is important to make 
sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting Gavreto treatment. 
* liver injury (transaminase elevations). Your doctor will take blood tests before you start 
treatment, then every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of your treatment and then as needed. This 
is to check you do not have any liver problems while taking Gavreto. Tell your doctor straight 
away if you get any of the following signs: yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, 
pain on the right side of your stomach area, dark urine, itchy skin, feeling less hungry than 
usual, nausea or vomiting, feeling tired, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. 
* bleeding problems. Serious bleeding can occur during treatment with Gavreto. Tell your doctor 
straight away if you have any of these symptoms: are vomiting blood or vomit that looks like 
coffee-grounds, coughing up blood or blood clots, have pink or brown urine, red or black (looks 
like tar) stools, unusual bleeding or bruising of your skin, menstrual bleeding that is heavier 
than normal, unusual vaginal bleeding, nose bleeds that happen often, drowsiness or difficulty 
being awakened. 
* abnormal ECG. Gavreto may result in abnormal ECGs. You will have an ECG taken before 
and during your treatment with Gavreto. Tell your Doctor if you feel light-headed or experience 
palpitations as it may be a symptom of abnormal ECG. </p>
<p>Look out for this while you are taking Gavreto. See  Side effects  in section 4 for more information. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Gavreto has not been studied in children or adolescents. Do not give this medicine to children or 
adolescents under the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Gavreto </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Gavreto may affect the way other medicines work, and certain other medicines may affect 
how Gavreto works. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Gavreto if you are taking any of the following 
medicines: </p>
<p>The following medicines can increase the concentration of Gavreto in the blood: 
* medicines used to treat AIDS/HIV (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir) 
* medicines used to treat infections. These include medicines that treat fungal infections 
(antifungals such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) and medicines that 
treat certain types of bacterial infection (antibiotics such as telithromycin) 
* nefazodone, a medicine used to treat depression </p>
<p>The following medicines can reduce the effectiveness of Gavreto: 
* medicines used to stop seizures or fits (anti-epileptics such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or 
phenobarbital) 
* medicines used to treat tuberculosis (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin) 
* St. John s Wort, a herbal medicine used to treat depression </p>
<p>Gavreto may affect the way some other medicines work, including: 
* cyclosporine 
* paclitaxel 
* warfarin </p>
<p>The medicines listed here may not be the only ones that could interact with Gavreto. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Gavreto with food and drink </p>
<p>You should avoid drinking grapefruit juice and eating grapefruit or Seville oranges while on treatment 
with Gavreto. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Contraception in females:  </p>
<p>You should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this medicine. If you are able to have children, you 
must use highly effective contraception (for example, double-barrier contraception such as condom 
and diaphragm) while on treatment and for at least 2 weeks after stopping treatment. Gavreto may 
reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive methods (for example, birth control pill); therefore, 
hormonal contraceptives may not be considered highly effective. If hormonal contraception is 
unavoidable, it must be used in combination with a condom.  </p>
<p>Contraception in males:  </p>
<p>Males with female partners of childbearing potential must use effective contraception, including a 
barrier method, during treatment and for 1 week after completion of treatment.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner. </p>
<p>Pregnancy: </p>
<p>This medicine is not recommended for use during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary. Avoid 
becoming pregnant while being treated with this medicine as it may harm your unborn baby. Your 
doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Gavreto during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Your doctor may check if you are pregnant before you start treatment with this medicine. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed. It is not known if Gavreto passes 
into your breast milk. You should not breast-feed during treatment with this medicine and for at least 1 
week after the last dose. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby during this time.  </p>
<p>Fertility: </p>
<p>It is possible that this medicine could permanently affect your ability to have children. You are 
encouraged to talk to a doctor about saving your sperm or eggs before using Gavreto. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Gavreto may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Gavreto may cause you to feel fatigued. If 
this happens, you should not drive or operate heavy machinery until your symptoms resolve. Talk to 
your doctor about whether it is okay for you to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Gavreto contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
