pain, ulcers, blisters, and shedding of the skin. The lips, nose, eyes and genitals may also be 
affected.

(feeling sick) or loss of appetite. 
* Eye problems (uncommon), such as pain, redness, watery eyes, light sensitivity, changes in 
vision or ingrowing eyelashes. This may mean that you have an ulcer on the surface of the eye 
(cornea). </p>

<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)

stomach area and severe nausea and vomiting.

without possible jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). This side effect is uncommon; 
however, some patients have died from this.

swelling or reddening (known as palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome or hand and foot 
syndrome). </p>
