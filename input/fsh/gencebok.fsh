These short periods when premature babies stop breathing are due to the baby’s breathing centres not

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your baby’s doctor before your newborn is given Gencebok. 
Prior to starting treatment for apnoea of prematurity with Gencebok other causes of apnoea should 
have been excluded or properly treated by your baby’s doctor. </p>
<p>Gencebok should be used with caution. Please inform your baby’s doctor: </p>
<ul>
<li>If your newborn suffers from seizures </li>
<li>If your newborn suffers from any heart disease </li>
<li>If your newborn has kidney or liver problems </li>
<li>If your newborn has frequent regurgitation </li>
<li>If your newborn produces more urine than usual </li>
<li>If your newborn has a reduced weight gain or food intake </li>
<li>If you (the mother) consumed caffeine prior to delivery </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Gencebok 
Tell your baby’s doctor if your newborn is taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Please inform your baby’s doctor if your newborn has been previously treated with theophylline.  Do 
not use the following medicines during the treatment with Gencebok without talking to your baby’s 
doctor. The doctor may need to adjust the dose or change one of the medicines to something else: 
- theophylline (used to treat breathing difficulties) 
- doxapram (used to treat breathing difficulties) 
- cimetidine (used to treat gastric disease) 
- ketoconazole (used to treat fungine infections) 
- phenobarbital (used to treat epilepsy) 
- phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy) </p>
<p>This medicine may increase the risk for serious intestinal disease with bloody stools (necrotising 
enterocolitis) when administered with medicines used to treat gastric disease (such as antihistamine 
H2 receptor blockers or proton-pump inhibitors that reduces gastric acid secretion). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you (the mother) are breast-feeding while your infant is treated with Gencebok, you should not 
drink coffee or take any other high caffeine product as caffeine passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Gencebok contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. is essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Gencebok should only be used in a neonatal intensive care unit in which adequate facilities are 
available for patient surveillance and monitoring. Treatment should be initiated under 
supervision of a physician experienced in neonatal intensive care. </p>
<p>Dose 
Your baby’s doctor will prescribe the right amount of Gencebok based on your baby’s weight. The 
starting dose is 20 mg per kg body weight (equivalent to 2 ml per kg body weight). 
The maintenance dose is 5 mg per kg body weight (equivalent to 0.5 ml per kg body weight) every 
24 hours. </p>
<p>Route and method of administration 
Gencebok will be infused by controlled intravenous infusion, using a syringe infusion pump or other 
metered infusion device. This method is also known as “a drip”. 
Some of the doses (maintenance doses) may be given by mouth. 
It may be needed that your baby’s doctor decides to check the levels of caffeine in a blood test 
periodically throughout treatment to avoid toxicity. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
Your baby’s doctor will decide exactly how long your newborn must continue therapy with Gencebok. 
If your baby has 5 to 7 days without apnoea attacks, the doctor will stop the treatment. </p>
<p>If your newborn receives more Gencebok than he/she should 
Your newborn may experience fever, rapid breathing (tachypnoea), jitteriness, muscular tremor 
vomiting, high blood levels of sugar (hyperglycemia), low blood levels of potassium (hypokalaemia), 
high blood levels of certain chemicals (urea), elevated number of certain cells (leukocyte) in blood and 
seizures if he/she receives more caffeine citrate than he/she should. 
In the event of this happening treatment with Gencebok should be stopped immediately and your 
baby’s doctor should treat the overdose. </p>
