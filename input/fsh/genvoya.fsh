<li>Use effective contraception while taking Genvoya. </li>
<li>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Genvoya.  This is because some of the active 
substances in this medicine pass into human breast milk.  Breast-feeding is not recommended in 
women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.  If 
you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your 
doctor as soon as possible.  </li>

if you are not sure. </p>
<p>There are two strengths of Genvoya tablets. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate tablet for your 
age and weight. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is: </p>
<p>Adults, adolescents and children who weigh at least 25 kg: one tablet each day with food (one 
150 mg/150 mg/200 mg/10 mg tablet) </p>
<p>Children 2 years of age and older, who weigh at least 14 kg but less than 25 kg: one tablet each 
day with food (one 90 mg/90 mg/120 mg/6 mg tablet) </p>
<p>Due to the bitter taste, it is recommended not to chew or crush the tablet. </p>
<p>If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, you can split it in half.  Take both halves of the 
tablet one after the other to get the full dose.  Do not store the split tablet. 
The score line on the 90 mg/90 mg/120 mg/6 mg tablet is only there to help you break the tablet if 
your child has difficulty swallowing it whole. </p>
<p>Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine is 
fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not change the 
dose unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>Do not take antacids or multivitamins at the same time as Genvoya.  If you are taking medicines, 
oral supplements, antacids or laxatives containing minerals (such as magnesium, aluminium, 
calcium, iron, zinc), take them at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after Genvoya. </p>
<p>If you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Genvoya following completion of dialysis. </p>
<p>If you take more Genvoya than you should </p>
<p>If you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Genvoya you may be at increased risk of 
experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). </p>
<p>Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle 
with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Genvoya </p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of Genvoya. </p>
<p>If you do miss a dose: 
* If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Genvoya, you must take the tablet as 
soon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. 
* If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Genvoya, then do not take the 
missed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. </p>
<p>If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Genvoya, take another tablet with food. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Genvoya </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Genvoya without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Genvoya can seriously 
affect your response to future treatment.  If Genvoya is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor 
before you restart taking Genvoya tablets. </p>
<p>When your supply of Genvoya starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. </p>
<p>If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Genvoya 
treatment without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after 
stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not 
recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Possible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak 
immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon 
after anti-HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement 
in the body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been 
present with no obvious symptoms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>muscle weakness </p>
</li>
<li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body </li>
<li>palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice the side effects described above, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Very common side effects 
(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
* feeling sick (nausea) </p>
<p>Common side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* abnormal dreams 
* headache 
* dizziness 
* diarrhoea 
* vomiting 
* stomach pain 
* wind (flatulence) 
* rash 
* tiredness (fatigue) </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* low red blood cell count (anaemia) 
* suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt (in patients who have had depression or mental health 
problems before), depression 
* problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) 
* swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) 
* itching (pruritus) 
* hives (urticaria) </p>
<p>If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Other effects that may be seen during HIV treatment </p>
<p>The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available data). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Genvoya 
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, 
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of 
the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>joint stiffness </p>
</li>
<li>joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) </li>
<li>difficulty with movement 
  If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
