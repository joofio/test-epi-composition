hormone into the blood stream. </p>
<p>GHRYVELIN is used in adults to test the body s ability to produce growth hormone. It is used when your doctor thinks that you may not have enough growth 
hormone (adult growth hormone deficiency). This is not a treatment for patients who do not have enough growth hormone. It is a test that helps your doctor to 
diagnose this condition. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to macimorelin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given GHRYVELIN. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
To ensure that the test results are reliable, you need to follow the rules below: 
* Fasting - you must not eat for at least 8 hours before the test, and during the test. 
* Physical exercise - avoid strenuous physical activity 24 hours before the test. 
* Drinking - up to 100 mL of still water is allowed each within 1 hour before as well as within 1 hour after macimorelin intake. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if: 
* you have recently been treated with growth hormone (somatotropin) or with medicines that affect the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. 
You need to stop such treatment at least 1 month before the test. 
* you have recently been treated for Cushing s disease (disorder which results in high levels of the hormone cortisol) or if you are receiving a high dose of 
hydrocortisone medicine, the test may lead to false positive test results. 
* your body is lacking any other hormone e.g. cortisol, thyroid or sex hormones, vasopressin (in diabetes insipidus), this should be adequately replaced 
before testing for growth hormone deficiency. Other hormone deficiencies if untreated could lead to inaccurate results in the growth hormone stimulation 
test. 
* you have heart disease or problems with your heart rhythm (including congenital or acquired long QT syndrome or a history of so called torsades de 
pointes tachycardias). GHRYVELIN can cause changes in the ECG (electrocardiogram) including QT prolongation that are associated with an increased 
risk for arrhythmias. If occurring, such changes would be timely limited and not last long. </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>GHRYVELIN is indicated as a single-dose diagnostic test. No information is available on the safety and effects of macimorelin during long-term use. 
Potentially re-test needed in early disease 
If the adult growth hormone deficiency just recently started and if it is due to an injury in a section of the brain called hypothalamus, then the test result could 
be negative although you have the disease. In such a situation, a repetition of the test may be required. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
GHRYVELIN must not be used in children and adolescents aged below 18 years, because the safety and effectiveness in these groups have not yet been 
established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and GHRYVELIN 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that can alter your heart rhythm, such as: 
* medicines to treat psychosis (such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol) 
* medicines to treat infections (antibiotics such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, moxifloxacin) 
* medicines to correct the heart rhythm (antiarrhythmic medicines such as amiodarone, procainamide, quinidine or sotalol) 
* any other medicines that can prolong the QT interval or inducing torsades de pointes </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that could increase the breakdown of macimorelin such as specific medicines to treat: 
* seizures/epilepsy (carbamazepine, esclicarbazepine, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone) 
* sleep disorder (modafinil, pitolisant) 
* mild to moderate depressive episodes (St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) 
* cystic fibrosis (lumacaftor) 
* infections (antibiotics such as rifabutin, rifampicin) 
* HIV (efavirenz, nevirapine) 
* type 2 diabetes (pioglitazone) 
* cancer (dabrafenib, enzalutamide) </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that may impact the accuracy of the diagnostic test. Avoid concomitant use with medicines: 
* that could have a direct influence on growth hormone secretion by the pituitary gland: such as somatostatin, insulin, glucocorticoids, acetylsalicylic acid, 
indometacin 
* that could increase growth hormone levels: such as clonidine, levodopa, insulin 
* that could reduce the growth hormone response to macimorelin such as: atropine, propylthiouracil, growth hormone medicines </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse for advice before this medicine is 
given to you. GHRYVELIN is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are a woman able to have children, you must use effective contraceptive methods 
to ensure you are not pregnant at the time of the test. If you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Please 
ask your doctor whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from the macimorelin test. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness can occur with GHRYVELIN. If this happens, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>GHRYVELIN contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>GHRYVELIN contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say it is essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
