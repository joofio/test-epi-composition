<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to angiotensin II or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor or nurse should be told if any of the above applies to you before this medicine is used. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
GIAPREZA has only been tested in people with septic and distributive shock. It has not been tested in 
other types of shock. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse should be told before GIAPREZA is used if you or someone else in your family 
have a history of blood clots, as this medicine has been associated with the formation of blood clots. 
As a part of your treatment, you may be given medicine to prevent the formation of blood clots. </p>
<p>When you are first given GIAPREZA, it is expected that your blood pressure will increase. You will 
be monitored closely to make sure that your blood pressure is at the right level. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience a change of colour (redness or paleness), pain, 
numbness in any of your limbs, or if any of your limbs are cold to the touch, as these could be signs 
that a blood clot has blocked blood flow to a part of the body. </p>
<p>Elderly 
GIAPREZA was tested in a small number of patients more than 75 years of age. There are no dose 
adjustments needed for patients more than 75 years of age. Your doctor will monitor your blood 
pressure and adjust your dose as needed. </p>
<p>Impairment of liver or kidneys 
There are no dose adjustments needed for patients with impairment of the function of the liver or 
kidneys. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure and adjust your dose as needed. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
GIAPREZA should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age as it has not been 
studied in these age groups.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and GIAPREZA 
Your doctor should be told if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>A number of medicines may affect the way GIAPREZA works, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (medicines used to lower blood pressure, with 
active substances whose name usually end in -pril). ACE inhibitors may increase to the effect of 
GIAPREZA. </li>
<li>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (medicines used to lower blood pressure, with active 
substances whose names usually end in -sartan) may lessen the effect of GIAPREZA. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may already be giving you other medicines used to increase your blood pressure. Adding 
GIAPREZA to these medicines may require that the doses of the other medicines be lowered. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Your doctor should be told if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are 
planning to have a baby before this medicine is given. </p>
<p>There is limited information about the effects of GIAPREZA during pregnancy. Use of this medicine 
during pregnancy should be avoided if possible. You will only be given this medicine if the possible 
benefit is greater than the possible risks. </p>
<p>It is not known whether GIAPREZA can pass into breast milk. Your doctor should be told if you are 
breast-feeding before this medicine is given. </p>
<p>It is not known whether GIAPREZA can affect fertility. </p>
<p>Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2.5 mg/1 ml, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>GIAPREZA will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor or a nurse. It is first diluted and then given 
as a drip (infusion) into a vein, supplying a specified dose each minute. </p>
<p>The dose depends on your body weight. The recommended starting rate of GIAPREZA is 
20 nanograms (ng) per kilogram of your body weight per minute. After the initial dose, your doctor 
will adjust the rate as often as every 5 minutes until you achieve your target blood pressure. Your 
doctor will continue to assess your response and will adjust the dose accordingly up to a maximum of 
80 ng per kilogram each minute during the first 3 hours of treatment. The maximum dose after the first 
3 hours will be 40 ng per kilogram each minute. </p>
<p>GIAPREZA will be given to you at the lowest dose that helps you to achieve or maintain your blood 
pressure. In order to minimise the risk of side effects to this medicine, GIAPREZA will be withdrawn 
as soon as your condition improves. </p>
<p>If you are given more GIAPREZA than you should 
GIAPREZA will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong 
dose. However, if you have side effects or think you have been given too much GIAPREZA, tell your 
doctor or nurse straight away. If you have too much GIAPREZA, you may experience high blood 
pressure. If this occurs, hospital staff will monitor your vital signs and you will be provided with 
supportive care.  </p>
<p>Stopping GIAPREZA treatment 
Your doctor will gradually decrease the amount of GIAPREZA you are given over time once your 
blood pressure has increased to appropriate levels. If GIAPREZA is stopped suddenly or stopped too 
early, you may experience a decrease in your blood pressure or your condition may worsen.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.  </p>         </div>"""

<li>Pain, redness or pale colour, swelling or coolness to the touch of the skin or limbs, as these may 
be symptoms of a blood clot in one of your veins. These clots may travel through blood vessels 
to the lungs causing chest pain and difficulty breathing. If you notice any of these symptoms, 
seek medical advice immediately. These types of symptoms occur in greater than 1 out of every 
10 patients. While not all of these symptoms lead to life-threatening complications, your doctor 
should be told about them immediately. </li>
