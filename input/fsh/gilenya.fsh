Gilenya contains the active substance fingolimod. </p>
<p>What Gilenya is used for 
Gilenya is used in adults and in children and adolescents (10 years of age and above) to treat 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), more specifically in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients who have failed to respond despite treatment with an MS treatment. 
or </li>
<li>Patients who have rapidly evolving severe MS. </li>
</ul>
<p>Gilenya does not cure MS, but it helps to reduce the number of relapses and to slow down the 
progression of physical disabilities due to MS. </p>
<p>What is multiple sclerosis 
MS is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), comprised of the brain and 
spinal cord. In MS inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called myelin) around the nerves in 
the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This is called demyelination. </p>
<p>Relapsing-remitting MS is characterised by repeated attacks (relapses) of nervous system symptoms 
that reflect inflammation within the CNS. Symptoms vary from patient to patient but typically involve 
walking difficulties, numbness, vision problems or disturbed balance. Symptoms of a relapse may 
disappear completely when the relapse is over, but some problems may remain. </p>
<p>How Gilenya works 
Gilenya helps to protect against attacks on the CNS by the immune system by reducing the ability of 
some white blood cells (lymphocytes) to move freely within the body and by stopping them from 
reaching the brain and spinal cord. This limits nerve damage caused by MS. Gilenya also reduces 
some of the immune reactions of your body. </p>         </div>"""

- if you have a lowered immune response (due to an immunodeficiency syndrome, a disease or 
to medicines that suppress the immune system). 
- if you have a severe active infection or active chronic infection such as hepatitis or 
tuberculosis. 
- if you have an active cancer. 
- if you have severe liver problems. 
- if, in the last 6 months, you have had heart attack, angina, stroke or warning of a stroke or 
certain types of heart failure. 
- if you have certain types of irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), including patients 
in whom the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows prolonged QT interval before starting Gilenya. 
- if you are taking or have recently taken medicine for irregular heartbeat such as quinidine, 
disopyramide, amiodarone or sotalol. 
- if you are pregnant or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. 
- if you are allergic to fingolimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If this applies to you or you are unsure, talk to your doctor before taking Gilenya. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Gilenya:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have severe breathing problems during sleep (severe sleep apnoea). </li>
<li>if you have been told you have an abnormal electrocardiogram. </li>
<li>if you suffer from symptoms of slow heart rate (e.g. dizziness, nausea, or palpitations). </li>
<li>if you are taking or have recently taken medicines that slow your heart rate (such as beta 
blockers, verapamil, diltiazem or ivabradine, digoxin, anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine). </li>
<li>if you have a history of sudden loss of consciousness or fainting (syncope). </li>
<li>if you plan to get vaccinated. </li>
<li>if you have never had chickenpox. </li>
<li>if you have or have had visual disturbances or other signs of swelling in the central vision 
area (macula) at the back of the eye (a condition known as macular oedema, see below), 
inflammation or infection of the eye (uveitis), or if you have diabetes (which can cause eye 
problems). </li>
<li>if you have liver problems. </li>
<li>if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicines. </li>
<li>if you have severe lung problems or smoker s cough. 
If any of these applies to you or you are unsure, talk to your doctor before taking Gilenya. </li>
</ul>
<p>Slow heart rate (bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat 
At the beginning of treatment or after taking the first dose of 0.5 mg when you switch from a 0.25 mg 
daily dose, Gilenya causes the heart rate to slow down. As a result, you may feel dizzy or tired, or be 
consciously aware of your heartbeat, or your blood pressure may drop. If these effects are severe, tell 
your doctor, because you may need treatment right away. Gilenya can also cause an irregular 
heartbeat, especially after the first dose. Irregular heartbeat usually returns to normal in less than one 
day. Slow heart rate usually returns to normal within one month. During this period, no clinically 
significant heart rate effects are usually expected. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to stay at the surgery or clinic for at least 6 hours, with hourly pulse and 
blood pressure measurements, after taking the first dose of Gilenya or after taking the first dose of 
0.5 mg when you switch from a 0.25 mg daily dose, so that appropriate measures can be taken in the 
event of side effects that occur at the start of treatment. You should have an electrocardiogram 
performed prior to the first dose of Gilenya and after the 6-hour monitoring period. Your doctor may 
monitor your electrocardiogram continuously during that time. If after the 6-hour period you have a 
very slow or decreasing heart rate, or if your electrocardiogram shows abnormalities, you may need to 
be monitored for a longer period (at least 2 more hours and possibly overnight) until these have 
resolved. The same may apply if you are resuming Gilenya after a break in treatment, depending on 
both how long the break was and how long you had been taking Gilenya before the break. </p>
<p>If you have, or if you are at risk for, an irregular or abnormal heartbeat, if your electrocardiogram is 
abnormal, or if you have heart disease or heart failure, Gilenya may not be appropriate for you. </p>
<p>If you have a history of sudden loss of consciousness or decreased heart rate, Gilenya may not be 
appropriate for you. You will be evaluated by a cardiologist (heart specialist) to advise how you 
should start treatment with Gilenya, including overnight monitoring. </p>
<p>If you are taking medicines that can cause your heart rate to decrease, Gilenya may not be appropriate 
for you. You will need to be evaluated by a cardiologist, who will check whether you can be switched 
to alternative medicine that does not decrease your heart rate in order to allow treatment with Gilenya. 
If such a switch is impossible, the cardiologist will advise how you should start treatment with 
Gilenya, including overnight monitoring. </p>
<p>If you have never had chickenpox 
If you have never had chickenpox, your doctor will check your immunity against the virus that causes 
it (varicella zoster virus). If you are not protected against the virus, you may need a vaccination before 
you start treatment with Gilenya. If this is the case, your doctor will delay the start of treatment with 
Gilenya until one month after the full course of vaccination is completed. </p>
<p>Infections 
Gilenya lowers the white blood cell count (particularly the lymphocyte count). White blood cells fight 
infection. While you are taking Gilenya (and for up to 2 months after you stop taking it), you may get 
infections more easily. Any infection that you already have may get worse. Infections could be serious 
and life-threatening. If you think you have an infection, have fever, feel like you have the flu, have 
shingles or have a headache accompanied by stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea, rash, and/or 
confusion or seizures (fits) (these may be symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis caused by a 
fungal or herpes viral infection), contact your doctor straight away, because it could be serious and 
life-threatening. </p>
<p>If you believe your MS is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you notice any new 
symptoms, talk to your doctor straight away, because these may be the symptoms of a rare brain 
disorder caused by infection and called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a 
serious condition that may lead to severe disability or death. Your doctor will consider performing an 
MRI scan to evaluate this condition and will decide whether you need to stop taking Gilenya. </p>
<p>Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including papilloma, dysplasia, warts and HPV-related 
cancer, has been reported in patients treated with Gilenya. Your doctor will consider whether you need 
to have a vaccination against HPV before starting treatment. If you are a woman, your doctor will also 
recommend HPV screening. </p>
<p>Macular oedema 
Before you start Gilenya, if you have or have had visual disturbances or other signs of swelling in the 
central vision area (macula) at the back of the eye, inflammation or infection of the eye (uveitis) or 
diabetes, your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination. </p>
<p>Your doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination 3 to 4 months after starting Gilenya 
treatment. </p>
<p>The macula is a small area of the retina at the back of the eye which enables you to see shapes, 
colours, and details clearly and sharply. Gilenya may cause swelling in the macula, a condition that is 
known as macular oedema. The swelling usually happens in the first 4 months of Gilenya treatment. </p>
<p>Your chance of developing macular oedema is higher if you have diabetes or have had an 
inflammation of the eye called uveitis. In these cases your doctor will want you to undergo regular eye 
examinations in order to detect macular oedema. </p>
<p>If you have had macular oedema, talk to your doctor before you resume treatment with Gilenya. </p>
<p>Macular oedema can cause some of the same vision symptoms as an MS attack (optic neuritis). Early 
on, there may not be any symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor about any changes in your vision. Your 
doctor may want you to undergo an eye examination, especially if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the centre of your vision gets blurry or has shadows; </li>
<li>you develop a blind spot in the centre of your vision; </li>
<li>you have problems seeing colours or fine detail. </li>
</ul>
<p>Liver function tests 
If you have severe liver problems, you should not take Gilenya. Gilenya may affect your liver 
function. You will probably not notice any symptoms but if you notice yellowing of your skin or the 
whites of your eyes, abnormally dark urine (brown coloured), pain on the right side of your stomach 
area (abdomen), tiredness, feeling less hungry than usual or unexplained nausea and vomiting, tell 
your doctor straight away. 
If you get any of these symptoms after starting Gilenya, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Before, during and after the treatment, your doctor will request blood tests to monitor your liver 
function. If your test results indicate a problem with your liver you may have to interrupt treatment 
with Gilenya. </p>
<p>High blood pressure 
As Gilenya causes a slight elevation of blood pressure, your doctor may want to check your blood 
pressure regularly. </p>
<p>Lung problems 
Gilenya has a slight effect on the lung function. Patients with severe lung problems or with smoker s 
cough may have a higher chance of developing side effects. </p>
<p>Blood count 
The desired effect of Gilenya treatment is to reduce the amount of white blood cells in your blood. 
This will usually go back to normal within 2 months of stopping treatment. If you need to have any 
blood tests, tell the doctor that you are taking Gilenya. Otherwise, it may not be possible for the doctor 
to understand the results of the test, and for certain types of blood test your doctor may need to take 
more blood than usual. </p>
<p>Before you start Gilenya, your doctor will confirm whether you have enough white blood cells in your 
blood and may want to repeat a check regularly. In case you do not have enough white blood cells, 
you may have to interrupt treatment with Gilenya. </p>
<p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
A condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been rarely reported in 
MS patients treated with Gilenya. Symptoms may include sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, 
seizures and vision changes. Tell your doctor straight away if you experience any of these symptoms 
during your treatment with Gilenya, because it could be serious. </p>
<p>Cancer 
Skin cancers have been reported in MS patients treated with Gilenya. Talk to your doctor straight 
away if you notice any skin nodules (e.g. shiny pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not heal 
within weeks. Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin tissue (e.g. 
unusual moles) with a change in colour, shape or size over time. Before you start Gilenya, a skin 
examination is required to check whether you have any skin nodules. Your doctor will also carry out 
regular skin examinations during your treatment with Gilenya. If you develop problems with your 
skin, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after consultation may decide that it is 
important for you to be seen on a regular basis. </p>
<p>A type of cancer of the lymphatic system (lymphoma) has been reported in MS patients treated with 
Gilenya. </p>
<p>Exposure to the sun and protection against the sun 
Fingolimod weakens your immune system. This increases your risk of developing cancers, in 
particular skin cancers. You should limit your exposure to the sun and UV rays by: 
* wearing appropriate protective clothing. 
* regularly applying sunscreen with a high degree of UV protection. </p>
<p>Unusual brain lesions associated with MS relapse 
Rare cases of unusually large brain lesions associated with MS relapse have been reported in patients 
treated with Gilenya. In case of severe relapse, your doctor will consider performing MRI to evaluate 
this condition and will decide whether you need to stop taking Gilenya. </p>
<p>Switch from other treatments to Gilenya 
Your doctor may switch you directly from beta interferon, glatiramer acetate or dimethyl fumarate to 
Gilenya if there are no signs of abnormalities caused by your previous treatment. Your doctor may 
have to do a blood test in order to exclude such abnormalities. After stopping natalizumab you may 
have to wait for 2-3 months before starting treatment with Gilenya. To switch from teriflunomide, 
your doctor may advise you to wait for a certain time or to go through an accelerated elimination 
procedure. If you have been treated with alemtuzumab, a thorough evaluation and discussion with 
your doctor is required to decide if Gilenya is appropriate for you. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential 
If used during pregnancy, Gilenya can harm the unborn baby. Before you start treatment with Gilenya 
your doctor will explain the risk to you and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you 
are not pregnant. Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become 
pregnant while taking Gilenya. It also explains what you should do to avoid becoming pregnant while 
you are taking Gilenya. You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 months after 
stopping treatment (see section  Pregnancy and breastfeeding ). </p>
<p>Worsening of MS after stopping Gilenya treatment 
Do not stop taking Gilenya or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS is getting worse after you have stopped treatment 
with Gilenya. This could be serious (see  If you stop taking Gilenya  in section 3, and also section 4, 
 Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>Elderly 
Experience with Gilenya in elderly patients (over 65 years) is limited. Talk to your doctor if you have 
any concerns. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Gilenya is not intended for use in children below 10 years old as it has not been studied in MS patients 
in this age group. </p>
<p>The warnings and precautions listed above also apply to children and adolescents. The following 
information is particularly important for children and adolescents and their caregivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you start Gilenya, your doctor will check your vaccination status. If you have not had 
certain vaccinations, it may be necessary for you to be given them before Gilenya can be started. </li>
<li>The first time you take Gilenya, or when you switch from a 0.25 mg daily dose to a 0.5 mg daily 
dose, your doctor will monitor your heart rate and heartbeat (see  Slow heart rate (bradycardia) 
and irregular heartbeat  above). </li>
<li>If you experience convulsions or fits before or whilst taking Gilenya, let your doctor know. </li>
<li>If you suffer from depression or anxiety or if you become depressed or anxious while you are 
taking Gilenya, let your doctor know. You may need to be monitored more closely. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Gilenya 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* Medicines that suppress or modulate the immune system, including other medicines used 
to treat MS, such as beta interferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, 
teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab. You must not use Gilenya together with such 
medicines as this could intensify the effect on the immune system (see also  Do not take 
Gilenya ). 
* Corticosteroids, due to a possible added effect on the immune system. 
* Vaccines. If you need to receive a vaccine, seek your doctor s advice first. During and for up to 
2 months after treatment with Gilenya, you should not receive certain types of vaccine (live 
attenuated vaccines) as they could trigger the infection that they were supposed to prevent. 
Other vaccines may not work as well as usual if given during this period. 
* Medicines that slow the heartbeat (for example beta blockers, such as atenolol). Use of 
Gilenya together with such medicines could intensify the effect on heartbeat in the first days 
after starting Gilenya. 
* Medicines for irregular heartbeat, such as quinidine, disopyramide, amiodarone or sotalol. 
You must not use Gilenya if you are taking such a medicine because it could intensify the effect 
on irregular heartbeat (see also  Do not take Gilenya ). 
* Other medicines: * 
protease inhibitors, anti-infectives such as ketoconazole, azole antifungals, clarithromycin 
or telithromycin. * 
carbamazepine, rifampicine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, efavirenz or St. John s Wort 
(potential risk of reduced efficacy of Gilenya). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not use Gilenya during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman who 
could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. If Gilenya is used during 
pregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. The rate of congenital malformations observed 
in babies exposed to Gilenya during pregnancy is about 2 times the rate observed in the general 
population (in whom the rate of congenital malformations is about 2-3%). The most frequently 
reported malformations included cardiac, renal and musculoskeletal malformations. </p>
<p>Therefore, if you are a woman of childbearing potential:</p>
<ul>
<li>before you start treatment with Gilenya your doctor will inform you about the risk to an unborn 
baby and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant, 
and, </li>
<li>you must use effective contraception while taking Gilenya and for two months after you stop 
taking it to avoid becoming pregnant. Talk to your doctor about reliable methods of 
contraception. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become pregnant while taking 
Gilenya. </p>
<p>If you do become pregnant while taking Gilenya, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
decide to stop treatment (see  If you stop taking Gilenya  in section 3, and also section 4,  Possible 
side effects ). Specialised pre-natal monitoring will be performed. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed while you are taking Gilenya. Gilenya can pass into breast milk and 
there is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles, including a bicycle, and 
use machines safely. Gilenya is not expected to have an influence on your ability to drive and use 
machines. </p>
<p>However, at initiation of treatment you will have to stay at the doctor s surgery or clinic for 6 hours 
after taking the first dose of Gilenya. Your ability to drive and use machines may be impaired during 
and potentially after this time period. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Adults: 
The dose is one 0.5 mg capsule per day. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (10 years of age and above): 
The dose depends on body weight: 
* Children and adolescents with body weight equal to or below 40 kg: one 0.25 mg capsule per 
day. 
* Children and adolescents with body weight above 40 kg: one 0.5 mg capsule per day. 
Children and adolescents who start on one 0.25 mg capsule per day and later reach a stable body 
weight above 40 kg will be instructed by their doctor to switch to one 0.5 mg capsule per day. In this 
case, it is recommended to repeat the first-dose observation period. </p>
<p>Do not exceed the recommended dose. </p>
<p>Gilenya is for oral use. </p>
<p>Take Gilenya once a day with a glass of water. Gilenya capsules should always be swallowed intact, 
without opening them. Gilenya can be taken with or without food. 
Taking Gilenya at the same time each day will help you remember when to take your medicine. </p>
<p>If you have questions about how long to take Gilenya, talk to your doctor or your pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you take more Gilenya than you should 
If you have taken too much Gilenya, call your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Gilenya 
If you have been taking Gilenya for less than 1 month and you forget to take 1 dose for a whole day, 
call your doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor may decide to keep you under observation 
at the time you take the next dose. </p>
<p>If you have been taking Gilenya for at least 1 month and have forgotten to take your treatment for 
more than 2 weeks, call your doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor may decide to keep 
you under observation at the time you take the next dose. However, if you have forgotten to take your 
treatment for up to 2 weeks, you can take the next dose as planned. </p>
<p>Never take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Gilenya 
Do not stop taking Gilenya or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Gilenya will stay in your body for up to 2 months after you stop taking it. Your white blood cell count 
(lymphocyte count) may also remain low during this time and the side effects described in this leaflet 
may still occur. After stopping Gilenya you may have to wait for 6-8 weeks before starting a new MS 
treatment. </p>
<p>If you have to restart Gilenya more than 2 weeks after you stop taking it, the effect on heart rate 
normally seen when treatment is first started may re-occur and you will need to be monitored at the 
doctor s surgery or clinic for re-initiation of treatment. Do not restart Gilenya after stopping it for 
more than two weeks without seeking advice from your doctor. </p>

- A condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Symptoms may 
include sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and/or vision disturbances 
- Lymphoma (a type of cancer that affects the lymph system) 
- Squamous cell carcinoma: a type of skin cancer which may present as a firm red nodule, a sore 
with crust, or a new sore on an existing scar </p>
<p>Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) 
- Electrocardiogram anomaly (T-wave inversion) 
- Tumour related to infection with human herpes virus 8 (Kaposi s sarcoma) </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
- Allergic reactions, including symptoms of rash or itchy hives, swelling of lips, tongue or face, 
which are more likely to occur on the day you start Gilenya treatment 
- Signs of liver disease (including liver failure), such as yellowing of your skin or the whites of 
your eyes (jaundice), nausea or vomiting, pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen), 
dark urine (brown coloured), feeling less hungry than usual, tiredness and abnormal liver 
function tests. In a very small number of cases, liver failure could lead to liver transplantation 
- Risk of a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The 
symptoms of PML may be similar to an MS relapse. Symptoms might also arise that you might 
not become aware of by yourself, such as changes in mood or behaviour, memory lapses, speech 
and communication difficulties, which your doctor may need to investigate further to rule out 
PML. Therefore, if you believe your MS is getting worse or if you or those close to you notice 
any new or unusual symptoms, it is very important that you speak to your doctor as soon as 
possible 
- Cryptococcal infections (a type of fungal infection), including cryptococcal meningitis with 
symptoms such as headache accompanied by stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea, and/or 
confusion 
- Merkel cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer). Possible signs of Merkel cell carcinoma include 
flesh-coloured or bluish-red, painless nodule, often on the face, head or neck. Merkel cell 
carcinoma can also present as a firm painless nodule or mass. Long-term exposure to the sun 
and a weak immune system can affect the risk of developing Merkel cell carcinoma. 
- After Gilenya treatment is stopped, symptoms of MS can return and may become worse than 
they were before or during treatment. 
- Autoimmune form of anaemia (decreased amount of red blood cells) where red blood cells are 
destroyed (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia). </p>
<p>If you experience any of these, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
