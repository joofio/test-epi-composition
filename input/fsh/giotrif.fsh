ErbB1], HER2 [ErbB2], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of 
cancer cells, and can be affected by changes (mutations) in the genes that produce them. By blocking 
the activity of these proteins this medicine can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells.
This medicine is used on its own to treat adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung 
(non-small cell lung cancer):</p>

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine:</p>
<p>if you are female, have a low body weight of less than 50 kg or have kidney problems. If any of 
these apply to you, your doctor may monitor you more closely as the side effects may be more 
pronounced.</p>
<p>if you have a history of lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease).</p>
<p>if you have liver problems. Your doctor may do some liver tests. Treatment with this medicine 
is not recommended if you have a severe liver disease.</p>
<p>if you have a history of eye problems such as severe dry eyes, inflammation of the transparent 
layer at the front of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the outer part of the eye, or if you use 
contact lenses.</p>
<p>if you have a history of heart problems. Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely.
Inform your doctor immediately while taking this medicine:</p>
<p>if you develop diarrhoea. Treatment at the first signs of diarrhoea is important.</p>
<p>if you develop skin rash. Early treatment of skin rash is important.</p>
<p>if you develop new or sudden worsening of shortness of breath, possibly with a cough or fever. 
These could be symptoms of an inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) and can be 
life-threatening.</p>
<p>if you have severe pain in your stomach or intestines, fever, chills, sickness, vomiting, or 
abdominal rigidity or bloating, as these could be symptoms of a tear in the wall of your stomach 
or intestines ( gastrointestinal perforation ). Also, tell your doctor if you had gastrointestinal 
ulcers or diverticular disease in the past, or are concomitantly treated with anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) (used to treat pain relief and swelling) or steroids (used for inflammation and 
allergies), as this may increase this risk.</p>
<p>if you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred 
vision and/or sensitivity to light. You may need urgent treatment.
See also section 4  Possible side effects .

Other medicines and GIOTRIF
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal medicines and medicines obtained without a prescription.
In particular, if taken before GIOTRIF, the following medicines may increase the blood levels of 
GIOTRIF and therefore the risk of side effects. They should therefore be taken as far apart in time as 
possible from GIOTRIF. This means preferably 6 hours (for medicines taken twice daily) or 12 hours
(for medicines taken once daily) apart from GIOTRIF:</p>
<p>Ritonavir, ketoconazole (except in shampoo), itraconazole, erythromycin, nelfinavir, saquinavir
  used to treat different kinds of infections.</p>
<p>Verapamil, quinidine, amiodarone   used to treat heart conditions.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine A, tacrolimus   medicines that affect your immune system.
The following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of GIOTRIF:</p>
<p>Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital   used to treat seizures.</p>
<p>St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine to treat depression.</p>
<p>Rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis.
Ask your doctor if you are unsure of when to take these medicines.
GIOTRIF may increase the blood levels of other medicines including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Sulfasalazine, used to treat inflammation/infection.</p>
<p>Rosuvastatin, used for lowering cholesterol.
Tell your doctor before taking these medicines together with GIOTRIF.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy
You should avoid becoming pregnant while taking this medicine. If you could become pregnant, you 
should use adequate birth control methods during treatment and for at least 1 month after taking the 
last dose of this medicine. This is because there may be a risk that an unborn baby is harmed.
If you become pregnant while receiving this medicine, you should immediately inform your doctor. 
Your doctor will decide with you whether treatment should be continued or not.
If you plan to become pregnant after taking the last dose of this medicine, you should ask your doctor 
for advice as your body may not have fully eliminated this medicine.

Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine as a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded.
Driving and using machines
If you experience treatment-related symptoms affecting your eye sight (e.g. redness and/or irritation of 
the eye, dry eye, tearing, light-sensitivity) or your ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended 
that you do not drive or use machines until the side effect disappears (see section 4 Possible side 
effects).
