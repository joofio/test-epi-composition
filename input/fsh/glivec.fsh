  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Glivec is a medicine containing an active substance called imatinib. This medicine works by inhibiting 
the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of cancer. </p>
<p>Glivec is a treatment for adults and children for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white 
cells usually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia 
in which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. </li>
<li>Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). 
Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight 
infection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal 
white cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Glivec inhibits the growth of 
these cells. </li>
</ul>
<p>Glivec is also a treatment for adults for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood 
diseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. Glivec inhibits the growth of 
these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. </li>
<li>Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These 
are blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. 
Glivec inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. </li>
<li>Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). GIST is a cancer of the stomach and bowels. It 
arises from uncontrolled cell growth of the supporting tissues of these organs. </li>
<li>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin 
in which some cells start growing out of control. Glivec inhibits the growth of these cells. 
In the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about how Glivec works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Glivec will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in medicines to treat blood cancers 
or solid tumours. </p>
<p>Follow all your doctor s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information 
contained in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Do not take Glivec 
- if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Glivec. </p>
<p>If you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Glivec:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem. </li>
<li>if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed. </li>
<li>if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Glivec could cause 
hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be carefully 
checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. </li>
<li>if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking Glivec, contact 
your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic microangiopathy 
(TMA). 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Glivec. </li>
</ul>
<p>You may become more sensitive to the sun while taking Glivec. It is important to cover sun-exposed 
areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). These precautions are also 
applicable to children. </p>
<p>During treatment with Glivec, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very quickly. 
Glivec may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention). </p>
<p>While you are taking Glivec, your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is working. You 
will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Glivec is also a treatment for children with CML. There is no experience in children with CML below 
2 years of age. There is limited experience in children with Ph-positive ALL and very limited 
experience in children with MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL. </p>
<p>Some children and adolescents taking Glivec may have slower than normal growth. The doctor will 
monitor the growth at regular visits. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Glivec 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including 
herbal medicines (such as St. John s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Glivec 
when taken together. They may increase or decrease the effect of Glivec, either leading to increased 
side effects or making Glivec less effective. Glivec may do the same to some other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
- Glivec is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm your 
baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Glivec during pregnancy. 
- Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during treatment 
and for 15 days after ending treatment. 
- Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Glivec and for 15 days after ending treatment, as it 
may harm your baby. 
- Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Glivec are advised to consult with 
their doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not 
drive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Your doctor has prescribed Glivec because you suffer from a serious condition. Glivec can help you to 
fight this condition. </p>
<p>However, always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. It is important 
that you do this as long as your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Glivec unless your doctor tells you to. If you are not able to take the medicine as 
your doctor prescribed or you feel you do not need it anymore, contact your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>How much Glivec to take </p>
<p>Use in adults 
Your doctor will tell you exactly how many capsules of Glivec to take. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for CML: 
Depending on your condition the usual starting dose is either 400 mg or 600 mg:</p>
<ul>
<li>400 mg to be taken as 4 capsules once a day. </li>
<li>600 mg to be taken as 6 capsules once a day. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are being treated for GIST: 
The starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as 4 capsules once a day. </p>
<p>For CML and GIST, your doctor may prescribe a higher or lower dose depending on how you respond 
to treatment. If your daily dose is 800 mg (8 capsules), you should take 4 capsules in the morning and 
4 capsules in the evening. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for Ph-positive ALL: 
The starting dose is 600 mg to be taken as 6 capsules once a day. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for MDS/MPD: 
The starting dose is 400 mg, to be taken as 4 capsules once a day. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for HES/CEL: 
The starting dose is 100 mg, to be taken as one capsule once a day. Your doctor may decide to 
increase the dose to 400 mg, to be taken as 4 capsules once a day, depending on how you 
respond to treatment. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for DFSP: 
The dose is 800 mg per day (8 capsules), to be taken as 4 capsules in the morning and 
4 capsules in the evening. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
The doctor will tell you how many capsules of Glivec to give to your child. The amount of Glivec 
given will depend on your child s condition, body weight and height. The total daily dose in children 
must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The treatment can either be given to 
your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be split into two administrations 
(half in the morning and half in the evening). </p>
<p>When and how to take Glivec 
- Take Glivec with a meal. This will help protect you from stomach problems when taking 
Glivec. 
- Swallow the capsules whole with a large glass of water. Do not open or crush the capsules 
unless you have difficulty in swallowing (e.g. in children). 
- If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you can open them up and pour the powder into a 
glass of still water or apple juice. 
- If you are a woman who is pregnant or might get pregnant and are trying to open the capsules, 
you should handle the contents with caution in order to avoid skin-eye contact or inhalation. 
You should wash your hands immediately after opening the capsules. </p>
<p>How long to take Glivec 
Keep taking Glivec every day for as long as your doctor tells you. </p>
<p>If you take more Glivec than you should 
If you have accidentally taken too many capsules, talk to your doctor straight away. You may require 
medical attention. Take the medicine pack with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Glivec 
- If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However if it is nearly time for the next 
dose, skip the missed dose. 
- Then continue with your normal schedule. 
- Do not take a double dose to make up a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
