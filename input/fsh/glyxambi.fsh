  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Glyxambi is 
Glyxambi contains two active substances called empagliflozin and linagliptin. Each belongs to a group 
of medicines called  oral anti-diabetics . These are medicines taken by mouth to treat type 2 diabetes.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. If you have type 2 
diabetes, your pancreas may not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, and 
your body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. This results in high levels of sugar in your 
blood, which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor 
circulation in your limbs.
How Glyxambi works
Empagliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors. It works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar (glucose)
to be removed in your urine. Linagliptin works in a different way, namely by enabling the pancreas to 
produce more insulin to lower blood glucose levels. It does this by blocking a protein called DPP-4. Thereby Glyxambi lowers the amount of sugar in your blood. 
What Glyxambi is used for</p>
<p>Glyxambi is added to metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) to treat type 2 diabetes in adult 
patients aged 18 years and older whose diabetes cannot be controlled when treated with metformin 
and/or sulphonylurea in combination with empagliflozin, or when treated with metformin and/or 
sulphonylurea in combination with linagliptin.</p>
<p>Glyxambi can also be used as an alternative to taking both empagliflozin and linagliptin as single 
tablets. To avoid overdose, do not continue taking empagliflozin and linagliptin tablets separately, 
if your are taking this medicine.
It is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as recommended by your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to empagliflozin, linagliptin, any other SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g. dapagliflozin, 
canagliflozin), any other DPP-4 inhibitor (e.g. sitagliptin, vildagliptin), or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, before taking this medicine, and during treatment:</p>
<p>if you have  type 1 diabetes . This type usually starts when you are young and your body does
not produce any insulin. You should not take Glyxambi if you have type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. Contact a 
doctor or the nearest hospital straight away as these symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic 
ketoacidosis    a rare, but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with 
diabetes because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The 
risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive 
alcohol consumption, dehydration or sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of 
insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.</p>
<p>if you are taking other anti-diabetic medicines known as  sulphonylurea  (e.g. glimepiride, 
glipizide) and/or using insulin. Your doctor may want to reduce your dose of these medicines
when you take them together with Glyxambi, in order to avoid too low blood sugar
(hypoglycaemia).</p>
<p>if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.</p>
<p>if you have serious kidney problems. Your doctor may limit your daily dose or ask you to take a 
different medicine (see also section 3,  How to take Glyxambi ).</p>
<p>if you have serious liver problems. Your doctor may ask you to take a different medicine.</p>
<p>if you might be at risk of dehydration, for example:<em> if you are being sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink</em> if you are taking medicines that increase urine production [diuretics] or lower blood 
pressure* if you are over 75 years old
Possible signs are listed in section 4 under  dehydration . Your doctor may ask you to stop 
taking Glyxambi until you recover to prevent loss of too much body fluid. Ask about ways to 
prevent dehydration. </p>
<p>if you have an increase in the proportion of red blood cells in your blood (haematocrit), seen in 
laboratory blood tests (see also section 4,  Possible side effects ).
Contact your doctor if you experience any of the following during treatment with Glyxambi:</p>
<p>if you develop symptoms of acute pancreatitis, like persistent, severe stomach ache (abdominal 
pain). Possible signs are listed in section 4,  Possible side effects . Your doctor may need to 
change your treatment.</p>
<p>if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask 
you to stop taking Glyxambi until you have recovered.</p>
<p>if you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous 
pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to stop Glyxambi.
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling 
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening 
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue 
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Foot care
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional.
Kidney function
Before you start treatment with Glyxambi and regularly during treatment, your doctor will check how 
well your kidneys are working.
Urine glucose
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are taking this 
medicine.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years, because it has not 
been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Glyxambi
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are using the following medicines:</p>
<p>other anti-diabetic medicines, such as insulin or a sulphonylurea. Your doctor may want to 
lower the dose of these other medicines, to prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too 
low.</p>
<p>medicines used to remove water from your body (diuretics). Your doctor may ask you to stop 
taking Glyxambi.</p>
<p>medicines that might have an effect on the break down of empagliflozin or linagliptin in your 
body such as rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis) or certain medicines used to 
treat seizures (such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin). The effect of Glyxambi may 
be reduced.</p>
<p>lithium because Glyxambi can lower the amount of lithium in your blood.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine.
It is not known whether Glyxambi is harmful to the unborn child. As a precautionary measure it is 
preferrable to avoid the use of this medicine during pregnancy.
It is not known whether the active substances of Glyxambi pass into human breast milk. Do not use 
this medicine if you are breast-feeding.
It is not known wheather Glyxambi has an effect on the fertility in humans.
Driving and using machines
Glyxambi has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Taking this medicine in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin, can cause your blood sugar levels 
to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and changes
in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or use any tools or 
machines, if you experience any of these symptoms while taking Glyxambi.</p>         </div>"""

25 mg/5 mg (25 mg empagliflozin and 5 mg linagliptin) once a day. If you already take 25 mg 
empagliflozin and 5 mg linagliptin as separate tablets and you switch to Glyxambi, you can start

alternative medicine.
Hepatic impairment
Talk to your doctor in case you suffer from severe hepatic impairment. Glyxambi is not recommended 
and your doctor may decide to use an alternative medicine.

<p>burning sensation when passing urine</p>
