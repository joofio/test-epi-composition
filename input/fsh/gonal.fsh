<p>GONAL-f contains a medicine called  follitropin alfa . Follitropin alfa is a type of  follicle 
stimulating hormone  (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called  gonadotropins . 
Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility. </p>
<p>What GONAL-f is used for </p>
<p>In adult women, GONAL-f is used: 
* to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called  clomiphene citrate . 
* together with another medicine called  lutropin alfa  ( luteinising hormone  or LH) to help 
release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
* to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
 in vitro fertilisation ,  gamete intra-fallopian transfer  or  zygote intra-fallopian transfer . </p>
<p>In adult men, GONAL-f is used: 
* together with another medicine called  human chorionic gonadotropin  (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Do not use GONAL-f </p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. * if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). </li>
<li>
<p>if you are a woman:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. </p>
</li>
<li>with unexplained vaginal bleeding. </li>
<li>with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. </li>
<li>with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. </li>
<li>
<p>if you are a man:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f. </p>
<p>Porphyria </p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if: 
* your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
* you have stomach, arm or leg pain. </p>
<p>In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) </p>
<p>If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy </p>
<p>When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time ( multiple pregnancy , mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. </p>
<p>Miscarriage </p>
<p>When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. </p>
<p>Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) </p>
<p>If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with GONAL-f treatment. </p>
<p>Men with too much FSH in their blood </p>
<p>If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f 
usually does not work if you have this problem. </p>
<p>If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to 
provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and GONAL-f </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
* If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
* If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a  gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (GnRH) agonist 
or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>GONAL-f contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Using this medicine </p>
<ul>
<li>GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously).  </li>
<li>The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor. </li>
<li>Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself. </li>
<li>If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the 
end of this leaflet called  How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution . </li>
</ul>
<p>How much to use </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU). </p>
<p>Women </p>
<p>If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods. </p>
<ul>
<li>GONAL-f is usually given every day. </li>
<li>If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. </li>
<li>The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU each day. </li>
<li>Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. </li>
<li>The maximum daily dose of GONAL-f is usually not higher than 225 IU. </li>
<li>When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
 recombinant hCG  (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. </li>
</ul>
<p>If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
GONAL-f than before. </p>
<p>If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2,  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. </p>
<p>If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones </p>
<ul>
<li>The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. </li>
<li>You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. </li>
<li>Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you 
get the desired response. </li>
<li>When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
 recombinant hCG  (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor s judgment. </li>
</ul>
<p>If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than 
before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2,  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology </p>
<ul>
<li>The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your 
treatment cycle.  </li>
<li>GONAL-f dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU. </li>
<li>Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. </li>
<li>When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms  recombinant 
hCG  (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. </li>
</ul>
<p>In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then GONAL-f is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The GONAL-f and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU GONAL-f is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  </p>
<p>Men </p>
<ul>
<li>The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG. </li>
<li>You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. </li>
<li>If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more GONAL-f than you should </p>
<p>The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2,  Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). </p>
<p>If you forget to use GONAL-f </p>
<p>If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk 
to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Serious side effects in women </p>
<ul>
<li>Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under  Ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) ). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). </li>
<li>The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). </li>
<li>Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). </li>
<li>Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under  Blood clotting problems ). </li>
