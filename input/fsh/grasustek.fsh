<p>Grasustek contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by 
biotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines and is very 
similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. </p>
<p>Grasustek is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the 
occurrence of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the 
use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are 
important as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of 
chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells 
fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an 
increased risk of infection. </p>
<p>Your doctor has given you Grasustek to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes 
blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Grasustek: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty <br />
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the 
skin that itch. </li>
<li>if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute 
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). </li>
<li>if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: </li>
<li>swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, 
difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of 
tiredness.<br />
         These could be symptoms of condition called “Capillary Leak Syndrome” which causes blood to 
leak from the small blood vessels into your body (see section 4). </li>
<li>If you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a 
problem with your spleen (splenomegaly). </li>
<li>If you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary 
oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung 
infiltration). </li>
<li>If you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) 
or decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot 
(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. </li>
<li>If you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. </li>
<li>if you are a patient with breast cancer or lung cancer, Grasustek in combination with 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may increase your risk of a precancerous blood 
condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a blood cancer called acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML). Symptoms may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding.  </li>
<li>if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the 
face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing. 
These could be signs of a severe allergic reaction. </li>
<li>if you have symptoms of  inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports 
blood from the heart to the body), this has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy 
donors. The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased 
inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience those symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Grasustek can harm the tiny filters inside 
your kidneys (glomerulonephritis). </p>
<p>Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of Grasustek. Stop 
using Grasustek and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described 
in section 4.<br />
You should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or 
are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Grasustek, unless instructed by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Loss of response to pegfilgrastim 
If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, 
your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise pegfilgrastim’s activity. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Grasustek 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Grasustek has not been tested in 
pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: </p>
<ul>
<li>are pregnant or breast-feeding </li>
<li>think you may be pregnant or </li>
<li>are planning to have a baby  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you become pregnant during Grasustek treatment, please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Grasustek. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Grasustek has no or a negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Grasustek contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium 
This medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each 6 mg dose, which is equivalent to 50 mg/ml.<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
