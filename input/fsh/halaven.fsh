a period of 2 to 5 minutes. The dose you will receive is based on your body surface area (expressed in 
squared metres, or m2) which is calculated from your weight and height. The usual dose of 
HALAVEN is 1.23 mg/m2, but this may be adjusted by your doctor based on your blood test results or 
other factors. To ensure that the whole dose of HALAVEN is given it is recommended that a saline 
solution is flushed into the vein after HALAVEN is given. </p>
<p>How often will you be given HALAVEN? 
HALAVEN is usually given on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle. Your doctor will determine how 
many cycles of treatment you should receive. Depending on the results of your blood tests, the doctor 
may need to delay administration of the medicine until the blood tests return to normal. The doctor
