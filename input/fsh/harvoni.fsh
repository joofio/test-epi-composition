<p>Hepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. The active substances in the medicine work together by 
blocking two different proteins that the virus needs to grow and reproduce itself, allowing the infection 
to be permanently eliminated from the body. </p>
<p>Harvoni is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are allergic to ledipasvir, sofosbuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6 of this leaflet). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: </p>
</li>
<li>rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); </li>
<li>St. John s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures); </li>
<li>rosuvastatin (a medicine used to treat high cholesterol). </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these conditions apply to you, do not take Harvoni and tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Your doctor will know if any of the following conditions apply to you. These will be considered 
before treatment with Harvoni is started. 
* other liver problems apart from hepatitis C, for instance 
* if you are awaiting a liver transplant; 
* if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your 
doctor may want to monitor you more closely; 
* kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Harvoni has not been fully tested in 
patients with severe kidney problems; 
* ongoing treatment for HIV infection, since your doctor may want to monitor you more 
closely. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Harvoni if: 
* you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat 
irregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor 
may consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Harvoni is 
needed, you may require additional heart monitoring. 
* you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or 
adjustment of your diabetes medication after starting Harvoni. Some diabetic patients have 
experienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with 
medicines like Harvoni. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines 
for heart problems and during treatment you experience: 
* slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; 
* shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; 
* chest-pain; 
* light-headedness 
* palpitations 
* near fainting or fainting </p>
<p>Blood tests </p>
<p>Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Harvoni. This is so that: 
* Your doctor can decide if you should take Harvoni and for how long; 
* Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C 
virus. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Harvoni in children under 3 
years of age has not yet been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Harvoni </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood. Your doctor 
may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. </p>
<p>Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other 
medications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Harvoni. </p>
<p>If you are not sure about taking any other medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Some medicines should not be taken with Harvoni. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not take any other medicine that contains sofosbuvir, one of the active substances in 
Harvoni. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: </p>
</li>
<li>amiodarone used to treat irregular heartbeats </li>
<li>tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 
used to treat HIV infection </li>
<li>digoxin used to treat heart conditions </li>
<li>dabigatran used to thin the blood </li>
<li>statins used to treat high cholesterol </li>
<li>rifapentine (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis) </li>
<li>oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures) </li>
<li>tipranavir (used to treat HIV infection). </li>
</ul>
<p>Taking Harvoni with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side 
effects worse. Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine 
you are taking. </p>
<ul>
<li>Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, 
heartburn or acid reflux. This includes: </li>
<li>antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate). These should 
be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Harvoni; </li>
<li>proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and 
esomeprazole). These should be taken at the same time as Harvoni. Do not take proton 
pump inhibitors before Harvoni. Your doctor may give you a different medicine or adjust 
the dose of the medicine you are taking; </li>
<li>H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). Your 
doctor may give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of the medicine you are 
taking. 
These medicines can decrease the amount of ledipasvir in your blood. If you are taking one of these 
medicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid 
reflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and contraception </p>
<p>The effects of Harvoni during pregnancy are not known. If you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy must be avoided if Harvoni is taken together with ribavirin. It is very important that you 
read the "Pregnancy" section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ribavirin can be very 
damaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, special precautions in sexual activity must be taken if there is 
any chance for pregnancy to occur. </p>
<ul>
<li>You or your partner must use an effective birth control method during treatment with Harvoni 
together with ribavirin and for some time afterwards. It is very important that you read the 
 Pregnancy  section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for an 
effective contraceptive method suitable for you. </li>
<li>If you or your partner become pregnant during Harvoni and ribavirin treatment or in the months 
that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Harvoni. It is not known whether ledipasvir or 
sofosbuvir, the two active substances of Harvoni, pass into human breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>If you feel tired after taking Harvoni you should not take part in activities that require concentration, 
for example, do not drive, ride a bike or operate machines. </p>
<p>Harvoni 90 mg/400 mg and 45 mg/200 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose 
* If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact 
your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>Harvoni 90 mg/400 mg film-coated tablets contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) which can cause 
allergic reactions<br />
* Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sunset yellow FCF, also called  E110  before taking 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Harvoni contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
