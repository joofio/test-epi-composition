of 12 and adults to determine the presence of bacterium Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. </p>
<p>Why do you need to take the Helicobacter Test INFAI? 
You may have a gastric infection caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Your doctor has 
recommended that you have a Helicobacter Test INFAI for one of the following reasons: </p>
<p>Your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from Helicobacter pylori infection to 
help diagnose your condition. </p>
<p>You have already been determined as being infected with Helicobacter pylori and have been 
taking medication aimed to clear up the infection. Your doctor now wishes to find out if the 
treatment has been successful. </p>
<p>How does the test work? 
All foods contain a substance called carbon-13 (13C). This carbon-13 can be detected in the carbon 
dioxide you breathe out of your lungs. The actual amount of carbon-13 in the breath will depend on 
the kind of food that you have eaten. </p>
<p>You will be asked to drink the  test meal . Following the meal, samples of your breath will be taken. 
See  Special instructions for use . These samples will be analysed to measure the  normal  amount of 
carbon-13 content in the carbon dioxide in your breath. </p>
<p>You will then be asked to drink a solution of carbon-13-urea. Further samples of your breath will then 
be taken 30 minutes later and the amount of carbon-13 in the samples measured as before. The results 
will be compared and a significant increase in the amount of carbon-13 in the second set of samples 
will suggest to your doctor that Helicobacter pylori is present. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Helicobacter Test INFAI 
* if you have or suspect that you have a stomach infection or a certain inflammation of the 
stomach lining (atrophic gastritis). 
This inflammation of the stomach lining may cause incorrect positive results of your breath test. 
Further investigations may be required to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Helicobacter Test INFAI if you have any condition 
that can affect or be affected by the test. </p>
<p>Even if the result of Helicobacter Test INFAI is positive, further tests might be necessary before a 
treatment of a Helicobacter pylori infection may be started. These are required to check for the 
presence of any other complications, such as: 
* stomach ulcer 
* inflammation of the stomach lining caused by immune system 
* tumours </p>
<p>There is insufficient data on the reliability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI for recommending its use in 
patients with removal of parts of the stomach. </p>
<p>If the patient vomits during the test procedure, repetition of the test is necessary. This should be done 
in fasted condition and not before the following day. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Helicobacter Test INFAI 
Helicobacter Test INFAI is influenced by medicines influencing<br />
* Helicobacter pylori (see section 3, second paragraph under  Method of use ) 
* the enzyme urease, which stimulate the reduction of urea </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not expected that performing the breath test during pregnancy and lactation has a damaging effect. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Helicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. </p>
<p>You should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 
Patients from the age of 12 must take the content of one jar for one test. </p>
<p>Method of use 
You must have fasted for 6 hours before application, preferably overnight. Ask your doctor, if fasting 
is a problem, for example for diabetic patients. </p>
<p>The test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes. </p>
<p>The test should be performed following at least: 
* 4 weeks after a therapy against a bacterial infection<br />
* 2 weeks after the last administration of a medicine to reduce release of stomach acid 
Both groups of medicines could influence the results of the Helicobacter Test INFAI. This is 
particularly after a therapy to remove Helicobacter pylori. It is important to follow the instructions for 
use exactly, otherwise the result may be questionable. </p>
<p>Essential items not supplied with Helicobacter Test INFAI 
Before the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay the stomach from emptying. The 
test meal is not provided within the kit. The following are suitable test meals: 
* 200 ml 100 % orange juice or 
* 1 g citric acid dissolved in 200 ml water 
If you cannot take either of these test meals, please tell your doctor, who will suggest an alternative. A 
drinking vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13C-urea powder. If the test needs to be 
repeated, this should be done on the following day at the earliest. </p>
<p>Special instructions for use (for mass spectrometry) 
The test is to be performed after instruction by a healthcare professional and under appropriate 
medical supervision. The patient data should be documented using the provided data sheet. It is 
recommended that you take the test in a resting position. </p>
<ol>
<li>The test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application, preferably 
overnight. If the test needs to be carried out later in the day, only a light meal like tea and toast 
is recommended. </li>
<li>The test begins with the collection of samples for determining the baseline values: </li>
<li>The straw and sample tubes labelled  sampling time: 00-minute-value  are taken from the 
test set. </li>
<li>The stopper is removed from one of the sample containers and place the unwrapped straw 
into the container. </li>
<li>Now the patient breathes gently through the straw into the sample tube until the inside of 
the sample tube steams up. </li>
<li>The patient must continue to breathe through the straw while removing it from the sample 
tube, and then immediately seal the tube with its stopper. 
If the sample tube remains open for more than 30 seconds, the result could be inaccurate. </li>
<li>The sample container should be held upright and the bar-code label marked  00-minute-
value  will be stuck round the sample container so that the lines of the bar code are 
horizontal. </li>
<li>Now the second sample container (labelled  sampling time: 00-minute-value ) has to be filled 
up with breath in the same way as described above. </li>
<li>Then the patient must drink the recommended test meal (200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric 
acid in 200 ml water). </li>
<li>Now the preparation of the test solution follows. </li>
<li>The jar labelled  13C-urea powder  is removed from the test set, opened, and filled up to 
about three quarters with tap water. </li>
<li>The jar is closed and carefully shaken until all the powder has dissolved completely. </li>
<li>The contents are poured into a drinking glass, the jar filled a second and third time with 
water and the contents transferred into the drinking glass, so that approximately 30 ml of 
test solution is obtained. </li>
<li>The patient should drink this test solution immediately. The time of intake must be noted. </li>
<li>
<p>30 minutes after the test solution has been taken (point 6), the  30-minute-value  samples are 
collected in both containers, which remain in the pack (labelled  sampling time: 30-minute-
value ) as described under points 2 and 3. The bar-code labels marked  30-minute-value  must be used for these samples. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation. All 
breath sample containers should be placed back into the original packaging. This packaging 
should be sealed with the remaining sticker. </p>
</li>
<li>The package must be sent to a qualified laboratory for analysis. </li>
</ol>
<p>Medical or healthcare professionals can find detailed information on the analysis of breath samples and 
the testing specifications for laboratories, in section 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. </p>
<p>If you take more Helicobacter Test INFAI than you should 
Because only 75 mg 13C-urea is provided overdose is not to be expected. </p>
