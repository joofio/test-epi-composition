<p>Hemlibra contains the active substance “emicizumab”. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
“monoclonal antibodies”. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein that recognise and bind to a 
target in the body. </p>
<p>What Hemlibra is used for </p>
<p>Hemlibra is a medicine used for treating patients of all ages with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency): 
● 
who have developed factor VIII inhibitors<br />
● 
who have not developed factor VIII inhibitors with: 
- severe disease (the factor VIII blood level is less than 1%)<br />
- moderate disease (the factor VIII blood level is from 1% to 5%) with severe bleeding 
phenotype. </p>
<p>Haemophilia A is an inherited condition caused by a lack of factor VIII, an essential substance 
required for blood to clot and stop any bleeding. </p>
<p>The medicine prevents bleeding or reduces bleeding episodes in people with this condition. </p>
<p>Some patients with haemophilia A can develop factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies against factor VIII) 
which stop the replacement factor VIII from working. </p>
<p>How Hemlibra works </p>
<p>Hemlibra restores the function of missing activated factor VIII that is needed for effective blood 
clotting. Its structure is different from factor VIII, therefore Hemlibra is not affected by factor VIII 
inhibitors.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>● 
if you are allergic to emicizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Hemlibra. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Before you start using Hemlibra, it is very important to talk to your doctor about using 
“bypassing agents” (medicines that help blood clot but which work in a different way from 
factor VIII). This is because treatment with bypassing agents may need to change while receiving 
Hemlibra. Examples of bypassing agents include activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) 
and recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa). Serious and potentially life-threatening side effects can occur when 
aPCC is used in patients who are also receiving Hemlibra:  </p>
<p>Potentially serious side effects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra  </p>
<p>● 
Destruction of red blood cells (thrombotic microangiopathy) 
- This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.<br />
- When people have this condition, the lining of the blood vessels can be damaged and 
blood clots may develop in small blood vessels. In some cases, this can cause damage to the 
kidneys and other organs.<br />
- Be cautious if you are at high risk for this condition (have had this condition in the 
past, or a member of your family have suffered from it), or if you are taking medicines that 
can increase the risk of developing this condition, such as ciclosporin, quinine or tacrolimus. 
- It is important to know the symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy, in case you 
develop the condition (see section 4, “Possible side effects” for a list of symptoms).  </p>
<p>Stop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices 
any symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy. </p>
<p>● 
Blood clots (thromboembolism) 
- In rare cases, a blood clot can form inside blood vessels and block them, which may 
be life-threatening.<br />
- It is important to know the symptoms of such internal blood clots, in case they 
develop (see section 4, “Possible side effects” for a list of symptoms). </p>
<p>Stop using Hemlibra and aPCC, and talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices 
any symptoms of blood clots in blood vessels.     </p>
<p>Other important information about Hemlibra  </p>
<p>● 
Antibody formation (immunogenicity) </p>
<ul>
<li>You may notice that bleeding is not being controlled with your prescribed dose of this 
medicine. This could be due to the development of antibodies to this medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to a doctor immediately if you or your caregiver notices an increase in bleeds. Your doctor may 
decide to change your treatment if this medicine stops working for you.  </p>
<p>Children below the age of 1 year </p>
<p>In children less than one year of age, the blood system is still developing. If your child is less than one 
year old, your doctor may prescribe Hemlibra only after carefully weighing the expected benefits and 
risks of using this product.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Hemlibra </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>● 
Using a bypassing agent while receiving Hemlibra 
- Before you start using Hemlibra, talk to your doctor and carefully follow their 
instructions on when to use a bypassing agent and the dose and schedule you should use. 
Hemlibra increases the ability of your blood to clot. Therefore, the dose of bypassing agent 
required may be lower than the dose you used before starting Hemlibra.<br />
- Use aPCC only if no other treatment can be used. If aPCC is required, talk to your 
doctor in case you feel you need a total of more than 50 units/kg of aPCC. For more 
information on using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra, see in section 2: “Potentially serious 
side effects of using aPCC while receiving Hemlibra”.<br />
- Despite limited experience with concomitant administration of anti-fibrinolytics with 
aPCC or rFVIIa in patients treated with Hemlibra, you should know that there may be a 
possibility of thrombotic events using anti-fibrinolytics administered intravenously in 
combination with aPCC or rFVIIa. </p>
<p>Laboratory tests </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using Hemlibra before you have laboratory tests to measure how well your 
blood is clotting. This is because Hemlibra in the blood may interfere with some laboratory tests, 
leading to inaccurate results. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>● 
You should use an effective method of birth control (contraception) during treatment with 
Hemlibra and for 6 months after your last injection of Hemlibra. 
● 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will 
consider the benefit of you taking Hemlibra against the risk to your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>This medicine is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Hemlibra is provided in single-use vials as ready to use solution which does not need to be diluted. 
A doctor qualified to care for patients with haemophilia will start you on treatment with Hemlibra. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your healthcare provider if 
you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Keeping a record </p>
<p>Each time you use Hemlibra, record the name and batch number of the medicine. </p>
<p>How much Hemlibra to use </p>
<p>The dose of Hemlibra depends on your weight and your doctor will calculate the amount (in mg) and 
corresponding amount of Hemlibra solution (in mL) to be injected: </p>
<p>● 
Loading dose regimen: Weeks 1 to 4: The dose is 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you 
weigh, injected once a week. </p>
<p>● 
Maintenance dose regimen: Week 5 and onwards: The dose is either 1.5 milligrams for every 
1 kilogram you weigh, injected once a week, 3 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, 
injected every 2 weeks, or 6 milligrams for every 1 kilogram you weigh, injected every 
4 weeks.  </p>
<p>The decision, to use either the 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, 3 mg/kg every two weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 
four weeks maintenance dose, should be made in consultation with your doctor and, where applicable, 
with your caregiver. </p>
<p>Different Hemlibra concentrations (30 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) should not be combined in a single 
injection when making up the total volume to be injected. </p>
<p>The amount of Hemlibra solution given in each injection must not be more than 2 mL.  </p>
<p>How Hemlibra is given </p>
<p>If you inject Hemlibra yourself or if your caregiver injects it, you or your caregiver must 
carefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, “Instructions for use”. </p>
<p>● 
Hemlibra is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). 
● 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject Hemlibra. 
● 
Once you have been trained, you should be able to inject this medicine at home, by yourself or 
with the help of a caregiver.<br />
● 
To correctly insert the needle under the skin, pinch a fold of loose skin at the clean injection 
site with your free hand. Pinching the skin is important to ensure that you inject under the skin 
(into fatty tissue) but not any deeper (into muscle). Injecting into a muscle could cause 
discomfort. 
● 
Prepare and give the injection in clean and germ-free conditions using aseptic technique. Your 
doctor or nurse will give more information about this. </p>
<p>Where to inject Hemlibra  </p>
<p>● 
Your doctor will show you which areas of the body are suitable for injecting Hemlibra.<br />
● 
The recommended places to give an injection are: the front of the waist (lower abdomen), 
upper outer arms, or the front of the thighs. Use only recommended places for injection.<br />
● 
For each injection, use a different area of the body to the one you used last time.<br />
● 
Do not give injections where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard, or areas where there are 
moles or scars. 
● 
When using Hemlibra, any other medicine injected under the skin should be given in a 
different area. </p>
<p>Using syringes and needles </p>
<p>● 
A syringe, a transfer needle with 5 micrometre filter, and an injection needle are used to draw 
up the Hemlibra solution from the vial into the syringe and to inject it under the skin.<br />
● 
Syringes, transfer needles with filter and injection needles are not provided in this pack. For 
more information, see in section 6 “What is needed for Hemlibra administration and is not 
contained in this pack”.<br />
● 
Make sure that you use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it after a 
single use. 
● 
A 1 mL syringe should be used for an injection up to 1 mL of Hemlibra solution. 
● 
A 2 to 3 mL syringe should be used for an injection greater than 1 mL and up to 2 mL of 
Hemlibra solution. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents </p>
<p>Hemlibra can be used in adolescents and children of all ages.<br />
● 
A child can self-inject the medicine provided the child’s healthcare provider and the parent or 
caregiver agree. Self-injection for children below the age of 7 years is not recommended.  </p>
<p>If you use more Hemlibra than you should </p>
<p>If you use more Hemlibra than you are supposed to, tell your doctor immediately. This is because you 
may be at risk of developing side effects such as blood clots. Always use Hemlibra exactly as your 
doctor has told you, and check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Hemlibra </p>
<p>● 
If you forget your scheduled injection, inject the forgotten dose as soon as possible before the 
day of the next scheduled dose. Then, continue to inject the medicine as scheduled. Do not 
inject two doses on the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. 
● 
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>If you stop using Hemlibra </p>
<p>Do not stop using Hemlibra without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Hemlibra, you may no 
longer be protected against bleeding. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
