Hepcludex contains the active substance bulevirtide, which is an antiviral medicine. </p>
<p>What Hepcludex is used for 
Hepcludex is used to treat long-term (chronic) hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in adults with 
compensated liver disease (when the liver is still working well enough). Infection with hepatitis delta 
virus causes inflammation of the liver. </p>
<p>How Hepcludex works 
HDV uses a particular protein in liver cells to enter the cells. Bulevirtide, the active substance in this 
medicine blocks the protein and so prevents the HDV from getting into liver cells. This reduces the 
spread of HDV in the liver and reduces inflammation.  </p>         </div>"""

<li>Step-by-step injection guide  </li>
</ol>
<p>Before using Hepcludex, you must first read sections 1   6 of this package leaflet. </p>
<p>Before you begin treatment with this medicine at home, your doctor or nurse will show you how to 
prepare and inject Hepcludex. This guide shows how to inject the medicine yourself. Speak with your 
doctor or nurse if you are unclear about anything or you have questions or need more information or 
help. Take your time to carefully prepare and inject Hepcludex.  </p>
<p>Injection sites 
Abdomen 
Upper thighs 
In order to reduce injection site reactions, you may 
change the site of bulevirtide injection regularly. 
Do not inject bulevirtide into the following areas: 
knee, groin, the lower or inner buttocks, directly 
over a blood vessel, around the navel (belly 
button), on scar tissue, a bruise, a mole, a surgical 
scar, tattoo or burn site, or where there is an 
injection site reaction. </p>

Storage 
Preparing doses 
Wash hands 
Clean vial 
Bulevirtide vials must 
be stored in the original 
packaging in the 
refrigerator (2 8 C) in 
order to protect 
bulevirtide from light. </p>
<p>The following 
instructions are for 
dissolving a single 
dose. </p>
<p>Wash your hands well 
using soap and warm 
water and dry them 
with a clean towel. 
Once your hands are 
clean, do not touch 
anything else other 
than the medicine, 
supplies and the area 
around the injection 
site. </p>
<p>Wipe the vial top with 
a new alcohol pad and 
let the top air-dry. 
If you touch the rubber 
top after cleaning it, 
clean it again with a 
new alcohol pad. </p>

Draw up sterile water 
Inject sterile 
water into the 
powder 
Gently mix bulevirtide 
Pick up the syringe. Put the longer needle on.  </p>
<p>Important! Be sure the capped needle is tight 
by pushing it down slightly while twisting it 
clockwise. </p>
<p>Pull off the plastic cap. </p>
<p>Open the sterile water for injection. Insert the 
needle in the vial and gently turn the water 
vial upside down. Make sure the tip of the 
needle is always below the surface of the 
water to help keep air bubbles from entering 
the syringe. </p>
<p>Slowly pull the plunger back to get 1.0 ml of 
sterile water into the syringe. Carefully 
remove the needle and syringe from the vial. 
Gently tap the 
bulevirtide vial to 
loosen the powder. 
Insert the needle 
with sterile water 
into the bulevirtide 
vial at an angle. 
Inject the sterile 
water slowly, so it 
can drip down the 
side of the vial into 
the bulevirtide 
powder. </p>
<p>Gently tap the bulevirtide vial 
with your fingertip for 10 sec to 
start dissolving the powder. 
Then gently roll the bulevirtide 
vial between your hands to 
ensure thorough mixing. Make 
sure no bulevirtide powder is 
stuck to the vial wall. 
Important! Do not shake the 
bulevirtide vial. Shaking will 
make the medicine foam and it 
will take much longer to 
dissolve. </p>

Inspect bulevirtide 
Bulevirtide ready for injection 
Clean vial 
Once the powder starts 
to dissolve, just set it 
aside and it completely 
will dissolve. 
After tapping, it could 
take up to 3 min to 
dissolve.  </p>
<p>When mixed completely, the bulevirtide solution 
should be clear. 
Important! Completely dissolved bulevirtide 
should be clear and without foam. 
If the bulevirtide solution appears foamy or 
yellowish, allow more time for it to dissolve. </p>
<p>If you see bubbles, gently tap the vial until they 
disappear. 
If you see any particles in the bulevirtide solution 
once it is (completely) dissolved, do not use that 
vial. Contact your doctor or pharmacist that 
provided it. </p>
<p>Reconstituted bulevirtide must be used 
immediately. </p>
<p>Clean the bulevirtide 
vial top again, using a 
new alcohol pad. </p>

the plunger to remove 
extra air and bubbles. 
To be sure you end 
up with 1.0 ml of 
bulevirtide in the 
syringe, you may need<br />
to pull the plunger past 
the 1.0 ml mark. 
Carefully remove the 
needle and syringe
