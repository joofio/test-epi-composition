Hepcludex contains the active substance bulevirtide, which is an antiviral medicine. </p>
<p>What Hepcludex is used for 
Hepcludex is used to treat long-term (chronic) hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in adults with 
compensated liver disease (when the liver is still working well enough). Infection with hepatitis delta 
virus causes inflammation of the liver. </p>
<p>How Hepcludex works 
HDV uses a particular protein in liver cells to enter the cells. Bulevirtide, the active substance in this 
medicine blocks the protein and so prevents the HDV from getting into liver cells. This reduces the 
spread of HDV in the liver and reduces inflammation.  </p>         </div>"""
