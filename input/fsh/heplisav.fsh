the hepatitis B virus. </p>
<p>HEPLISAV B may also protect against hepatitis D which can only occur in people who have hepatitis 
B infection. </p>
<p>What is hepatitis B? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hepatitis B is an infectious illness of the liver, caused by a virus. Hepatitis B virus infection can 
cause serious liver problems such as  cirrhosis  (scarring in the liver) or liver cancer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people infected with the hepatitis B virus become carriers, which means that they may not 
feel ill but continue to have the virus in their body and they can still infect other people. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disease spreads by the hepatitis B virus entering the body through contact with an infected 
person s body fluids, such as in the vagina, blood, semen, or spit (saliva). A mother who is a 
carrier of the virus can also pass the virus to her baby at birth. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main signs of the illness include mild signs of flu (such as headache, fever, and feeling very 
tired), dark urine, pale stools (faeces), yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). However, 
some people with hepatitis B do not look or feel ill. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How HEPLISAV B works </p>
<p>When a person is given the HEPLISAV B vaccine, it helps the body s natural defence system 
(immune system) produce specific protection (antibodies) against the hepatitis B virus.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HEPLISAV B contains an adjuvant, a substance which improves the body s production of 
antibodies and makes the protection last for longer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A course of two injections of HEPLISAV B is required to provide full protection against 
hepatitis B. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HEPLISAV B is not used to treat a person who is already infected with the hepatitis B virus, 
including people infected with the hepatitis B virus and have become carriers for infection.  </p>

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to any of the components of this vaccine, including yeast (listed in section 6). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin, rash, shortness of breath and swelling of 
the face or tongue. </li>
<li>If you have had a sudden life-threatening, allergic reaction after receiving HEPLISAV B in the 
past. </li>
</ul>
<p>HEPLISAV B should not be given if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor, <em>pharmacist</em> or nurse before vaccination with HEPLISAV B. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, <em>pharmacist</em> or nurse before receiving HEPLISAV B:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have any allergies to any of the components of HEPLISAV B (see section 6). </li>
<li>If you have had any health problems after having a vaccine in the past. </li>
<li>Fainting can occur after, or even before, any injection. Therefore tell the doctor, <em>pharmacist</em> 
or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. </li>
<li>If you are ill with a high fever, your doctor, <em>pharmacist</em> or nurse will delay the vaccination 
until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but your 
doctor, <em>pharmacist</em> or nurse will decide if you could still be vaccinated. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are on dialysis for a kidney problem or if you have a weakened immune system your doctor 
may need to do a blood test to check if the vaccination has worked well enough to protect you against 
hepatitis B. </p>
<p>HEPLISAV B does not protect you against other liver infections such as hepatitis A, C, and E. </p>
<p>As with any vaccine, HEPLISAV B may not protect all people who are vaccinated. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor, <em>pharmacist</em> or nurse before 
receiving HEPLISAV B. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Since HEPLISAV B has not been tested fully in young people under 18 years of age, it should not be 
used in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and HEPLISAV B 
Tell your doctor, <em>pharmacist</em> or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines or vaccines. </p>
<p>If HEPLISAV B is given at the same time as an injection of hepatitis B  immuno-globulins , which 
would be given to provide immediate, short-term protection against hepatitis B infection, your doctor, 
<em>pharmacist</em> or nurse will make sure that the two are injected into different parts of the body. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before receiving this vaccine.  </p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of HEPLISAV B during pregnancy. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether HEPLISAV B is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded. Discuss with your doctor or nurse if you should discontinue breast-feeding or abstain from 
HEPLISAV B vaccination, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for your child and the 
benefit of vaccination for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may feel tired or get a headache after receiving HEPLISAV B. If this happens, do not drive or use 
any tools or machines.  </p>
<p>HEPLISAV B contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free . </p>         </div>"""
