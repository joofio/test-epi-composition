  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>HETLIOZ contains the active substance tasimelteon.  This type of medicine is called a “melatonin agonist” 
that acts as a regulator of daily body rhythms. </p>
<p>It is used to treat Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) in adults who are totally blind. </p>
<p>How HETLIOZ works 
In sighted people, the change in light levels between day and night helps to synchronise internal body 
rhythms, including feeling sleepy at night and being active during the day. The body controls these rhythms 
through many pathways including increases and decreases in the production of the hormone melatonin.  </p>
<p>Patients with Non-24 who are totally blind cannot see light, so their body rhythms shift out of alignment with 
the 24-hour world, resulting in periods of feeling sleepy during the day and the inability to sleep at night. The 
active substance in HETLIOZ, tasimelteon, is able to act as a time-keeper for the body rhythms and resets 
them each day.  It aligns body rhythms with the usual 24-hour day and night cycle and so improve sleep 
patterns. Because of individual differences in each person’s body rhythms, it could take weeks or up to 3 
months for an improvement in symptoms to be noticed.  </p>         </div>"""

You are allergic to tasimelteon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
After taking HETLIOZ, you should get ready to go to bed and only carry out activities that you would 
normally do before going to bed. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give HETLIOZ to children under the age of 18 years.  This is because HETLIOZ has not been tested 
in people under 18 years of age and the effects are unknown.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and HETLIOZ 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  This 
includes:<br />
- medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP1A2’.  An example is 
fluvoxamine, which is used to treat depression and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). <br />
- medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP3A4’.  An example is 
ketoconazole, which is used to treat fungal infections. 
- medicines known to increase the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP3A4’.  An example is rifampicin, 
which is used to treat tuberculosis (TB). 
- medicines known to reduce the activity of an enzyme called ‘CYP2C19’.  An example is 
omeprazole, which is used to treat hearburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
- medicines called “beta blockers” used to treat high blood pressure and other heart problems.  Some 
examples include atenolol, metoprolol, and propanolol. </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
HETLIOZ. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to 
avoid the use of tasimelteon during pregnancy.  If you become pregnant while taking HETLIOZ, consult 
your doctor immediately as it is recommended not to take HETLIOZ while you are pregnant or breast 
feeding. </p>
<p>HETLIOZ contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before 
taking this medicine. </p>
<p>HETLIOZ contains Orange Yellow S (E110) 
Tell your doctor if you have an allergy to Orange Yellow S (E110).  HETLIOZ contains Orange Yellow S 
(E110) which may cause allergic reactions. </p>
<p>HETLIOZ contains sodium<br />
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How much to take 
The recommended dose is one capsule every night, taken one hour before you go to bed. Try to take the 
medicine at the same time every night.  Because of individual differences in each person’s body rhythms, it 
could take weeks or months for you to notice an improvement in your symptoms.  Therefore, your doctor 
may ask you to take HETLIOZ for up to 3 months before checking if it is working for you. </p>
<p>Taking HETLIOZ 
- Take the medicine by mouth. 
- Swallow the capsule whole.<br />
- It is best to take HETLIOZ on an empty stomach as food can reduce the amount of the medicine that 
is absorbed into your body.  If you eat a high-fat meal close to the time you would normally take the 
medicine, it is best to wait 2 hours before taking HETLIOZ.<br />
- To open the bottle, push the cap down and turn counter-clockwise. </p>
<p>If you take more HETLIOZ than you should 
If you accidentally take more HETLIOZ than your doctor recommended, contact your doctor at once or 
contact the nearest hospital for advice. Keep the bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you 
have taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take HETLIOZ 
- Skip the missed dose.  Take your next dose at the usual time the next day. Do not take a double dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking HETLIOZ 
Do not stop taking HETLIOZ without talking to your doctor. 
- If HETLIOZ is not taken every night, the body rhythms will lose alignment with the usual 24-hour 
day and night cycle again.  This means that  symptoms will come back. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
