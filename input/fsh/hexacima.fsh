  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Hexacima (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) is a vaccine used to protect against infectious diseases. </p>
<p>Hexacima helps to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and serious 
diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Hexacima is given to children from six weeks of 
age. </p>
<p>The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria 
and viruses that cause these different infections: 
* Diphtheria is an infectious disease that usually first affects the throat. In the throat, the infection 
causes pain and swelling that can lead to suffocation. The bacterium that causes the disease also 
makes a toxin (poison) that can damage the heart, kidneys, and nerves. 
* Tetanus (often called lock jaw) is usually caused by the tetanus bacterium entering a deep 
wound. The bacterium makes a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles leading to 
inability to breathe and the possibility of suffocation. 
* Pertussis (often called whooping cough) is a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It 
causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a 
 whooping  sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can 
also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) that may last a long time, lung infections 
(pneumonia), fits, brain damage, and even death. 
* Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). 
In some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time and can eventually lead to serious 
liver problems, including liver cancer. 
* Poliomyelitis (often just called polio) is caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to 
paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control 
breathing and swallowing can be fatal. 
* Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib) are serious bacterial infections 
and can cause meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead to 
brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation 
and swelling of the throat leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing. The infection can 
affect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints. 
Important information about the protection provided </p>
<ul>
<li>Hexacima will only help to prevent these diseases if they are caused by the bacteria or viruses 
targeted by the vaccine. Your child could get diseases with similar symptoms if they are caused 
by other bacteria or viruses. </li>
<li>The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the 
infectious diseases against which it protects. </li>
<li>This vaccine does not protect against infections caused by other types of Haemophilus 
influenzae nor against meningitis due to other micro-organisms. </li>
<li>Hexacima will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, 
hepatitis C, and hepatitis E. </li>
<li>Because symptoms of hepatitis B take a long time to develop, it is possible for unrecognised 
hepatitis B infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent 
hepatitis B infection in such cases. </li>
<li>As with any vaccine, Hexacima may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine.  </li>
</ul>         </div>"""

any of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse to explain. </p>
<p>Do not use Hexacima if your child: </p>
<ul>
<li>has had respiratory disorder or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration 
of Hexacima. </li>
<li>has had an allergic reaction </li>
<li>to the active substances, </li>
<li>to any of the excipients listed in section 6, </li>
<li>to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, as these 
substances are used during the manufacturing process. </li>
<li>after previous administration of Hexacima or any other diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, or Hib containing vaccines. </li>
<li>suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior 
dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis). </li>
<li>has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system 
(uncontrolled neurologic disorder), or uncontrolled epilepsy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child: 
* has a moderate or high temperature or an acute illness (e.g. fever, sore throat, cough, cold, or 
flu). Vaccination with Hexacima may need to be delayed until your child is better. 
* has had any of the following events after receiving a pertussis vaccine, as the decision to give 
further doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be carefully considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>fever of 40 C or above within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable 
cause. </li>
<li>collapse or shock-like state with hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (drop in energy) 
within 48 hours of vaccination. </li>
<li>persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, occurring within 48 hours of 
vaccination. </li>
<li>fits (convulsions) with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. </li>
<li>previously had Guillain-Barr  syndrome (temporary inflammation of nerves causing pain, 
paralysis, and sensitivity disorders) or brachial neuritis (severe pain and decreased mobility of 
arm and shoulder) after being given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of 
tetanus toxin). In this case, the decision to give any further vaccine containing tetanus toxoid 
should be evaluated by your doctor. </li>
<li>is having a treatment that suppresses her/his immune system (the body s natural defenses) or 
has any disease that causes the weakness of the immune system. In these cases the immune 
response to the vaccine may be decreased. It is normally recommended to wait until the end of 
the treatment or disease before vaccinating. However children with long standing problems with 
their immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Hexacima, but the 
protection may not be as good as in children whose immune system is healthy. </li>
<li>suffers from an acute or chronic illness including chronic renal insufficiency or failure (inability 
of the kidneys to work properly). </li>
<li>suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy that is not controlled. Your doctor 
will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination. </li>
<li>has any problems with the blood that cause easy bruising or bleeding for a long time after minor 
cuts. Your doctor will advise you whether your child should have Hexacima. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore, tell your doctor or nurse 
your child fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>Other medicines or vaccines and Hexacima </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any other medicines 
or vaccines. 
Hexacima can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles, 
mumps, rubella vaccines, varicella vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, or meningococcal vaccines.<br />
When given at the same time with other vaccines, Hexacima will be given at different injection sites. </p>
<p>Hexacima contains phenylalanine, potassium and sodium  </p>
<p>Hexacima contains 85 micrograms phenylalanine in each 0.5-mL dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful 
if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because 
the body cannot remove it properly. 
Hexacima contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 
dose, that is to say essentially  potassium-free  and  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

Hexacima is given as an injection into a muscle (intramuscular route IM) in the upper part of your 
child s leg or upper arm. The vaccine will never be given into a blood vessel or into or under the skin. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is as follows: </p>
<p>First course of vaccination (primary vaccination) 
Your child will receive either two injections given at an interval of two months, or three injections 
given at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). This vaccine should be used 
according to the local vaccination programme. </p>
<p>Additional injections (booster) 
After the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local 
recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you 
when this dose should be given. </p>
<p>If your child misses a dose of Hexacima </p>
<p>If your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse 
who will decide when to give the missed dose. 
It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that your child completes the 
course of injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases. </p>
