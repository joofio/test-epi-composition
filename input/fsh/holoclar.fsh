  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Holoclar is a medicine used for replacing damaged cells of the cornea (the clear layer that covers the 
coloured iris at the front of the eye) including limbal cells which normally help to maintain the health 
of your eye. </p>
<p>Holoclar consists of a layer of your own cells which have been grown (ex vivo expanded) from a 
sample of limbal cells taken from your eye during a small surgical procedure called a biopsy. Each 
preparation of Holoclar is made individually and is for a single treatment only, although treatments can 
be repeated. The cells used to make Holoclar are known as autologous limbal cells: </p>
<ul>
<li>Autologous means that they are your own cells. </li>
<li>The limbus is part of the eye. It is the rim surrounding the coloured centre (iris) of your 
eye. The picture shows where the limbus is in your eye. </li>
<li>The limbus contains limbal cells which normally help to maintain the health of your 
eye and some of these are stem cells which can make new cells. These new cells can 
replace the damaged cells in your eye. </li>
</ul>
<p>Holoclar is implanted to repair the damaged surface of the eye in adults. When the eye is badly 
damaged by physical or chemical burns, lots of scarring can occur and the limbus can be damaged. 
Damage to the limbus stops normal healing, which means that the damage to your eye is never 
properly repaired. </p>
<p>By taking some healthy limbal cells, a new layer of healthy tissue is grown in the laboratory on a 
supporting layer of fibrin, a protein scaffold. This layer of tissue is then implanted by a surgeon into the 
damaged cornea helping your eye to heal normally. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) or to bovine 
serum and mouse cells </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your surgeon before you are given Holoclar. </p>
<p>Holoclar is prepared individually from your own cells to match you, and must not be used for anyone other 
than yourself. </p>
<p>If you have an acute eye infection or swollen, red (inflamed) eyes, your treatment should be delayed 
until you have recovered. </p>
<p>When Holoclar is made, two ingredients from animals are used. One is foetal bovine serum which is 
from cows and is used to help grow your cells. The other ingredient is a special kind of inactivated 
mouse cell which is used to grow your limbal cells. If you are allergic to either of these ingredients, 
you will not be able to be given this medicine (see above under  You must not be given Holoclar ).  </p>
<p>If you have any of the following problems with your eyes, they should be treated before this medicine 
is used: 
  Uneven eyelids 
  Scarring of the conjunctiva (the protective layer over the white of your eye) with damage 
where it joins to the inside of the eyelids (fornix shortening) 
  Inability for your eye to sense pain (anaesthesia of the cornea or conjunctiva or hypoaesthia) 
  Growth of the conjunctiva over the cornea (pterygium) 
  Severe dry eye. </p>
<p>Other cases in which Holoclar cannot be used 
Even if the surgeon has already taken a small sample of limbal cells (a biopsy) needed to produce the 
medicine, it is possible that you will not be able to have treatment with Holoclar. This is the case if the 
biopsy is not good enough to make Holoclar, the cells cannot be grown in the laboratory or the grown 
cells do not meet all the quality requirements. Your surgeon will inform you about this. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Only a very small number of children have been treated so far, so it is not known whether the 
medicine is safe for use in children or how effective it may be. </p>
<p>Kidney and liver problems 
Please talk with your surgeon before the start of treatment if you have liver or kidney disease. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Holoclar </p>
<p>Some eye-drops contain a preservative called  benzalkonium chloride . This ingredient can damage 
the cells of which Holoclar is made. Do not use eye-drops containing benzalkonium chloride and/or 
other preservatives. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or you are breast-feeding, treatment with this 
medicine should be delayed.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Holoclar is given by surgery on your eye and this will impact on your ability to drive and use 
machines. Therefore, do not drive or use machines after having Holoclar put in your eye until your 
surgeon tells you that it is safe to do so. Follow their advice carefully. </p>         </div>"""

Treatment with Holoclar is a two-step procedure. </p>
<p>Visit 1: Biopsy taken 
On the first visit, the surgeon will carry out a biopsy, which means removing a very small amount of 
tissue containing limbal cells (from your eye). Before the biopsy, the surgeon will give you eye-
drops to anaesthetise your eye and surgically take the biopsy. This biopsy will then be used to make 
Holoclar. After biopsy has been taken, your surgeon will prescribe a course of antibiotics for you to 
reduce the chance of an infection.<br />
It will take several weeks to produce Holoclar. </p>
<p>Visit 2: Holoclar implantation 
On the second visit the surgeon will: 
* Anaesthetise your eye<br />
* Remove the scarred surface of the cornea 
* Replace it with Holoclar 
On the day of surgery, the surgeon will anesthetise your eye and then will attach the edge of your new 
cornea with stitches to make sure that Holoclar stays in place. Your eyelid will be taped closed for 
three days and your eye will be bandaged for 10 to 15 days after the implantation. </p>
<p>After surgery, you will be prescribed a course of medicines to ensure full healing: antibiotics to reduce 
the chance of an infection and steroids to reduce swelling and irritation. It is very important that you 
take all the medicines prescribed by your surgeon, otherwise Holoclar may not work. 
Please read the package leaflets for the individual medicines you are given for further information on 
these medicines. </p>
<p>Ask your surgeon if you have any further questions about the treatment with Holoclar. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your surgeon. This includes any possible side effects not listed in

- The active substance consists of 300,000 - 1,200,000 of your living eye cells, on average 
3.5 % of which are stem cells. Each square centimetre of Holoclar contains 79,000 - 316,cells. 
- There are two excipients: one is fibrin - a clear supportive layer used to keep Holoclar intact, the 
other one is a liquid containing amino acids, vitamins, salts and carbohydrates to store the cells in 
the vial called Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with L-glutamine. </p>
<p>What Holoclar looks like and contents of the pack 
Holoclar is a layer of cells for implantation into your eye. The cells are kept alive in a small 
sterile container. The medicine is put in several layers of packaging which protect the medicine </p>
<p>from bacteria and ensures that Holoclar is kept at a stable temperature for 36 hours, if stored at 
room temperature. </p>
<p>Each package contains an individual treatment dose which is large enough to cover your cornea. </p>
