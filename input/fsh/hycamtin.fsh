the results of your last blood test. 
Tell your doctor if any of these applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before you are given this medicine your doctor needs to know: 
* if you have any kidney or liver problems. Your dose of Hycamtin may need to be adjusted. 
* if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. See section  Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
below. 
* if you plan to father a child. See section  Pregnancy and breast-feeding  below. 
Tell your doctor if any of these applies to you. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Hycamtin 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, including 
any herbal products or medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Remember to tell your doctor if you start to take any other medicines while you are on Hycamtin. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Hycamtin is not recommended for pregnant women. It may harm a baby conceived before, during or 
soon after treatment. You should use an effective method of contraception. Ask your doctor for advice. 
Do not try to become pregnant until a doctor advises you it is safe to do so. </p>
<p>Male patients who wish to father a child should ask their doctor for family planning advice or 
treatment. If your partner becomes pregnant during your treatment, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed if you are being treated with Hycamtin. Do not restart breast-feeding until the 
doctor tells you it is safe to do so. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Hycamtin can make people feel tired. If you feel tired or weak, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Hycamtin contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free . If your doctor uses a solution of common salt to dilute Hycamtin, the dose of sodium received 
would be larger. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Serious side effects: tell your doctor 
These very common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Hycamtin: 
* Signs of infections: Hycamtin may reduce the number of white blood cells and lower your 
resistance to infection. This can even be life threatening. Signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>fever </li>
<li>serious deterioration of your general condition </li>
<li>local symptoms such as sore throat or urinary problems (for example, a burning sensation 
when urinating, which may be a urinary infection). </li>
<li>Occasionally severe stomach pain, fever and possibly diarrhoea (rarely with blood) can be signs 
of bowel inflammation (colitis). </li>
</ul>
<p>This rare side effect may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Hycamtin: 
* Lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease): You are most at risk if you have existing lung 
disease, have had radiation treatment to your lungs, or have previously taken medicines that 
caused lung damage. Signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>difficulty breathing </li>
<li>cough </li>
<li>fever. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you get any symptoms of these conditions, as hospitalisation may be 
necessary. </p>
<p>Very common side effects 
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Hycamtin: 
* Feeling generally weak and tired (temporary anaemia). In some cases you may need a blood 
transfusion. 
* Unusual bruising or bleeding, caused by a decrease in the number of clotting cells in the blood. 
This can lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. Rarely, it can 
lead to more severe bleeding (haemorrhage). Talk to your doctor for advice on how to minimise 
the risk of bleeding. 
* Weight loss and loss of appetite (anorexia); tiredness; weakness. 
* Feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting); diarrhoea; stomach pain; constipation. 
* Inflammation and ulcers of the mouth tongue or gums. 
* High body temperature (fever). 
* Hair loss. </p>
<p>Common side effects 
These may affect up to 1 in 10 people treated with Hycamtin: 
* Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (including rash). 
* Yellow skin. 
* Feeling unwell. 
* Itching sensation. </p>
<p>Rare side effects 
These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Hycamtin: 
* Severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions. 
* Swelling caused by fluid build-up (angioedema). 
* Mild pain and inflammation at the site of injection. 
* Itchy rash (or hives). </p>
<p>Side effects with frequency not known 
The frequency of some side effects is not known (events from spontaneous reports and the frequency 
cannot be estimated from the available data): 
* Severe stomach pain, nausea, vomiting of blood, black or bloody stools (possible symptoms of 
gastrointestinal perforation). 
* Mouth sores, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloody stools 
(possible signs and symptoms of inflammation of the inner lining of the mouth, stomach and/or 
gut [mucosal inflammation]). </p>
<p>If you are being treated for cervical cancer, you may get side effects from the other medicine 
(cisplatin) that you will be given along with Hycamtin. Those effects are described in the cisplatin 
patient leaflet. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
