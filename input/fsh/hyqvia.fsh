<p>HyQvia contains two solutions for infusion (drip) under the skin (subcutaneous or SC infusion). 
It is supplied as a package containing one vial of human normal immunoglobulin 10% (the active 
substance) and one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase (a substance which helps the human 
normal immunoglobulin 10% reach your blood). </p>
<p>Human normal immunoglobulin 10% belongs to a class of medicines called  human normal 
immunoglobulins . Immunoglobulins are also known as antibodies and are found in healthy people s 
blood. Antibodies are part of the immune system (the body s natural defences) and help your body to 
fight infections. </p>
<p>How HyQvia works </p>
<p>The vial of immunoglobulins has been prepared from the blood of healthy people. The medicine works 
in exactly the same way as the immunoglobulins naturally present in the blood. The recombinant 
human hyaluronidase is a protein that makes it easier for the immunoglobulins to be infused (dripped) 
under the skin and to reach your blood system. </p>
<p>What HyQvia is used for </p>
<p>HyQvia is used in patients with a weak immune system, who do not have enough antibodies in their 
blood and tend to get frequent infections. Regular and sufficient doses of HyQvia can raise abnormally 
low immunoglobulin levels in your blood to normal levels (replacement therapy). </p>
<p>HyQvia is prescribed as replacement therapy to patients who do not have sufficient antibodies, 
including the following groups: </p>
<p>patients with an inborn inability or reduced ability to produce antibodies (primary 
immunodeficiencies).  </p>
<p>patients who experience severe or recurrent infections due to a weakened immune system 
resulting from other conditions or treatments </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to immunoglobulins, hyaluronidase, recombinant hyaluronidase or any 
of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6,  Contents of the pack and other 
information ). </li>
<li>if you have antibodies against immunoglobulin A (IgA) in your blood. This may occur if you 
have IgA deficiency. Since HyQvia contains trace amounts of IgA, you might have an allergic 
reaction. </li>
<li>into a blood vessel (intravenously). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>The following warnings and precautions should be taken into consideration before you receive or 
use HyQvia. If you have any questions, talk to your doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>The data on the effects of long-term use of recombinant human hyaluronidase on pregnancy, 
breast-feeding and fertility are limited. HyQvia should only be used by pregnant and breast-feeding 
women after discussion with your physician. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions </p>
<p>You may be allergic to immunoglobulins without knowing it. Allergic reactions such as sudden fall 
in blood pressure or anaphylactic shock (a sharp fall in blood pressure with other symptoms such as 
swelling of the throat, breathing difficulties and skin rash) are rare but they can occasionally occur 
even if you have not previously had problems with similar treatments. You are at increased risk of 
allergic reactions if you have IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies. Signs or symptoms of these rare 
allergic reactions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeling light-headed, dizzy or faint, </li>
<li>skin rash and itchiness, swelling in the mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing, </li>
<li>abnormal heart rate, chest pain, blueness of lips or fingers and toes, </li>
<li>blurred vision. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will first infuse HyQvia slowly, and carefully monitor you throughout the first 
infusions so that any allergic reaction can be detected and treated immediately. </p>
<p>If you notice any of these signs during the infusion, tell your doctor or nurse immediately. 
He or she will decide whether to slow down the infusion rate or stop the infusion 
completely. </p>
<p>Infusion speed </p>
<p>It is very important to infuse the medicine at the correct speed. Your doctor or nurse will advise 
you on the appropriate infusion speed to use when you are infusing HyQvia at home (see section 3, 
 How to use HyQvia ). </p>
<p>Monitoring during infusion </p>
<p>Certain side effects may occur more frequently if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are receiving HyQvia for the first time. </li>
<li>you have received another immunoglobulin and have been switched to HyQvia. </li>
<li>there has been a long interval (e.g., more than 2 or 3 infusion intervals) since you last received 
HyQvia. </li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, you will be closely monitored during your first infusion and for the first 
hour after your infusion has stopped. </p>
<p>In all other cases you should be monitored during the infusion and for at least 20 minutes after you 
receive HyQvia for the first few infusions. </p>
<p>Home treatment </p>
<p>Before you start home treatment you should assign a person as guardian. You and your guardian will 
be trained to detect early signs of side effects, especially allergic reactions. This guardian should help 
you keep an eye on potential side effects. During the infusion you must look out for first signs of side 
effects (for further details see section 4,  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>If you experience any side effects, you or your guardian must stop the infusion 
immediately and contact a doctor. </p>
<p>If you experience a severe side effect, you or your guardian must seek emergency 
treatment immediately. </p>
<p>Spread of localised infections </p>
<p>Do not infuse HyQvia into or around an infected or red swollen area on your skin because it may 
cause the infection to spread. </p>
<p>No long-term (chronic) changes in the skin were observed in the clinical studies. Any long-term 
inflammation, lumps (nodules) or inflammation that occur at the infusion site and last more than 
a few days should be reported to your physician. </p>
<p>Effects on blood tests </p>
<p>HyQvia contains many different antibodies, some of which can affect blood tests (serological tests). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor about your treatment with HyQvia before any blood test. </p>
<p>Information on the source material of HyQvia </p>
<p>The human normal immunoglobulin 10% of HyQvia and human serum albumin (an ingredient of the 
recombinant human hyaluronidase) are made from human plasma (the liquid part of blood). When 
medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, and </li>
<li>the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections. </li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can 
inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or 
plasma are used, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to 
any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. </p>
<p>The measures taken for the manufacture of HyQvia are considered effective for enveloped viruses 
such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus and for the 
non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B1</p>         </div>"""

<p>It is strongly recommended that every time you use HyQvia, the following data are recorded in your 
treatment diary:</p>
<ul>
<li>the date of administration, </li>
<li>the batch number of the medicine, and </li>
<li>the injected volume, flow rate, the number and location of infusion sites. </li>

<p>Other medicines and HyQvia </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Vaccinations </p>
<p>HyQvia may reduce the effect of some virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and chicken 
pox (live virus vaccines). Therefore, after receiving HyQvia, you may have to wait for up to 3 months 
before receiving certain vaccines. You may have to wait for up to 1 year after receiving HyQvia before 
you can receive your measles vaccine. </p>
<p>Please tell your vaccinating doctor or nurse about your treatment with HyQvia. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Patients may experience side effects (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment with HyQvia 
that might affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should wait until the 
reactions have disappeared. </p>
<p>HyQvia contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 5.0   60.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
recombinant human hyaluronidase vial of HyQvia. This is equivalent to 0.25   3% of the 
recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. The IG 10% component is 
essentially sodium-free.  </p>         </div>"""

HyQvia at home. Do not begin treatment with HyQvia at home until you have received complete 
instructions. </p>
<p>Dosing </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate the correct dose for you based on your body weight, any previous treatment 
you may have received and your response to treatment. The recommended starting dose is one that 
supplies 400 to 800 mg of active substance per kg of bodyweight per month. In the beginning you will 
receive one quarter of this dose at 1-week intervals. This will be increased step-wise to larger doses 
at 3- to 4-week intervals with the next infusions. Sometimes your doctor may recommend that larger 
doses are split and given at two sites at once. Your doctor may also adjust your dose depending on 
your response to treatment. </p>
<p>Starting treatment </p>
<p>Your treatment will be started by a doctor or nurse experienced in treating patients with a weak 
immune system and in guiding patients for home treatment. You will be watched carefully throughout 
the infusion and for at least 1 hour after stopping the infusion to see how well you tolerate the 
medicine. In the beginning your doctor or nurse will use a slow infusion speed and gradually increase 
it during the first infusion and in the following infusions. Once the doctor or nurse has found the right 
dose and speed of infusion for you, you may be allowed to give the treatment to yourself at home. </p>
<p>Home treatment </p>
<p>You will be instructed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Germ-free (aseptic) infusion techniques, </li>
<li>The use of an infusion pump or syringe driver (if needed), </li>
<li>Keeping a treatment diary, and </li>
<li>Measures to be taken in case of severe side effects. </li>
