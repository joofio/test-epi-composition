(called ‘bone metastases’).<br />

<p>Iasibon can also be prescribed if you have a raised calcium level in your blood due to a tumour. </p>
<p>Iasibon works by reducing the amount of calcium that is lost from your bones. This helps to stop your

listed in section 6 
* if you have, or have ever had low levels of calcium in your blood. </p>
<p>Do not receive this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or

<p>Warnings and precautions 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very 
rarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving ibandronate for cancer-related conditions. ONJ 
can also occur after stopping treatment.  </p>
<p>It is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. 
In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions you 
should take.  </p>
<p>Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if:  </p>
<ul>
<li>you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction  </li>
<li>you don’t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time  </li>
<li>you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems)  </li>
<li>you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders)  </li>
<li>you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone)  </li>
<li>you have cancer.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Iasibon.  </p>
<p>While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and 
receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you 
are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor 
about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Iasibon.  </p>
<p>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Iasibon: 
* if you are allergic  to any other bisphosphonates 
* if you have high or low levels of vitamin D, calcium or any other minerals 
* if you have kidney problems 
* if you have heart problems and the doctor recommended to limit your daily fluid intake </p>
<p>Cases of serious, sometimes fatal allergic reaction have been reported in patients treated with 
intravenous ibandronic acid. 
If you experience one of the following symptoms, such as shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, tight 
feeling in throat, swelling of tongue, dizziness, feeling of loss of consciousness, redness or swelling of 
face, body rash, nausea and vomiting, you should immediately alert your doctor or nurse (see section 4). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Iasibon should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Iasibon 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
This is because Iasibon can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can 
affect the way Iasibon works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are receiving a type of antibiotic injection called 
‘aminoglycoside’ such as gentamicin. This is because aminoglycosides and Iasibon can both lower the 
amount of calcium in your blood.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not receive Iasibon if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or if you are breast-feeding. Ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You can drive and use machines as it’s expected that Iasibon has no or negligible effect on your ability 
to drive and use machines. Talk to your doctor first if you want to drive, use machines or tools.  </p>
<p>Iasibon contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Your doctor may do regular blood tests while you are receiving Iasibon. This is to check that you are 
being given the right amount of this medicine.  </p>
<p>How much to receive 
Your doctor will work out how much Iasibon you will be given depending on your illness.<br />
If you have breast cancer that has spread to your bones, then the recommended dose is 6 ampoules 
(6 mg) every 3-4 weeks, as an infusion in your vein over at least 15 minutes. </p>
<p>If you have a raised calcium level in your blood due to a tumour then the recommended dose is a single 
administration of 2 ampoules (2 mg) or 4 ampoules (4 mg), depending on the severity of your illness. 
The medicine should be administered as an infusion in your vein over two hours. A repeated dose may 
be considered in case of insufficient response or if your illness reappears. 
Your doctor may adjust your dose and duration of intravenous infusion if you have kidney problems. </p>
