<p>Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or

<p>Warnings and precautions 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very 
rarely in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving Ibandronic Acid Teva for cancer-related 
conditions. ONJ can also occur after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>It is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to 
treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions 
you should take. </p>
<p>Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease or a 
planned tooth extraction. </li>
<li>you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time. </li>
<li>you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems). </li>
<li>you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders). </li>
<li>you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone). </li>
<li>you have cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Ibandronic 
Acid Teva. </p>
<p>While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and 
receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you 
are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor 
about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Ibandronic Acid Teva. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ibandronic Acid Teva: 
 - if you are allergic to any other bisphosphonates 
- if you have any swallowing or digestion problems 
- if you have high or low blood levels of vitamin D or any other minerals 
- if you have kidney problems. </p>
<p>Irritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of 
severe pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting 
may occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of 
taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. If you develop these symptoms, stop taking Ibandronic Acid Teva and 
tell your doctor straight away (see sections 3 and 4). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Ibandronic Acid Teva should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ibandronic Acid Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Ibandronic Acid Teva can affect the way some other medicines work. Also 
some other medicines can affect the way Ibandronic Acid Teva works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium </li>
<li>acetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines called  NSAIDs , such as 
ibuprofen or naproxen. This is because NSAIDs and Ibandronic Acid Teva can both irritate your 
stomach and gut </li>
<li>a type of antibiotic injection called  aminoglycoside  such as gentamicin. This is because 
aminoglycosides and Ibandronic Acid Teva can both lower the amount of calcium in your blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>Taking medicines that reduce stomach acid such as cimetidine and ranitidine, may slightly increase the 
effects of Ibandronic Acid Teva. </p>
<p>Ibandronic Acid Teva with food and drink 
Do not take Ibandronic Acid Teva with food or any other drinks except water as Ibandronic Acid Teva 
is less effective if it is taken with food or drink (see section 3).  </p>
<p>Take Ibandronic Acid Teva with at least 6 hours after you had last had anything to eat, drink or any 
other medicines or supplements (e.g. products containing calcium (milk), aluminium, magnesium and 
iron) except water. After taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. Then you can have your first 
food and drink, and take any medicines or supplements (see section 3). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Ibandronic Acid Teva if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or if you are 
breast-feeding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You can drive and use machines as it s expected that Ibandronic Acid Teva has no or negligible effect 
on your ability to drive and use machines. Talk to your doctor first if you want to drive, use machine 
or tools. </p>
<p>Ibandronic Acid Teva contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Take your tablet at least 6 hours after you had last had anything to eat, drink or any other medicines or 
supplements except water. Water with a high concentration of calcium should not be used. If there is 
concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard water), it is advised to use 
bottled water with a low mineral content. </p>
<p>Your doctor may do regular blood tests while you are taking Ibandronic Acid Teva. This is to check 
that you are being given the right amount of medicine. </p>
<p>Taking this medicine 
It is important that you take Ibandronic Acid Teva at the right time and in the right way. This is 
because it can cause irritation, inflammation or ulcers in your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus). </p>
<p>You can help stop this happening by doing the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take your tablet as soon as you get up for the day before having your first food, drink, any 
medicine or supplements. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take your tablet with a full glass of water only (about 200 mL). Do not take your tablet with 
any drink other than water. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swallow the tablet whole. Do not chew, suck or crush the tablet. Do not let the tablet dissolve in 
your mouth. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. Then you can have your first food and drink, 
and take any medicines or supplements. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay upright (sitting or standing) while taking your tablet and for the next hour (60 minutes). 
Otherwise, some of the medicine could leak back into your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How much to take 
The usual dose of Ibandronic Acid Teva is one tablet each day. If you have moderate kidney problems, 
your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet every other day. If you have severe kidney problems, 
your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet each week. </p>
<p>If you take more Ibandronic Acid Teva than you should 
If you take too many tablets talk to a doctor or go to hospital straight away. Drink a full glass of milk 
before you go. Do not make yourself sick. Do not lie down. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Ibandronic Acid Teva 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are taking a tablet each day, skip the 
missed dose completely. Then carry on as usual the next day. If you are taking a tablet every other day 
or once a week, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Ibandronic Acid Teva 
Keep taking Ibandronic Acid Teva for as long as your doctor tells you. This is because the medicine 
will only work if it is taken all the time. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
