<p>Palbociclib works by blocking proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which regulate cell 
growth and division. Blocking these proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells and delay the 
progression of your cancer.  </p>
<p>IBRANCE is used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) which have spread beyond the original tumour 
and/or to other organs. It is given together with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, which are used as 
hormonal anticancer therapies. </p>         </div>"""

</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IBRANCE. </p>
<p>IBRANCE may reduce the number of your white blood cells and weaken your immune system. 
Therefore, you may be at greater risk of getting an infection while you are taking IBRANCE. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience signs or symptoms of an infection, such as 
chills or fever. </p>
<p>You will have regular blood tests during treatment to check whether IBRANCE affects your blood 
cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets).  </p>
<p>IBRANCE may cause blood clots in the veins. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience 
signs or symptoms of blood clots in the veins such as pain or stiffness, swelling and redness in the 
affected leg (or arm), chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness. </p>
<p>IBRANCE may cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs during treatment that can 
lead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms 
including: 
* difficulty breathing or shortness of breath 
* dry cough<br />
* chest pain </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>IBRANCE is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). </p>
<p>Other medicines and IBRANCE </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. IBRANCE may affect the way some other medicines work. </p>
<p>In particular, the following may increase the risk of side effects with IBRANCE: 
* Lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, telaprevir, and saquinavir used to treat HIV 
infection/AIDS. 
* Clarithromycin and telithromycin antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.<br />
* Voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole used to treat fungal infections. 
* Nefazodone used to treat depression. </p>
<p>The following medicines may have increased risk of side effects when given with IBRANCE:<br />
* Quinidine generally used to treat heart rhythm problems. 
* Colchicine used to treat gout. 
* Pravastatin and rosuvastatin used to treat high cholesterol levels. 
* Sulfasalazine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. 
* Alfentanil used for anaesthesia in surgery; fentanyl used in pre-procedures as a pain reliever as 
well as an anaesthetic. 
* Cyclosporine, everolimus, tacrolimus, and sirolimus used in organ transplantation to prevent 
rejection. 
* Dihydroergotamine and ergotamine used to treat migraine. 
* Pimozide used to treat schizophrenia and chronic psychosis. </p>
<p>The following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of IBRANCE:<br />
* Carbamazepine and phenytoin, used to stop seizures or fits. 
* Enzalutamide to treat prostate cancer. 
* Rifampin used to treat tuberculosis (TB). 
* St. John s Wort, an herbal product used to treat mild depression and anxiety. </p>
<p>IBRANCE with food and drink </p>
<p>Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are taking IBRANCE as it may increase the side 
effects of IBRANCE. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>You should not use IBRANCE if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>You should avoid becoming pregnant while taking IBRANCE. </p>
<p>Discuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you or your partner may become 
pregnant.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product, or their male partners 
should use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double-barrier contraception such as condom and 
diaphragm). These methods should be used during therapy and for at least 3 weeks after completing 
therapy for females and for at least 14 weeks for males. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed while taking IBRANCE. It is not known if IBRANCE is excreted in breast 
milk. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Palbociclib may decrease fertility in men. </p>
<p>Therefore, men may consider sperm preservation before taking IBRANCE. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Tiredness is a very common side effect of IBRANCE. If you feel unusually tired, take special care 
when driving or using machines. </p>
<p>IBRANCE contains lactose and sodium 
This medicine contains lactose (found in milk or dairy products). If you have been told by your doctor 
that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say it is essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
