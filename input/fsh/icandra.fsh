  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>The active substances of Icandra, vildagliptin and metformin, belong to a group of medicines called 
“oral antidiabetics”. </p>
<p>Icandra is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes is also known as non-
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Icandra is used when diabetes cannot be controlled by diet and 
exercise alone and/or with other medicines used to treat diabetes (insulin or sulphonylureas). </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body 
makes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. </p>
<p>Both insulin and glucagon are made in the pancreas. Insulin helps to lower the level of sugar in the 
blood, especially after meals. Glucagon triggers the liver to make sugar, causing the blood sugar level 
to rise. </p>
<p>How Icandra works 
Both active substances, vildagliptin and metformin, help to control the level of sugar in the blood. The 
substance vildagliptin works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. The 
substance metformin works by helping the body to make better use of insulin. This medicine has been 
shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent complications from your diabetes. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to vildagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic to any of these, talk to your doctor before 
taking Icandra. 
- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see “Risk of lactic 
acidosis” below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ketone 
bodies accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell. 
- if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your 
blood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems. 
- if you have severely reduced kidney function. 
- if you have a severe infection or are seriously dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your 
body). 
- if you are going to have a contrast x-ray (a specific type of x-ray involving an injectable dye). 
Please also see information about this in section “Warnings and precautions”. 
- if you have liver problems. 
- if you drink alcohol excessively (whether every day or only from time to time). 
- if you are breast-feeding (see also “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Risk of lactic acidosis 
Icandra may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your 
kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with 
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further 
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a 
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). 
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Icandra for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with 
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to 
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Icandra and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience 
some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: 
- vomiting 
- stomach ache (abdominal pain) 
- muscle cramps 
- a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness 
- difficulty in breathing 
- reduced body temperature and heartbeat </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. </p>
<p>Icandra is not a substitute for insulin. Therefore, you should not receive Icandra for the treatment of 
type 1 diabetes. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Icandra if you have or have had a disease of the 
pancreas. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Icandra if you are taking an anti-diabetic 
medicine known as a sulphonylurea. Your doctor may want to reduce your dose of the sulphonylurea 
when you take it together with Icandra in order to avoid low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). </p>
<p>If you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should 
not take this medicine. </p>
<p>Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also 
advised to pay particular attention to new onset of blisters or ulcers while taking Icandra. Should these 
occur, you should promptly consult your doctor. </p>
<p>If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Icandra during and for some time after the 
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Icandra. </p>
<p>A test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of Icandra treatment, at three-
month intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. This is so that signs of increased liver 
enzymes can be detected as early as possible. </p>
<p>During treatment with Icandra, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or 
more frequently if you are elderly and/or have worsening renal function. </p>
<p>Your doctor will test your blood and urine for sugar regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of Icandra in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Icandra 
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Icandra before or at the time of the 
injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with 
Icandra. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may 
need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests or your doctor may need to adjust the 
dosage of Icandra. It is especially important to mention the following: 
- glucocorticoids generally used to treat inflammation 
- beta-2 agonists generally used to treat respiratory disorders 
- other medicines used to treat diabetes 
- medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) 
- medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as 
ibuprofen and celecoxib) 
- certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists) 
- certain medicines affecting the thyroid 
- certain medicines affecting the nervous system 
- certain medicines used to treat angina (e.g. ranolazine) 
- certain medicines used to treat HIV infection (e.g. dolutegravir) 
- certain medicines used to treat a specific type of thyroid cancer (medullary thyroid cancer) (e.g. 
vandetanib) 
- certain medicines used to treat heartburn and peptic ulcers (e.g cimetidine) </p>
<p>Icandra with alcohol 
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Icandra since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis 
(please see section “Warnings and precautions”). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of 
taking Icandra during pregnancy. 
- Do not use Icandra if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also “Do not take Icandra”). </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you feel dizzy while taking Icandra, do not drive or use any tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose is one film-coated tablet of either 50 mg/850 mg or 50 mg/1000 mg taken

an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea your doctor may prescribe a lower dose. </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe this medicine alone or with certain other medicines that lower the level of 
sugar in your blood. </p>
<p>When and how to take Icandra 
- Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water, 
- Take one tablet in the morning and the other in the evening with or just after food. Taking the 
tablet just after food will lower the risk of an upset stomach. </p>
<p>Continue to follow any advice about diet that your doctor has given you. In particular, if you are 
following a diabetic weight control diet, continue with this while you are taking Icandra. </p>
<p>If you take more Icandra than you should 
If you take too many Icandra tablets, or if someone else takes your tablets, talk to a doctor or 
pharmacist immediately. Medical attention may be necessary. If you have to go to a doctor or 
hospital, take the pack and this leaflet with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Icandra 
If you forget to take a tablet, take it with your next meal unless you are due to take one then anyway. 
Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Icandra 
Continue to take this medicine as long as your doctor prescribes it so that it can continue to control 
your blood sugar. Do not stop taking Icandra unless your doctor tells you to. If you have any questions 
about how long to take this medicine, talk to your doctor. </p>
