  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Iclusig is used to treat adults with the following leukaemia types who are no longer benefiting from 
treatment with other medicines, or have a certain genetic difference known as a T315I mutation: 
* chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML): a blood cancer involving too many abnormal white blood 
cells in the blood and the bone marrow (where blood cells are formed). 
* Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL): a type of 
leukaemia involving too many immature white blood cells in the blood and blood forming bone 
marrow. In this kind of leukaemia, some of the DNA (genetic material) has become rearranged 
to form an abnormal chromosome, the Philadelphia chromosome. </p>
<p>Iclusig belongs to a group of medicines called tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In patients with CML and 
Ph+ ALL, changes in the DNA trigger a signal that tells the body to produce abnormal white blood 
cells. Iclusig blocks this signal, thereby stopping the production of these cells. </p>         </div>"""

increased. 
* liver tests 
Liver function tests will be performed periodically, as indicated by your doctor. </p>

patients treated with ponatinib. Symptoms may include sudden onset of severe headache, confusion,
