  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Idacio contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body s immune 
(defence) system.  </p>
<p>Idacio is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
  rheumatoid arthritis, 
  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,<br />
  enthesitis-related arthritis,<br />
  ankylosing spondylitis,<br />
  axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,<br />
  psoriatic arthritis,<br />
  psoriasis,<br />
  hidradenitis suppurativa,<br />
  Crohn s disease,<br />
  ulcerative colitis and<br />
  non-infectious uveitis  </p>
<p>The active substance in Idacio, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are 
proteins that attach to a specific target in the body.   </p>
<p>The target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is present at 
increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF , Idacio blocks its 
action and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these 
medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Idacio to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>Idacio can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous 
methotrexate treatment. </p>
<p>Idacio can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and 
improve physical function. </p>
<p>Usually, Idacio is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, 
Idacio can be given alone. </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of 
the joints that usually first appear in childhood. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 
17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may 
first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not 
work well enough, patients will be given Idacio to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
or enthesitis-related arthritis. </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. </p>
<p>Idacio is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other 
medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Idacio to reduce the signs 
and symptoms of your disease. </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Idacio can slow down the damage to the cartilage and 
bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis in adults and children </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin 
covered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, 
become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be 
caused by a problem with the body s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin 
cells. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Idacio is also used to treat severe 
plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines 
applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. </p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents </p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful 
inflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that 
may leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the 
armpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Idacio 
can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with 
the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you 
will be given Idacio. </p>
<p>Crohn s disease in adults and children </p>
<p>Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat Crohn s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn s 
disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, 
you will be given Idacio to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn s disease. </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis in adults and children </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If 
you have ulcerative colitis you may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well 
enough, you will be given Idacio to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis in adults and children </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation 
leads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that 
move across the field of vision). Idacio works by reducing this inflammation. </p>
<p>Idacio is used to treat: 
* adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye<br />
* children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the 
front of the eye. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>
<p>if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other 
opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is 
important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, 
feeling tired, dental problems (see  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Idacio </p>
<p>Allergic reaction </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash do not inject more Idacio and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare 
cases, these reactions can be life threatening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infection </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) 
consult your doctor before starting Idacio. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Idacio treatment. This risk may 
increase if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include 
tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual 
infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-
threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, 
feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Idacio. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) </p>
<ul>
<li>As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor 
will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Idacio. This will include a 
thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example 
chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on 
your patient reminder card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had 
tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. 
Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for 
tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild 
fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Travel/recurrent infection </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the 
risk of infections. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis B virus </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV 
infection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you 
for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some 
rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, 
reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Age over 65 years </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Idacio. You and 
your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with 
Idacio. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, 
wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Surgery or dental procedures </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking Idacio. 
Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Idacio. </li>
</ul>
<p>Demyelinating disease </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around 
the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue 
to receive Idacio. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, 
weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccine </p>
<ul>
<li>Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and 
should not be given during treatment with Idacio in case they cause infections. Check with your 
doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be given all 
the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Idacio. If you receive 
Idacio while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to 
about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell 
your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Idacio use during your 
pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Heart failure </p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have 
mild heart failure and you are being treated with Idacio, your heart failure status must be closely 
monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. 
shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale </p>
<ul>
<li>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or 
help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed 
very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop 
treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cancer </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking 
adalimumab or other TNF  blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have 
had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma  and 
leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Idacio the risk of 
getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and 
severe type of lymphoma, has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those 
patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if 
you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Idacio. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking 
adalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks 
or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor 
whether treatment with a TNF  blocker is appropriate for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>On rare occasions, treatment with Idacio could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your 
doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Idacio. </li>
<li>Do not give Idacio to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 
2 years. </li>
<li>Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe or 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are 
recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Idacio </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Idacio can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents 
(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or 
pain medicines including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). </p>
<p>You should not take Idacio with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due 
to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other 
TNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk 
for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you 
have questions, please ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist 
for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Idacio 
and for at least 5 months after the last Idacio injection. If you become pregnant, you should see your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Idacio should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. </p>
<p>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not 
receive adalimumab. </p>
<p>Idacio can be used during breast-feeding. </p>
<p>If you receive Idacio during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals about 
your Idacio use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information 
see section on vaccination). </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Idacio may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning 
sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Idacio. </p>
<p>Idacio contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
