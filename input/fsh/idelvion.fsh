IDELVION is a haemophilia medicine that replaces a natural blood clotting (coagulation) factor IX. 
The active substance in IDELVION is albutrepenonacog alfa (recombinant fusion protein linking 
coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX-FP)).
Factor IX is involved in blood clotting. Patients with haemophilia B have a lack of this factor which 
means that their blood does not clot as quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. 
IDELVION works by replacing factor IX in haemophilia B patients to enable their blood to clot.
What is IDELVION used for?
IDELVION is used to prevent or to halt bleeding caused by the lack of factor IX in patients of all age 
groups with haemophilia B (also called congenital factor IX deficiency or Christmas disease).</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
It is strongly recommended that every time you use IDELVION, you record the name and batch 
number of the product to keep track of the products and product batches you have used. .
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IDELVION.</p>
<p>Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. The product contains traces of hamster 
proteins (see also  Do not use IDELVION ). If symptoms of allergic reactions occur, you 
should stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor or the treatment 
centre where you are followed. Your doctor should inform you of the early signs of 
hypersensitivity reactions. These include hives, generalised skin rash, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, low blood pressure (hypotension), and anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction that 
causes severe difficulty in breathing, or dizziness).</p>
<p>Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, your initial administration of 
IDELVION should be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for 
allergic reactions can be provided. </p>
<p>The formation of inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) is a known complication that has been 
reported during treatment with IDELVION. The inhibitors stop the treatment from working
properly. If your bleeding is not being controlled with IDELVION, tell your doctor 
immediately. You should be monitored regularly for the development of inhibitors. </p>
<p>If you suffer from liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had major surgery, please 
inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk for blood clotting (coagulation) complications.</p>
<p>If you need a central venous access device (CVAD for injection of IDELVION), the risk of 
complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood (bacteraemia) and the formation 
of a blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the catheter is inserted should be 
considered by your doctor.
Other medicines and IDELVION</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>During pregnancy and breast-feeding, IDELVION should be given only if it is clearly needed.
Driving and using machines
IDELVION does not effect your ability to drive and use machines.
IDELVION contains sodium
This medicine contains up to 8.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

blood clotting disorders. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with 
your doctor if you are not sure.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of IDELVION you need. The amount of IDELVION you need to 
take and the duration of treatment depend on:</p>

IDELVION is administered as an injection into a vein (intravenous, IV) after reconstitution of the 
powder with the provided solvent by your doctor or nurse. You or somebody else might also 
administer IDELVION as an IV injection but only after receiving adequate training.
If you use more IDELVION than you should 
Please contact your doctor immediately if you inject more IDELVION than your doctor recommends.
If you stop using IDELVION 
Do not stop using IDELVION without consulting your doctor.
Reconstitution and administration
General Instructions</p>
<p>The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial while keeping 
the medicine sterile (germ free). Your doctor will show you how to prepare the solution and 
how to withdraw the solution from the vial correctly.</p>
<p>IDELVION must not be mixed with other medicines or solvents except those mentioned in 
section 6.<br />
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, yellow to colourless, i.e. it might be 
sparkling when held up to the light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or 
withdrawal (see below) the solution should be visually checked, before it is used. Do not use the 
solution if it is cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles.</p>
<p>Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements and as instructed by your doctor. 
Reconstitution
Without opening the vials, warm the IDELVION powder and the liquid to room or body temperature. 
This can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by holding them 
in your hands for a few minutes. 
DO NOT expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37  C).
Carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an 
alcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter 
transfer device), then follow the instructions given below.
1
1. Open the Mix2Vial by peeling off the lid. Do not
remove the Mix2Vial from the blister package!
2
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the 
blister package and push the spike of the blue adapter 
end straight down through the solvent vial stopper.
3
3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package 
and not the Mix2Vial set.
4
4. Place the IDELVION powder vial on an even and firm 
surface. Invert the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set 
attached and push the spike of the transparent adapter 
end straight down through the IDELVION vial 
stopper. The solvent will automatically flow into the 
IDELVION vial.
5
5. With one hand grasp the IDELVION side of the 
Mix2Vial set and with the other hand grasp the solvent-
side and unscrew the set carefully counter-clockwise 
into two pieces. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached.
6
6. Gently swirl the IDELVION vial with the transparent 
adapter attached until the substance is fully dissolved. 
Do not shake.
7
7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the 
IDELVION vial is upright, connect the syringe to the 
Mix2Vial's Luer Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. 
Inject air into the IDELVION vial.
Withdrawal and administration
8
8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the 
syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.
9
9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and 
disconnect the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the 
syringe by unscrewing counter-clockwise.
Use the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. Let blood flow back 
to the end of the tube. Attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. Inject
the reconstituted solution slowly (as comfortable for you, up to a maximum of 5 ml/min) into the 
vein following the instructions given to you by your doctor. Take care not to get any blood in the 
syringe containing the product.
Check yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. If you have any side effects that 
might be related to the administration of IDELVION, the injection should be stopped (see also sections
2 and 4).
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
