Irbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing 
them to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of 
angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower.
Hydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased 
urine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure.
The two active ingredients in Ifirmacombi work together to lower blood pressure further than if either 
was given alone.
Ifirmacombi is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or 
hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic  to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
-
if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines
-
if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Ifirmacombi in early 
pregnancy   see pregnancy section)
-
if you have severe liver or kidney problems
-
if you have difficulty in producing urine
-
if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in 
your blood
-
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Ifirmacombi and if any of the following apply to you:
-
if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea
-
if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant
-
if you suffer from heart problems
-
if you suffer from liver problems
-
if you suffer from diabetes
-
if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes
-
if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE)
-
if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the 
hormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood 
pressure).
-
if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase 
the risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin 
from sun exposure and UV rays while taking Ifirmacombi.
-
if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath 
or difficulty breathing after taking Ifirmacombi, seek medical attention immediately.
-
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:
-
an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems
-
Aliskiren
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals.
See also information under the heading  Do not take Ifirmacombi .
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Ifirmacombi is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).
You should also tell your doctor:
-
if you are on a low-salt diet
-
if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle 
pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an 
excessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Ifirmacombi)
-
if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn 
(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal
-
if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics
-
if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking 
Ifirmacombi. This could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of the eye 
(choroidal effusion) or a sign that you are developing glaucoma, increased pressure in your 
eye(s), and can happen within hours to weeks of taking Ifirmacombi. This can lead to permanent 
vision loss, if not treated. If you earlier have had a penicillin or sulfonamide allergy, you can be 
at higher risk of developing this. You should discontinue Ifirmacombi treatment and seek 
medical attention.
The hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping 
test.
Children and adolescents
Ifirmacombi should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years).
Other medicines and Ifirmacombi
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Diuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Ifirmacombi may have an effect on other 
medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with Ifirmacombi without close 
supervision by your doctor.
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions:
-
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not 
take Ifirmacombi  and  Warnings and precautions )
You may need to have blood checks if you take:
-
potassium supplements
-
salt substitutes containing potassium
-
potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets)
-
some laxatives
-
medicines for the treatment of gout
-
therapeutic vitamin D supplements
-
medicines to control heart rhythm
-
medicines for diabetes (oral agents as repaglinide or insulins)
-
carbamazepine (a medicine for the treatment of epilepsy).
It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, 
steroids, and medicines to treat cancer, pain killers, arthritis medicines or colestyramine and colestipol 
resins for lowering blood cholesterol.
Ifirmacombi with food, drink and alcohol
Ifirmacombi can be taken with or without food.
Due to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Ifirmacombi, if you drink alcohol while on treatment with 
this medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, specially when getting 
up from a sitting position.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Pregnancy
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Ifirmacombi before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Ifirmacombi. Ifirmacombi is not 
recommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Ifirmacombi is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.
Driving and using machines
Ifirmacombi is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally 
dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, 
talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines.
Ifirmacombi contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially "sodium-
free".</p>         </div>"""
