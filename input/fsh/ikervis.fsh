transparent front part of the eye (cornea). 
- if you are taking any medicines containing steroids.

remove your contact lenses at bedtime before using IKERVIS; you can reinsert them when you wake 
up. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
IKERVIS should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and IKERVIS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids with IKERVIS as these might 
increase the risk of side effects. </p>
<p>IKERVIS eye drops should be used at least 15 minutes after any other eye drops are used. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>IKERVIS should not be used if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>If you could become pregnant you must use contraception while using this medicine. </p>
<p>IKERVIS is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to 
your doctor before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your vision may be blurred immediately after using IKERVIS eye drops. If this happens, wait until 
your vision clears before you drive or use machines. </p>
<p>IKERVIS contains cetalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains 0.05 mg cetalkonium chloride in 1 mL. You should remove contact lenses 
before using this medicine and you can reinsert them when you wake up. Cetalkonium chloride may 
cause eye irritation. If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this 
medicine, talk to your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Wash your hands. </p>
<p>If you wear contact lenses, take them out at bedtime before using the drops; you can reinsert 
them when you wake up. </p>
<p>Open the aluminium pouch, which contains 5 single-dose containers. </p>
<p>Take one single-dose container from the aluminium pouch. </p>
<p>Gently shake the single dose container prior to use. </p>
<p>Twist off the cap (picture 1). </p>
<p>Pull down your lower eyelid (picture 2). </p>
<p>Tilt your head back and look up at the ceiling. </p>
<p>Gently squeeze one drop of the medicine onto your eye. Make sure you do not touch your eye 
with the tip of the single-dose container. </p>
<p>Blink a few times so that the medicine covers your eye. </p>
<p>After using IKERVIS, press a finger into the corner of your eye by the nose and close gently 
the eyelids for 2 minutes (picture 3). This helps to stop IKERVIS getting into the rest of the 
body. </p>
<p>If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. </p>
<p>Discard the single dose container as soon as you have used it, even if there is still some 
medicine left in it. </p>
<p>The remaining single-dose containers should be kept in the aluminium pouch. </p>
<p>If a drop misses your eye, try again. </p>
<p>If you use more IKERVIS than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more drops 
until it is time for your next regular dose. </p>
<p>If you forget to use IKERVIS, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than one drop each day in the affected eye(s). </p>
<p>If you stop using IKERVIS without speaking to your doctor, the inflammation of the transparent 
front part of your eye (known as keratitis) will not be controlled and could lead to impaired vision. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
