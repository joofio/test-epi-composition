  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Ilaris is 
Ilaris contains the active substance canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a group of 
medicines called interleukin inhibitors. It blocks the activity of a substance called interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1 beta) in the body, which is present at increased levels in inflammatory diseases. </p>
<p>What Ilaris is used for 
Ilaris is used for treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
- Periodic fever syndromes: 
* Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), 
* Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), 
* Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), 
* Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). 
- Still’s disease including adult onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (SJIA) 
- Gouty arthritis </p>
<p>More information on each of these diseases is given below. </p>
<p>Periodic fever syndromes 
Ilaris is used in adults and children aged 2 years and older to treat the following: 
- Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) – this is a group of auto-inflammatory 
diseases, which include: 
* Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), 
* Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), also called chronic infantile 
neurological, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), 
* Severe forms of familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome (FCAS) / familial cold 
urticaria (FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin 
rash. 
- Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) 
- Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) also known as mevalonate kinase deficiency 
(MKD) 
- Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): Ilaris is used to treat FMF. Ilaris can be used together with 
colchicine, if appropriate. </p>
<p>In patients with periodic fever syndromes (CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD and FMF), the body produces 
too much IL-1 beta. This may cause fever, headache, fatigue, skin rash, or painful joints and muscles. 
By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may improve these symptoms. </p>
<p>Still’s disease 
Ilaris is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat active Still’s disease including adult-onset 
Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and 
older if other treatments have not worked well enough. Ilaris can be used alone or in combination with 
methotrexate. </p>
<p>Still’s disease including SJIA and AOSD is an inflammatory disease that can cause pain, swelling and 
inflammation of one or more joints, as well as rash and fever. A pro-inflammatory protein called IL-1 
beta plays an important role in Still’s disease inflammation. Ilaris blocks the activity of IL-1 beta, 
which may improve the signs and symptoms of Still’s disease. </p>
<p>Gouty arthritis 
Ilaris is used in adults to treat the symptoms of frequent gouty arthritis attacks if other treatments have 
not worked well enough. </p>
<p>Gouty arthritis is caused by the formation of urate crystals. These crystals cause excessive production 
of IL-1 beta, which in turn can lead to sudden, severe pain, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint 
(known as a gouty arthritis attack). By blocking the activity of IL-1 beta, Ilaris may lead to an 
improvement in these symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Ilaris 
- if you are allergic to canakinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have, or suspect you have, an active and severe infection. </p>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Ilaris if any of the following applies to you: 
− 
if you currently have an infection or if you have had repeated infections or a condition such as a 
known low level of white blood cells which makes you more likely to get infections. 
− 
if you have or have ever had tuberculosis or direct contact with a person with an active 
tuberculosis infection. Your doctor may check whether you have tuberculosis using a specific 
test. 
− 
if you have signs of a liver disorder such as yellow skin and eyes, nausea, loss of appetite, dark-
coloured urine and light-coloured stools. 
− 
if you need to have any vaccinations. You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of 
vaccine called a live vaccine while being treated with Ilaris (see also “Other medicines and 
Ilaris”). </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately 
- If you have ever developed an atypical, widespread rash or skin peeling after taking Ilaris. 
The serious skin reaction, DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), has 
rarely been reported in association with Ilaris treatment, predominantly in patients with systemic 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Seek medical attention immediately if you notice an atypical, 
widespread rash, which may occur in conjuction with high body temperature and enlarged 
lymph nodes. </p>
<p>Still’s disease 
− 
Patients with Still’s disease may develop a condition called macrophage activation syndrome 
(MAS), which can be life-threatening. Your doctor will monitor you for potential triggering 
factors of MAS that include infections and re-activation of the underlying Still’s disease (flare). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
− 
CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, FMF and SJIA: Ilaris can be used in children aged 2 years and 
older. 
− 
Gouty arthritis: Ilaris is not recommended for children or adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ilaris 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
− 
Live vaccines: You are advised to avoid being vaccinated with a type of vaccine called a live 
vaccine while you are being treated with Ilaris. Your doctor may want to check your vaccination 
history and give you any vaccinations that you have missed before you start treatment with 
Ilaris. If you need to be given a live vaccine after starting treatment with Ilaris, discuss this with 
your doctor. A live vaccine should normally be given 3 months after your last injection of Ilaris 
and 3 months before the next one. 
− 
Medicines called tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, such as etanercept, adalimumab or 
infliximab. These are used mainly in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases. They should not be 
used with Ilaris because this may increase the risk of infections. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
− 
You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using 
Ilaris and for at least 3 months after the last Ilaris treatment. It is important to tell your doctor if 
you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor 
will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Ilaris during pregnancy. 
− 
If you received canakinumab while you were pregnant, it is important that you inform the 
baby’s doctor or nurse before any vaccinations are given to your baby. Your baby should not 
receive live vaccines until at least 16 weeks after you received your last dose of canakinumab 
before giving birth. 
− 
It is not known whether Ilaris passes into human milk. Your doctor will discuss with you the 
potential risks of taking Ilaris before breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ilaris treatment may give you a spinning sensation (dizziness or vertigo) or intense tiredness 
(asthenia). This may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel a spinning 
sensation or feel tired, do not drive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling normal again. </p>         </div>"""
