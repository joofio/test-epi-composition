This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, a substance found in the body 
which is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses and which is present at increased levels 
in diseases such as psoriasis. </p>
<p>Ilumetri is used to treat a skin condition called plaque psoriasis, in adults with moderate to severe disease.<br />
Using Ilumetri will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms. </p>         </div>"""
