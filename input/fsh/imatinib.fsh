inhibiting the growth of abnormal cells in the diseases listed below. These include some types of 
cancer. </p>
<p>Imatinib Accord is a treatment for adults and children and adolescents for: </p>
<p>Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white 
cells usually help the body to fight infection. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a form of leukaemia 
in which certain abnormal white cells (named myeloid cells) start growing out of control. </p>
<p>Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-positive ALL). 
Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight 
infection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a form of leukaemia in which certain abnormal 
white cells (named lymphoblasts) start growing out of control. Imatinib Accord inhibits the 
growth of these cells.  </p>
<p>Imatinib Accord is a treatment for adults for: </p>
<p>Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD). These are a group of blood 
diseases in which some blood cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Accord inhibits the 
growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. </p>
<p>Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). These 
are blood diseases in which some blood cells (named eosinophils) start growing out of control. 
Imatinib Accord inhibits the growth of these cells in a certain subtype of these diseases. </p>
<p>Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). GIST is a cancer of the stomach and bowels. It 
arises from uncontrolled cell growth of the supporting tissues of these organs. </p>
<p>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cancer of the tissue beneath the skin in 
which some cells start growing out of control. Imatinib Accord inhibits the growth of these cells. </p>
<p>In the rest of this leaflet, we will use the abbreviations when talking about these diseases. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Imatinib Accord works or why this medicine has been prescribed 
for you, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

cancers or solid tumours. </p>
<p>Follow all your doctor s instructions carefully, even if they differ from the general information 
contained in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Do not take Imatinib Accord </p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to imatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>If this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking Imatinib Accord. </p>
<p>If you think you may be allergic but are not sure, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Imatinib Accord:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have ever had a liver, kidney or heart problem. </li>
<li>if you are taking the medicine levothyroxine because your thyroid has been removed. </li>
<li>if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Imatinib Accord 
could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will 
be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. </li>
<li>if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking Imatinib Accord, 
contact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA). </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Imatinib Accord. </p>
<p>You may become more sensitive to the sun while taking Imatinib Accord. It is important to cover sun-
exposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). These precautions are 
also applicable to children. </p>
<p>During treatment with Imatinib Accord, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very 
quickly. Imatinib Accord may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention). </p>
<p>While you are taking Imatinib Accord, your doctor will regularly check whether the medicine is 
working. You will also have blood tests and be weighed regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Imatinib Accord is also a treatment for children and adolescents with CML. There is no experience in 
children and adolescents with CML below 2 years of age. There is limited experience in children and 
adolescents with Ph-positive ALL and very limited experience in children and adolescents with 
MDS/MPD, DFSP, GIST and HES/CEL. 
Some children and adolescents taking Imatinib Accord may have slower than normal growth. The 
doctor will monitor the growth at regular visits. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Imatinib Accord </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (such as paracetamol) and including 
herbal medicines (such as St. John s Wort). Some medicines can interfere with the effect of Imatinib 
Accord when taken together. They may increase or decrease the effect of Imatinib Accord, either 
leading to increased side effects or making Imatinib Accord less effective. Imatinib Accord may do the 
same to some other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent the formation of blood clots. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </li>
<li>Imatinib Accord is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary as it may harm 
your baby. Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks of taking Imatinib Accord 
during pregnancy. </li>
<li>Women who might become pregnant are advised to use effective contraception during treatment 
and for 15 days after ending treatment. </li>
<li>Do not breast-feed during the treatment with Imatinib Accord and for 15 days after ending 
treatment, as it may harm your baby. </li>
<li>Patients who are concerned about their fertility while taking Imatinib Accord are advised to 
consult with their doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You may feel dizzy or drowsy or get blurred vision while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not 
drive or use any tools or machines until you are feeling well again. </p>         </div>"""

Imatinib Accord given will depend on your child s condition, body weight and height. The total daily 
dose in children and adolescents must not exceed 800 mg with CML and 600 mg with Ph+ALL. The 
treatment can either be given to your child as a once-daily dose or alternatively the daily dose can be 
split into two administrations (half in the morning and half in the evening). </p>
