IMBRUVICA is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance ibrutinib. It belongs to a 
class of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors.
What IMBRUVICA is used for
It is used to treat the following blood cancers in adults:</p>
<p>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a type of cancer affecting the lymph nodes, when the disease has 
come back or has not responded to treatment.</p>
<p>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called 
lymphocytes that also involves the lymph nodes. IMBRUVICA is used in patients who have not 
previously been treated for CLL or when the disease has come back or has not responded to 
treatment.</p>
<p>Waldenstr m s macroglobulinaemia (WM), a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called 
lymphocytes. It is used in patients who have not previously been treated for WM or when the 
disease has come back or has not responded to treatment or in patients for whom chemotherapy 
given together with an antibody is not a suitable therapy.
How IMBRUVICA works
In MCL, CLL and WM, IMBRUVICA works by blocking Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a protein in the 
body that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking this protein, IMBRUVICA helps kill 
and reduce the number of cancer cells. It also slows down the worsening of the cancer.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to ibrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)</p>
<p>if you are taking a herbal medicine called St. John s Wort, used for depression. If you are not 
sure about this, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IMBRUVICA:</p>
<p>if you have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements that 
increase your risk of bleeding (see section  Other medicines and IMBRUVICA )</p>
<p>if you have irregular heart beat or have a history of irregular heart beat or severe heart failure, or 
if you feel any of the following: shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, light-headedness, 
fainting or near fainting, chest pain or swollen legs</p>
<p>if you have liver problems, including if you ever had or now have a hepatitis B infection (a liver 
infection)</p>
<p>if you have high blood pressure</p>
<p>if you have recently had any surgery, especially if this might affect how you absorb food or 
medicines from your stomach or gut</p>
<p>if you are planning to have any surgery  your doctor may ask you to stop taking IMBRUVICA
for a short time (3 to 7 days) before and after your surgery</p>
<p>if you have kidney problems.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
or while taking this medicine (see section  Possible side effects ).
When taking IMBRUVICA, tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: 
memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss   these may be due to a very rare but 
serious brain infection which can be fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML).
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice or someone notices in you: sudden numbness or weakness 
in the limbs (especially on one side of the body), sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding 
speech, sight loss, difficulty walking, loss of balance or lack of coordination, sudden severe headache 
with no known cause. These may be signs and symptoms of stroke.
Tell your doctor immediately if you develop left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib 
cage or at the tip of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of rupture of the spleen) after you stop 
taking IMBRUVICA.
Effects on the heart
Treatment with IMBRUVICA may affect the heart, especially if you already have heart diseases such 
as rhythm problems, heart failure, high blood pressure, have diabetes or are of advanced age. The 
effects may be severe and could cause death, including sometimes sudden death. Your heart function 
will be checked before and during treatment with IMBRUVICA. Tell your doctor immediately if you 
feel breathless, have difficulty breathing when lying down, swelling of the feet, ankles or legs and 
weakness/tiredness during treatment with IMBRUVICA   these may be signs of heart failure.
You may experience viral, bacterial, or fungal infections during treatment with IMBRUVICA. Contact 
your doctor if you have fever, chills, weakness, confusion, body aches, cold or flu symptoms, feel tired 
or feel short of breath, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). These could be signs of an infection.
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
There have been rare reports of excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation 
(haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. If you 
experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, bruising, or skin rash, contact your 
doctor immediately.
Tests and check-ups before and during treatment
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast breakdown 
of cancer cells have happened during treatment of cancer and sometimes even without treatment. This 
may lead to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor or another 
healthcare provider may do blood tests to check for TLS.
Lymphocytosis: Laboratory tests may show an increase in white blood cells (called  lymphocytes ) in 
your blood in the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This 
does not necessarily mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood 
counts before or during the treatment and in rare cases they may need to give you another medicine. 
Talk to your doctor about what your test results mean.
Events related to the liver: Your doctor will do some blood tests to check whether your liver is 
working properly or that you do not have a liver infection, known as viral hepatitis, or whether 
hepatitis B has become active again, which could be fatal.
Children and adolescents
IMBRUVICA should not be used in children and adolescents.
Other medicines and IMBRUVICA
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and 
supplements. This is because IMBRUVICA may affect the way some other medicines work. Also
some other medicines can affect the way IMBRUVICA works.
IMBRUVICA may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take 
other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes:</p>
<p>acetyl salicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or 
naproxen</p>
<p>blood thinners such as warfarin, heparin or other medicines for blood clots</p>
<p>supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking IMBRUVICA.
Also tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines   The effects of IMBRUVICA or 
other medicines may be influenced if you take IMBRUVICA together with any of the following
medicines:</p>
<p>medicines called antibiotics to treat bacterial infections   clarithromycin, telithromycin, 
ciprofloxacin, erythromycin or rifampicin</p>
<p>medicines for fungal infections   posaconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole or 
voriconazole</p>
<p>medicines for HIV infection   ritonavir, cobicistat, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, 
atazanavir, or fosamprenavir</p>
<p>medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy - aprepitant</p>
<p>medicines for depression - nefazodone</p>
<p>medicines called kinase inhibitors for treatment of other cancers   crizotinib or imatinib</p>
<p>medicines called calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure or chest pain   diltiazem or
verapamil</p>
<p>medicines called statins to treat high cholesterol - rosuvastatin</p>
<p>heart medicines/anti-arrhythmics   amiodarone or dronedarone</p>
<p>medicines to prevent seizures or to treat epilepsy, or medicines to treat a painful condition of the 
face called trigeminal neuralgia   carbamazepine or phenytoin.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking IMBRUVICA.
If you are taking digoxin, a medicine used for heart problems, or methotrexate, a medicine used to 
treat other cancers and to reduce the activity of the immune system (e.g., for rheumatoid arthritis or 
psoriasis), it should be taken at least 6 hours before or after IMBRUVICA.
IMBRUVICA with food
Do not take IMBRUVICA with grapefruit or Seville oranges (bitter oranges)   this includes 
eating them, drinking the juice or taking a supplement that might contain them. This is because it can 
increase the amount of IMBRUVICA in your blood.

pregnancy. There is no information about the safety of IMBRUVICA in pregnant women.
Women of childbearing age must use a highly effective method of birth control during and up to three 
months after receiving IMBRUVICA, to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with 
IMBRUVICA. </p>
