  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>IMFINZI contains the active substance durvalumab which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. IMFINZI works by helping your immune 
system fight your cancer.
IMFINZI is used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. It 
is used alone when your NSCLC:</p>
<p>has spread within your lung and cannot be removed by surgery, and</p>
<p>has responded or stabilised after initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
It is used in combination with tremelimumab and chemotherapy when your NSCLC:</p>
<p>has spread within both your lungs (and/or to other parts of the body), cannot be removed by 
surgery and</p>
<p>has shown no changes (mutations) in genes called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) or 
ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase).
IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy is used to treat a type of lung cancer called extensive-
stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in adults. It is used when your SCLC:</p>
<p>has spread within your lungs (or to other parts of the body) and</p>
<p>has not previously been treated.
IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy is used in adults to treat a type of cancer of the bile ducts 
(cholangiocarcinoma) and gallbladder that are collectively referred to as biliary tract cancers (BTC). It 
is used when your BTC:</p>
<p>has spread within your bile ducts and gallbladder (or to other parts of the body).
IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab is used to treat a type of liver cancer called advanced or 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults. It is used when your HCC: </p>
<p>cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and</p>
<p>may have spread within your liver or to other parts of the body. 
If you have any questions about how IMFINZI works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
When IMFINZI is given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines, it is important that you also 
read the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, 
ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""
