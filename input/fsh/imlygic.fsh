skin or to the lymph nodes, when surgery is not an option. </p>
<p>The active ingredient of Imlygic is talimogene laherparepvec. This is a weakened form of herpes 
simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), which is commonly called the cold sore virus. To get Imlygic from 
HSV-1, the virus has been changed so that it multiplies more effectively in tumours than in normal 
cells. This leads to destruction of infected tumour cells. This medicine also works by helping your 
immune system to recognise and destroy tumours throughout your body. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You will not be given Imlygic: 
- if you are allergic to talimogene laherparepvec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if your healthcare professional has told you that you have a severely weakened immune system. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your healthcare professional before being given this medicine. </p>
<p>Life-threatening herpes infection </p>
<p>Life-threatening herpes infection including spreading to any part of the body far from the injection site 
(disseminated herpetic infection) may occur. If you have any new or worsening symptoms, tell your 
healthcare professional immediately. Tell your healthcare professional if you have or have ever had a 
weakened immune system, if you have HIV/AIDS, blood or bone marrow cancer, or if you are taking 
steroids or other medicines that suppress your immune system because you may be at increased risk of 
life-threatening herpes infection. </p>
<p>Accidental spread of Imlygic to yourself and others </p>
<p>Imlygic can be spread to other parts of your body or to other people through direct contact with your 
body fluids or injection sites. </p>
<p>You should do the following to avoid spreading Imlygic to other areas of your body or to your close 
contacts (close contacts include household members, caregivers, sex partners, or someone you share a 
bed with): 
* Avoid direct contact between your injection sites or body fluids (e.g. blood and urine) and close 
contacts (e.g. use latex condoms when engaging in sexual activity, avoid kissing close contacts 
if either of you has an open mouth sore) while you are being treated with this medicine and up 
to 30 days after your last dose. 
* Avoid touching or scratching the injection sites. 
* Keep injection sites covered with airtight and watertight dressings at all times. Apply the 
dressing as instructed by your healthcare professional. If the dressing comes loose or falls off, 
replace it immediately with a clean dressing. 
* Place all used dressings and cleaning materials in a sealed plastic bag and throw them away in 
your household waste. </p>
<p>You should tell your close contacts to: 
* Avoid direct contact with your body fluids or injection sites. 
* Wear gloves while changing your dressing. </p>
<p>If your close contacts are accidentally exposed to Imlygic, they should clean the affected area on their 
body with soap and water and/or a disinfectant. If they develop signs or symptoms of herpes infection, 
you should ask them to contact their healthcare professional. If herpetic lesions (blisters or sores) are 
suspected, patients or close contacts have the option of follow-up testing by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder for further characterisation of the infection. Please discuss with your healthcare 
professional. </p>
<p>Close contacts who are pregnant or who have a weakened immune system, and newborns </p>
<p>Ensure that your close contacts who are pregnant or who have a weakened immune system do not 
touch injection sites, used dressings and cleaning materials. Keep used dressings and cleaning 
materials away from newborns. </p>
<p>Herpes infection </p>
<p>Cold sores or a more serious herpes infection may occur during or after treatment with Imlygic. Signs 
and symptoms related to treatment with Imlygic may be the same as for herpes infections, and include 
but are not limited to pain, burning or tingling in a blister around the mouth, genitals, on the fingers or 
ears, eye pain, light sensitivity, discharge from the eyes, or blurry vision, weakness in arms or legs, 
extreme drowsiness (feeling sleepy), and mental confusion. If you have these signs or any new 
symptoms, you should follow standard hygiene practices to prevent viral transmission to others. If 
herpetic lesions (blisters or sores) are suspected, patients or close contacts have the option of follow-
up testing by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for further characterisation of the infection. Please 
discuss with your healthcare professional. </p>
<p>Infection and delayed healing at injection site </p>
<p>Imlygic may cause infection at the injection site. Signs and symptoms of infection include pain, 
redness, warmth, swelling, discharge or a sore (ulcer), fever, and chills. The injection site may take 
longer to heal than normal. You should tell your healthcare professional if you notice any of these 
symptoms. </p>
<p>Autoimmune reactions </p>
<p>Imlygic may cause autoimmune reactions (an over-reaction of the body’s immune system). Some 
people taking this medicine have developed inflammation in the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), 
narrowing or blockage of blood vessels (vasculitis), swelling of the lungs (pneumonitis), worsening 
skin scaling (psoriasis), and areas of skin without any colour (vitiligo). Inform your healthcare 
professional if you have a history of autoimmune disease. </p>
<p>Plasmacytoma </p>
<p>Imlygic may cause cancerous white blood cells to gather at or near the injection site (plasmacytoma). 
Inform your healthcare professional if you have a history of blood cancer including multiple myeloma. </p>
<p>Difficulty breathing </p>
<p>If you have a tumour in your neck, your healthcare professional may warn you that you might 
experience compression of your airways during treatment. </p>
<p>Patients with no prior herpes infection </p>
<p>If you have never had herpes infection in the past, you may be more likely to get fever, chills, and 
flu-like illness within the period of the first 6 treatments. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Imlygic is not recommended for children and adolescents since the effects of this medicine in people 
younger than 18 years old are not known. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Imlygic </p>
<p>Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines, such as acyclovir, to treat or prevent herpes infections. Acyclovir and 
other anti-viral treatments may decrease the effects of Imlygic. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Ask your healthcare professional for advice if you: 
* think you may be pregnant; or 
* are planning to have a baby. 
Your healthcare professional will determine if Imlygic is right for you. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your healthcare professional for advice before being given 
this medicine. Imlygic may harm your unborn baby. </p>
<p>Women who are able to become pregnant should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy 
during treatment with Imlygic. Talk to your healthcare professional about suitable methods of 
contraception. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Imlygic passes into breast milk. It is important to tell your healthcare 
professional if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. They will then help you decide whether to stop 
breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Imlygic, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to 
the baby and the benefit of Imlygic to you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>When you are being treated with Imlygic you may experience symptoms such as dizziness or 
confusion. This may impair your ability to drive or operate machinery. Use caution when driving or 
operating machinery until you are certain that this medicine does not adversely affect you. </p>
<p>Imlygic contains sodium and sorbitol </p>
<p>This medicine contains 7.7 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 1 mL vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains 20 mg sorbitol in each 1 mL vial. </p>         </div>"""
