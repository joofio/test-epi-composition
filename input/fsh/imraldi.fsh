  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Imraldi contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body s immune 
(defence) system. </p>
<p>Imraldi is intended for treatment of: </p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis,  </p>
<p>polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, </p>
<p>enthesitis-related arthritis,  </p>
<p>ankylosing spondylitis,  </p>
<p>axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,  </p>
<p>psoriatic arthritis,  </p>
<p>psoriasis,  </p>
<p>hidradenitis suppurativa,  </p>
<p>Crohn s disease,  </p>
<p>ulcerative colitis and  </p>
<p>non-infectious uveitis.  </p>
<p>The active ingredient in Imraldi, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are 
proteins that attach to a specific target. </p>
<p>The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is present at 
increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF , Imraldi decreases 
the process of inflammation in these diseases. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. 
Imraldi is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these 
medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>Imraldi can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous 
methotrexate treatment. </p>
<p>Imraldi can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and 
improve physical function. </p>
<p>Usually, Imraldi is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, 
Imraldi can be given alone. </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of 
the joints that usually first appear in childhood. </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 
17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may 
first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not 
work well enough, patients will be given Imraldi to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
or enthesitis-related arthritis. </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other 
medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Imraldi to reduce the signs 
and symptoms of your disease. </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Imraldi can slow down the damage to the cartilage 
and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function. </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis in adults and children </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin 
covered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, 
become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be 
caused by a problem with the body s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin 
cells. </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Imraldi is also used to treat 
severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents weighing 30 kg or greater for whom topical 
therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. </p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful 
inflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that 
may leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the 
armpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Imraldi 
can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with 
the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you 
will be given Imraldi. </p>
<p>Crohn s disease in adults and children </p>
<p>Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat Crohn s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn s 
disease you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will 
be given Imraldi to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn s disease. </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis in adults and children </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. 
If you have ulcerative colitis you may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work 
well enough, you will be given Imraldi to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis in adults and children </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  </p>
<p>Imraldi is used to treat  </p>
<p>Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye </p>
<p>Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting 
the front of the eye </p>
<p>This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black 
dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Imraldi works by reducing this inflammation. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see  Warnings and precautions ). It is 
important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, 
feeling tired, dental problems.<br />
- If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Imraldi. </p>
<p>Allergic reaction </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash do not inject more Imraldi and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare 
cases, these reactions can be life-threatening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infection </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) 
consult your doctor before starting Imraldi. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.  </li>
<li>You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Imraldi treatment. This risk may 
increase if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be serious and include 
tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, other opportunistic 
infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system) and sepsis (blood 
poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your 
doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor 
may recommend temporary discontinuation of Imraldi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tuberculosis </p>
<ul>
<li>As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Imraldi, your doctor will 
check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Imraldi. This will include a 
thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example 
chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on 
your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had 
tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. 
Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for 
tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild 
fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Travel/recurrent infection </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the 
risk of infections. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis B virus </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV 
infection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you 
for HBV. Imraldi can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare 
cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, 
reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Age over 65 years </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Imraldi. You 
and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated 
with Imraldi. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, 
wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Surgery or dental procedure </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your doctor that you are taking 
Imraldi. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Imraldi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Demyelinating disease </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around 
the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue 
to receive Imraldi. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your 
vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccine </p>
<ul>
<li>Certain vaccines contain weakened but live forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, and 
these vaccines should not be given during treatment with Imraldi. Check with your doctor 
before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the 
scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Imraldi. If you receive 
Imraldi while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up 
to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you 
tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Imraldi use during your 
pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Heart Failure </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Imraldi, your heart failure status 
must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. 
shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your 
doctor will decide if you should receive Imraldi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale </p>
<ul>
<li>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells to fight off infections or 
help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed 
very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop 
treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cancer </p>
<ul>
<li>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking Imraldi 
or other TNF  blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease 
for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects 
the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). If you take 
Imraldi the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare 
occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking Imraldi. 
Some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Imraldi. </li>
<li>In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Imraldi. 
If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after therapy or if existing marks or areas of 
damage change appearance, tell your doctor. </li>
<li>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of 
lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF<br />
blocker. If you have COPD, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor 
whether treatment with a TNF  blocker is appropriate for you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Lupus-like syndrome </p>
<ul>
<li>On rare occasions, treatment with Imraldi could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your 
doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not give Imraldi to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 
2 years. </li>
<li>Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Imraldi </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Imraldi can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents 
(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or 
pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). </p>
<p>You should not take Imraldi with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due 
to increased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its 
use for at least 5 months after the last Imraldi injection. </li>
<li>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. </li>
<li>Imraldi should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. </li>
<li>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did 
not receive adalimumab. </li>
<li>Imraldi can be used during breast-feeding. </li>
<li>If you received Imraldi during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection.  </li>
<li>It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals about your 
Imraldi use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information 
on vaccines see the  Warnings and precautions  section). </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Imraldi may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning 
sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Imraldi. </p>
<p>Imraldi contains sodium and sorbitol </p>
<p>Sorbitol 
This medicinal product contains 20 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe. If you have been told by 
your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this 
medicinal product. </p>
<p>Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
