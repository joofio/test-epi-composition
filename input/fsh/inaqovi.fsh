Inaqovi is a cancer medicine. It contains the active substances decitabine and cedazuridine. </p>
<p>What Inaqovi is used for 
Inaqovi is used alone to treat acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adults, when chemotherapy is not 
considered suitable. You will be given Inaqovi when you are first diagnosed with AML. </p>
<p>AML is a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called myeloid cells. In AML, myeloid cells multiply 
and grow very quickly in bone marrow and blood. </p>
<p>How Inaqovi works 
Inaqovi contains two active substances that work in different ways. Decitabine works by stopping cancer 
cells from growing. It also kills cancer cells. Cedazuridine does not affect the cancer cells directly, but it 
inhibits the break down of decitabine. This increases the amount of decitabine that is available in the body, 
and so helps to increase the effects of decitabine.  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Inaqovi<br />
- if you are allergic to decitabine or cedazuridine, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- If you are breast-feeding (see section 2, Breast-feeding).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Inaqovi if you: 
- have lung problems<br />
- have liver problems<br />
- have kidney problems<br />
- have heart problems </p>
<p>Myelosuppression and ‘differentiation syndrome’ 
Inaqovi can cause serious myelosuppression (a condition in which the bone marrow cannot make enough 
blood cells), or a serious immune reaction called ‘differentiation syndrome’. Both may be fatal.<br />
Seek urgent medical attention if you notice any signs and symptoms (for symptoms see section 4) </p>
<p>Cardiovascular disease 
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of heart problems so that you can be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of heart failure. </p>
<p>Blood tests 
You will have blood tests while on treatment. These will occur before you start treatment with Inaqovi, at 
the start of each treatment cycle or if you notice any signs and symptoms of myelosuppression. These tests 
are to check that: 
- you have enough blood cells, and 
- your liver and kidneys are working properly </p>
<p>Your doctor may change or delay your dose of Inaqovi. Your doctor may also give you medicines to help 
prevent infections. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents under 18 years of age must not be given Inaqovi. This medicine has not been 
studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Inaqovi 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines before you begin treatment with Inaqovi. Inaqovi may affect the way some medicines work, 
especially if you are also taking the following medicines to treat:<br />
- cancer, such as cytarabine, gemcitabine or azacitidine </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice 
before taking this medicine. 
You should not take Inaqovi during pregnancy as it may harm your unborn baby. If you are able to 
become pregnant, a pregnancy test is recommended before starting treatment with Inaqovi. </p>
<p>Contraception 
Women who are able to become pregnant must use effective contraception both during treatment with 
Inaqovi, and for 6 months after taking the last dose of Inaqovi.  </p>
<p>Men with female partners who are able to become pregnant must use effective contraception both during 
treatment with Inaqovi, and for 3 months after the last dose. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the most effective methods of contraception. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Inaqovi. This is because it is not known if Inaqovi passes into 
breast milk and whether this could harm your baby. </p>
<p>Male and female fertility 
Inaqovi may affect fertility. It is not known if the effect on fertility is permanent. Talk with your doctor 
before taking this medicine if you have any concerns, or if you wish to conserve your sperm or freeze your 
eggs before starting treatment.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Inaqovi may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel tired or dizzy after taking 
Inaqovi, do not drive or use tools or machinery until you feel better. </p>
<p>Inaqovi contains lactose and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. </p>         </div>"""

<li>Swallow your tablets whole, with water, at approximately the same time each day.  </li>

taken without food. Take Inaqovi 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will usually take Inaqovi for at least 4 cycles. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check on how 
well you respond to the treatment. Your doctor may delay your dose and change the total number of 
cycles, depending on how you respond to the treatment. </p>
<p>If you vomit 
If you vomit after taking a dose, do not take an additional dose that day. Take the next dose at the usual 
time the following day. </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe you additional medicine to take before each Inaqovi dose to avoid you feeling 
sick or having to vomit during the treatment. </p>
<p>If you take more Inaqovi than you should 
Overdose can result in myelosuppression, sepsis or pneumonia (see section 4, Possible side effects). If you 
take more Inaqovi than you should, seek urgent medical attention. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Inaqovi 
If you miss a dose within 12 hours of the time you usually need to take it, you should take the missed dose 
as soon as possible and resume the normal daily dosing schedule.  </p>

usual time. Extend the dosing period by one day for every missed dose. Please ensure that you complete a 
total of 5 daily doses for each cycle. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Inaqovi

cancer may reoccur. Therefore, you should only stop taking this medicine if your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on how to take this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
