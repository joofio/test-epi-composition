  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Incresync is
Incresync contains two different medicines called alogliptin and pioglitazone in one tablet:
-
alogliptin belongs to a group of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors). Alogliptin works to increase the levels of insulin in the body after a meal and 
decrease the amount of sugar in the body. 
-
pioglitazone belongs to a group of medicines called thiazolidinediones. It helps your body make 
better use of the insulin it produces.
Both of these groups of medicines are  oral anti-diabetics .
What Incresync is used for
Incresync is used to lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is also 
called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM.
Incresync is taken when your blood sugar cannot be adequately controlled by diet, exercise and other 
oral anti-diabetic medicines such as pioglitazone; or pioglitazone and metformin taken together. Your 
doctor will check whether Incresync is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it.
If you are already taking both alogliptin and pioglitazone as single tablets, Incresync can replace them 
in one tablet.
It is important that you continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise that your nurse or doctor has 
given you.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to alogliptin, pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).
-
if you have had a serious allergic reaction to any other similar medicines that you take to control 
your blood sugar. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include; rash, raised red patches 
on your skin (hives), swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in 
breathing or swallowing. Additional symptoms may include general itching and feeling of heat 
especially affecting the scalp, mouth, throat, palms of hands and soles of feet (Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome).
-
if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past.
-
if you have liver disease.
-
if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication of poorly controlled diabetes). 
Symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting and 
rapid weight loss.
-
if you have or have ever had bladder cancer.
-
if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. Do not take Incresync and get 
your doctor to check your urine as soon as possible. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Incresync:
-
if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce insulin).
-
if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as sulphonylurea (e.g. glipizide, tolbutamide, 
glibenclamide) or insulin. 
-
if you suffer from heart disease or fluid retention. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines 
which can also cause fluid retention and swelling, you must also tell your doctor.
-
if you are elderly and are taking insulin, because you may have an increased risk of heart 
problems.
-
if you have a problem with your liver or kidneys. Before you start taking this medicine you will 
have a blood sample taken to check your liver and kidney function. This check may be repeated 
at intervals. In case of kidney disease, your doctor may reduce the dose of Incresync.
-
if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back 
of the eye).
-
if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovarian syndrome). There may be an increased 
possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Incresync. If 
this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned 
pregnancy.
-
if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.
Slight changes in cell counts may show up in blood tests. Your doctor may discuss the results with 
you. 
A higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your 
doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes.
Contact your doctor if you encounter blistering of the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called 
bullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to stop alogliptin.
Children and adolescents
Incresync is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data in 
these patients. 
Other medicines and Incresync
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:
-
gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol)
-
rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) 
Your blood sugar will be checked and your dose of Incresync may need to be changed.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
There is no experience of using Incresync in pregnant women or during breast-feeding. Incresync 
should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines
You may experience visual disturbances while taking this medicine. If this happens, do not drive or 
use any tools or machines. Taking Incresync in combination with other anti-diabetic medicines can 
cause low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use 
machines.
Incresync contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking Incresync.
Incresync contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""
