morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which is produced naturally by the body and helps with the 
formation of new bone tissue. </p>
<p>InductOs may be used either in lower back spine fusion surgery or to repair fractures of the shin bone.   </p>
<p>Lower back spine fusion surgery 
If you have a lot of pain from a damaged disc in your lower back, and other treatments have not 
proven effective, you may be considered for lower back spine fusion surgery. InductOs is used instead 
of taking a bone graft from your hip; this avoids the problems and pain that can be caused by an 
operation to collect the bone graft. </p>
<p>When used in lower back fusion surgery, InductOs is used in combination with a medical device, 
which corrects the position of your spine. If you have any question about the medical device, please 
ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Fractures of the shin bone 
If you have broken your shin bone, InductOs is used, to help your fracture heal and to reduce the need 
for additional surgeries. It is used in addition to standard treatment and care of shin bone fractures. </p>         </div>"""

medicine (listed in section 6). 
* if you are still growing (skeletally immature). 
* if you have an active infection at the surgery site. 
* if the doctor treating you decides that you have inadequate blood supply at the fracture site. 
* for treating a fracture that is disease-related (e.g., fractures due to Paget s disease or cancer).

<p>Warnings and precautions to be discussed with your doctor 
* You should inform your doctor if you have an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sj gren's syndrome or 
dermatomyositis/polymyositis.<br />
<em> You should inform your doctor if you have any bone disease. 
* You should inform your doctor of any history of cancer. 
* The product should not be placed in direct contact with certain types of bones. Your surgeon 
will know which bones to avoid. <br />
</em> Use of InductOs may cause bone formation (heterotopic ossification) in the surrounding tissues, 
which can result in complications.<br />
<em> Some patients may develop nerve pain due to localised fluid collection, which would require 
drainage or a surgical procedure to remove the fluid. 
* Some patients may develop antibodies (made by your body to fight a foreign protein) to 
InductOs.  While no harmful effects have been noted, the long-term effects are unknown.<br />
</em> You should inform your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease. 
* Localised swelling, in some cases resulting in breathing difficulty, has been reported in patients 
when InductOs has been used in surgery of the upper (neck) region of the spine. The safety and 
effectiveness of InductOs in spine surgery in the neck have not been established, and InductOs 
should not be used in this situation. </p>
<p>Other medicines and InductOs<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The effects of InductOs on pregnancy are not known. The use of the product in pregnant women is not 
advised.  </p>
<p>It is not known if InductOs passes into breast milk.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before receiving this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
InductOs will not affect your ability to drive or operate machines. </p>
<p>InductOs contains bovine collagen, a protein obtained from cattle 
Some patients may develop antibodies (made by your body to fight a foreign protein) against the 
collagen in the medicine. In clinical studies, the presence of antibodies to collagen was not associated 
with side effects, such as allergies, nor was it shown to decrease the effectiveness of InductOs. If you 
think you have an allergic reaction to collagen, contact your doctor. </p>
<p>InductOs contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per maximum dose (two 12 mg packs), i.e. it 
is essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

soak the sponge. The soaked sponge is then implanted where bone growth is needed. Over time, the 
sponge will gradually disappear as new bone is formed. </p>
<p>If you are receiving InductOs for lower back spine fusion, your surgeon will remove the damaged disc 
that is causing the pain and replace it with a medical device filled with InductOs. The medical device 
corrects the position of your spine, and InductOs encourages bone to grow between the two vertebrae 
to fix them permanently in the correct position.  </p>
<p>If you are receiving InductOs for a broken shin bone, your doctor will place InductOs around your 
broken bone when your fracture is treated.  The doctor will determine how much InductOs you will 
receive, depending on the size and number of fractures.  Generally, one 12 mg pack is used; however, 
a maximum of two 12 mg packs may be used. </p>         </div>"""
