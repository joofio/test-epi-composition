  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Infanrix hexa is a vaccine used to protect your child against six diseases:  </p>
<p>Diphtheria: a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. The 
airways become swollen causing serious breathing problems and sometimes suffocation. The 
bacteria also release a poison. This can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. </p>
<p>Tetanus: tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that 
are more likely to get tetanus infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds that have soil, 
dust, horse manure or wood splinters in them. The bacteria release a poison. This can cause muscle 
stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death. The muscle spasms can be strong enough to 
cause bone fractures of the spine. </p>
<p>Whooping cough (Pertussis): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It causes severe 
coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a  whooping  sound. 
The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can also cause ear infections, 
chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung infections (pneumonia), fits, brain 
damage and even death.  </p>
<p>Hepatitis B: is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It makes the liver swollen. The virus is found in body 
fluids such as in the vagina, blood, semen or spit (saliva) of infected people. </p>
<p>Polio: a viral infection. Polio is often only a mild illness. However, sometimes it can be very serious 
and cause permanent damage or even death. Polio can make the muscles unable to move (paralysis). 
This includes the muscles needed for breathing and walking. The arms or legs affected by the disease 
may be painfully twisted (deformed). </p>
<p>Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib):  can cause brain swelling (inflammation). This can lead to 
serious problems such as mental slowness (retardation), cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial 
blindness. It can also cause swelling of the throat. This can cause death by suffocation. Less 
commonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, heart, lungs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes 
and mouth. </p>
<p>How Infanrix hexa works 
  Infanrix hexa helps your child s body make its own protection (antibodies). This will protect your 
child against these diseases. 
  As with all vaccines, Infanrix hexa may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated. 
  The vaccine cannot cause the diseases that it protects your child from. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>Infanrix hexa or any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).  </li>
<li>formaldehyde. </li>
<li>neomycin or polymyxin (antibiotics). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin, rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face 
or tongue. 
  if your child has had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, 
hepatitis B, polio or Haemophilus influenzae type b. 
  if your child has had problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination with a 
vaccine against whooping cough 
  if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 C).<br />
A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infanrix hexa should not be given if any of the above apply to your child. If you are not sure, talk to 
your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa: </p>
<p>if after previously having Infanrix hexa or another vaccine against whooping cough, your child had 
any problems, especially:</p>
<ul>
<li>a high temperature (over 40 C) within 48 hours of vaccination </li>
<li>a collapse or  shock-like  state within 48 hours of vaccination </li>
<li>persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination </li>
<li>fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination 
  if your child has an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or epilepsy which is not 
controlled. After control of the disease the vaccine can be given. 
  if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily 
  if your child tends to have fits when they have a fever, or if there is a history of this in the family. 
  if your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the vaccination, please 
contact your doctor immediately. See also section 4 Possible side effects.<br />
  if your baby was born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal 
between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. These babies may require respiratory 
monitoring for 48-72h following the administration of the first two or three doses of Infanrix hexa. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above apply to your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before 
your child is given Infanrix hexa. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Infanrix hexa 
Your doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before 
or immediately after Infanrix hexa is given. This can help to lower some of the side effects (febrile 
reactions) of Infanrix hexa. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken, might take any other medicines 
or has recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Infanrix hexa contains neomycin, polymyxin, para-aminobenzoic acid, phenylalanine, sodium and 
potassium 
This vaccine contains neomycin and polymyxin (antibiotics). Tell your doctor if your child has had an 
allergic reaction to these ingredients.<br />
Infanrix hexa contains para-aminobenzoic acid. It may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed), and 
exceptionally, bronchospasm. 
The vaccine contains 0.0298 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the 
body cannot remove it properly. 
The vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . 
The vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially  potassium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Very common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): sleepiness, loss of 
appetite, high temperature of 38 C or higher, swelling, pain, redness where the injection was given, 
unusual crying, feeling irritable or restless. </p>
<p>Common (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), 
high temperature of more than 39.5 C, swelling larger than 5 cm or hard lump where the injection was 
given, feeling nervous. </p>
<p>Uncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): upper respiratory tract 
infection, tiredness, cough, large swelling at the injected limb. </p>
<p>Rare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): bronchitis, rash, swollen glands in 
the neck, armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal 
(thrombocytopenia), in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps 
than normal between breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination, temporarily stopping breathing 
(apnoea), swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or 
breathing (angioedema), swelling of the whole injected limb, blisters. </p>
<p>Very rare (these may happen with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine): itching (dermatitis). </p>
<p>Experience with hepatitis B vaccine </p>
<p>In extremely rare cases the following side effects have been reported with hepatitis B vaccine: paralysis, 
numbness or weakness of the arms and legs (neuropathy), inflammation of some nerves, possibly with 
pins and needles or loss of feeling or normal movement (Guillain-Barr  syndrome), swelling or 
infection of the brain (encephalopathy, encephalitis), infection around the brain (meningitis).<br />
The causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established. 
Bleeding or bruising more easily than normal (thrombocytopenia) has been reported with hepatitis B 
vaccines. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
