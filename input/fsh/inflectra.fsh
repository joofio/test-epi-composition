  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Inflectra contains the active substance infliximab, which is of human and mouse origin. Infliximab is a 
monoclonal antibody - a type of protein that attaches to a specific target in the body called TNF 
(tumour necrosis factor) alpha.
Inflectra belongs to a group of medicines called  TNF blockers . It is used in adults for the following 
inflammatory diseases:</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis</p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew s disease)</p>
<p>Psoriasis.
Inflectra is also used in adults and children 6 years of age or older for:</p>
<p>Crohn s disease</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis.
Inflectra works by selectively attaching to TNF alpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) and blocking its 
action. TNF alpha is involved in inflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the 
inflammation in your body.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. If you have active rheumatoid arthritis 
you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given 
Inflectra which you will take in combination with another medicine called methotrexate to:</p>
<p>reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease,</p>
<p>slow down the damage in your joints,</p>
<p>improve your physical function.
Psoriatic arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you 
have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work 
well enough, you will be given Inflectra to:</p>
<p>reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease,</p>
<p>slow down the damage in your joints,</p>
<p>improve your physical function.
Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew s disease)
Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine. If you have ankylosing spondylitis 
you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given 
Inflectra to:</p>
<p>reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease,</p>
<p>improve your physical function.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, you 
will first be given other medicines or treatments, such as phototherapy. If these medicines or 
treatments do not work well enough, you will be given Inflectra to reduce the signs and symptoms of 
your disease.
Ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first 
be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Inflectra to 
treat your disease.
Crohn s disease
Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn s disease you will first be 
given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Inflectra to:</p>
<p>treat active Crohn s disease,</p>
<p>reduce the number of abnormal openings (fistulae) between your bowel and your skin that have 
not been controlled by other medicines or surgery.</p>         </div>"""

<p>you are allergic to infliximab or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6),</p>
<p>you are allergic (hypersensitive) to proteins that come from mice,</p>
<p>you have tuberculosis (TB) or another serious infection such as pneumonia or sepsis(serious 
bacterial infection of the blood),</p>
<p>you have heart failure that is moderate or severe.
Do not use Inflectra if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
you are given Inflectra.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before or during treatment with Inflectra if you have:
Had treatment with any medicine containing infliximab before</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have had treatment with medicines containing infliximab in the past and 
are now starting Inflectra treatment again.</p>
<p>If you have had a break in your treatment with infliximab of more than 16 weeks, there is a 
higher risk for allergic reactions when you start the treatment again.
Infections</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Inflectra if you have an infection, even if it is a very 
minor one.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Inflectra if you have ever lived in or travelled to an area 
where infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are common. 
These infections are caused by specific types of fungi that can affect the lungs or other parts of 
your body.</p>
<p>You may get infections more easily when you are being treated with Inflectra. If you are 
65 years of age or older, you have a greater risk.</p>
<p>These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi,
bacteria or other organisms in the environment and sepsis that may be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of infection during treatment with Inflectra. Signs 
include fever, cough, flu-like signs, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, wounds or dental problems. 
Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Inflectra.
Tuberculosis (TB)</p>
<p>It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had TB or if you have been in 
close contact with someone who has had or has TB.</p>
<p>Your doctor will test you to see if you have TB. Cases of TB have been reported in patients 
treated with infliximab, even in patients who have already been treated with medicines for TB. 
Your doctor will record these tests on your patient reminder card.</p>
<p>If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicines for TB before 
you are given Inflectra.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of TB during treatment with Inflectra. Signs 
include persistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats.
Hepatitis B virus</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Inflectra if you are a carrier of hepatitis B or have ever 
had it.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B.</p>
<p>Your doctor should test you for hepatitis B virus.</p>
<p>Treatment with TNF blockers such as Inflectra may result in reactivation of hepatitis B virus in 
patients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases.</p>
<p>If you experience reactivation of hepatitis B, your doctor may need to stop your treatment and 
may give you medicines such as effective antiviral therapy with supportive treatment.
Heart problems</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure.</p>
<p>Your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during 
treatment with Inflectra. Signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet.
Cancer and lymphoma</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Inflectra if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type 
of blood cancer) or any other cancer.</p>
<p>Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at 
higher risk of developing lymphoma.</p>
<p>Children and adults taking Inflectra may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or 
another cancer.</p>
<p>Some patients who have received TNF-blockers, including infliximab have developed a rare 
type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Of these patients, most were teenage boys 
or young men and most had either Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis. This type of cancer has 
usually resulted in death. Almost all patients had also received medicines containing
azathioprine or mercaptopurine in addition to TNF-blockers.</p>
<p>Some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. If there are
any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>Some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with infliximab have developed cervical 
cancer. For women taking Inflectra including those over 60 years of age, your doctor may 
recommend regular screening for cervical cancer.
Lung disease or heavy smoking</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Inflectra if you have a lung disease called chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or if you are a heavy smoker.</p>
<p>Patients with COPD and patients who are heavy smokers may have a higher risk of developing 
cancer with Inflectra treatment.
Nervous system disease</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Inflectra if you have or have ever had a problem that 
affects your nervous system. This includes multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr  syndrome, if you 
have fits or have been diagnosed with  optic neuritis .</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of a nerve disease during treatment with 
Inflectra. Signs include changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs, numbness or 
tingling in any part of your body.
Abnormal skin openings</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have any abnormal skin openings (fistulae) before you are given 
Inflectra.
Vaccinations</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you recently have had or are due to have a vaccine.</p>
<p>You should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Inflectra treatment. You may 
receive some vaccines during treatment with Inflectra but you should not receive live vaccines 
(vaccines that contain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using Inflectra because they 
may cause infections.</p>
<p>If you received Inflectra while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk for 
getting an infection as a result of receiving a live vaccine during the first year of life. It is 
important that you tell your baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about your 
Inflectra use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine, including live 
vaccines such as the BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis).</p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, it is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other healthcare 
professionals about your Inflectra use before your baby is given any vaccine. For more 
information see section on Pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Therapeutic infectious agents</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment with a 
therapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used for the treatment of cancer).
Operations or dental procedures</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures.</p>
<p>Tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with Inflectra by showing them your 
patient reminder card.
Liver problems</p>
<p>Some patients receiving infliximab have developed serious liver problems.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with 
Inflectra. Signs include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark-brown coloured urine, pain or 
swelling in the upper right side of the stomach area, joint pain, skin rashes, or fever.
Low blood counts</p>
<p>In some patients receiving infliximab, the body may not make enough of the blood cells that 
help fight infections or help stop bleeding.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of low blood counts during treatment with 
Inflectra. Signs include persistent fever, bleeding or bruising more easily, small red or purple 
spots caused by bleeding under the skin, or looking pale.
Immune system disorder</p>
<p>Some patients receiving infliximab have developed symptoms of an immune system disorder 
called lupus.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you develop symptoms of lupus during treatment with 
Inflectra. Signs include joint pain or a rash on cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.
Children and adolescents
The information above also applies to children and adolescents. In addition:</p>
<p>Some children and teenage patients who have received TNF-blockers such as infliximab have 
developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death.</p>
<p>More children taking infliximab developed infections as compared to adults.</p>
<p>Children should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Inflectra treatment. Children 
may receive some vaccines during treatment with Inflectra but should not receive live vaccines 
while using Inflectra.
Inflectra should only be used in children if they are being treated for Crohn s disease or ulcerative 
colitis. These children must be 6 years of age or older.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor before you are given Inflectra.
Other medicines and Inflectra
Patients who have inflammatory diseases already take medicines to treat their problem. These 
medicines may cause side effects. Your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep 
using while you are having Inflectra.
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, including any 
other medicines to treat Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescription, such as 
vitamins and herbal medicines.
In particular, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following medicines:</p>
<p>Medicines that affect your immune system.</p>
<p>Kineret (which contains anakinra). Inflectra and Kineret should not be used together.</p>
<p>Orencia (which contains abatacept). Inflectra and Orencia should not be used together.
While using Inflectra you should not receive live vaccines. If you were using Inflectra during 
pregnancy or if you are receiving Inflectra while breast-feeding, tell your baby s doctor and other 
healthcare professionals caring for your baby about your Inflectra use before the baby receives any 
vaccines.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using
Inflectra.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility</p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Inflectra should only be used during 
pregnancy or while breast-feeding if your doctor feels it is necessary for you.</p>
<p>You should avoid getting pregnant when you are being treated with Inflectra and for 6 months 
after you stop being treated with it. Discuss the use of contraception during this time with your 
doctor.</p>
<p>If you received Inflectra during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. </p>
<p>It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other healthcare professionals about your 
Inflectra use before your baby is given any vaccine. If you received Inflectra while pregnant, 
giving BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) to your baby within 12 months after birth 
may result in infection with serious complications, including death. Live vaccines such as the
BCG vaccine should not be given to your baby within 12 months after birth, unless your baby s 
doctor recommends otherwise. For more information see section on vaccination.</p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, it is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other healthcare 
professionals about your Inflectra use before your baby is given any vaccine. Live vaccines 
should not be given to your baby while you are breast-feeding unless your baby s doctor 
recommends otherwise.</p>
<p>Severely decreased numbers of white blood cells have been reported in infants born to women 
treated with infliximab during pregnancy. If your baby has continual fevers or infections, 
contact your baby s doctor immediately.
Driving and using machines
Inflectra is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel tired, dizzy, or 
unwell after having Inflectra, do not drive or use any tools or machines.
Inflectra contains sodium
Inflectra contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially  sodium-free . However, 
before Inflectra is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that contains sodium. Talk to your doctor if 
you are on a low salt diet.</p>         </div>"""
