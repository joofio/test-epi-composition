2)<br />
Stopping blood clots forming in your blood. </p>
<p>Inhixa can be used to: 
 
Treat blood clots that are in your blood 
 
Stop blood clots from forming in your blood in the following situations: 
o Before and after an operation<br />
o When you have an acute illness and face period of limited mobility<br />
o If you have experienced a blood clot due to cancer to prevent further clots from forming. 
o When you have unstable angina (a condition when not enough blood gets to your heart) 
o After a heart attack

anaesthesia or lumbar puncture within 24 hours. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Inhixa should not be used interchangeably with other medicines belonging to the group of low molecular 
weight heparins. This is because they are not exactly the same and do not have the same activity and 
instructions for use. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Inhixa if: 
 
you have ever had a reaction to heparin that caused a severe drop in the number of your platelets 
 
you are going to receive spinal or epidural anesthesia or lumbar puncture (see Operations and 
Anaesthetics): a delay should be respected between Inhixa use and this procedure 
 
you have had a heart valve fitted 
 
you have endocarditis (an infection of the inner lining of the heart) 
 
you have history of gastric ulcer 
 
you have had a recent stroke<br />

 
you are elderly (over 65 years old) and especially if you are over 75 years old 
 
you have kidney problems 
 
you have liver problems 
 
you are underweight or overweight 
 
you have high level of potassium in your blood (this may be checked with a blood test) 
 
you are currently using medicines which affect bleeding (see section below – Other medicines and 
Inhixa). </p>
<p>You may have a blood test before you start using this medicine and at intervals while you are using it; this is 
to check the level of the clotting cells (platelets) and potassium in your blood. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of Inhixa has not been evaluated in children or adolescents.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Inhixa 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
 
Warfarin – another anticoagulant medicine used for thinning the blood 
 
Acetylsalicylic acid (also known as aspirin or ASA), clopidogrel or other medicines used to stop 
blood clots from forming (see also in section 3, “Changing anticoagulant medicine”) 
 
Dextran injection – used as a blood replacer 
 
Ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac or other medicines known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents 
which are used to treat pain and swelling in arthritis and other conditions 
 
Prednisolone, dexamethasone or other medicines used to treat asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and other 
conditions 
 
Medicines which increase potassium level in your blood such as potassium salts, water pills, some 
medicines for heart problems. </p>
<p>Operations and anaesthetics 
If you are going to have a spinal puncture or an operation where an epidural or spinal anaesthetic is used, tell 
your doctor that you are using Inhixa. See “Do not use Inhixa”. Also, tell your doctor if you have any 
problem with your spine or if you ever had spinal surgery. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist 
for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you are pregnant and have a mechanical heart valve, you may be at an increased risk of developing blood 
clots. Your doctor should discuss this with you. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, you should ask your doctor for advice before taking this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Inhixa does not affect the ability to drive and operate machinery. </p>
<p>Traceability 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Inhixa. So, every time you get a new package of 
Inhixa, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after Lot) and keep this 
information in a safe place. </p>
<p>Inhixa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

needle to touch anything. This is to make sure the needle stays clean (sterile). </p>
<p>6)<br />
Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the 
cleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin. </p>
<p>Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. </p>
<p>7)<br />
Hold the syringe so that the needle is pointing downwards (vertically at a 90 º angle). Insert the full 
length of the needle into the skin fold. </p>
<p>8)<br />
Press down on the plunger with your thumb. This will inject the medicine into the fatty tissue of the 
abdomen. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. </p>
<p>9)<br />
Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. Do not release the pressure on the plunger! </p>
<p>To avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site after you have injected yourself. </p>
<p>10)<br />
Firmly hold the syringe tube with one hand (A). With the other hand hold the base, “wings” of the 
syringe (B), and pull the base until you hear a clicking sound (C). Now the used needle is completely 
protected.  </p>
<p>11)<br />
Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the 
container out of reach of children. </p>
<p>When the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Do not put it in 
the household rubbish. </p>
<p>Changing anticoagulant treatment </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changing from Inhixa to blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) 
Your doctor will ask you to have performed blood tests called INR and tell you when to stop Inhixa 
accordingly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from  blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) to Inhixa<br />
Stop taking the vitamin-K antagonist. Your doctor will ask you to have performed blood tests called INR 
and tell you when to start Inhixa accordingly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from Inhixa to treatment with direct oral anticoagulant (e.g apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, 
rivaroxaban)<br />
Stop taking Inhixa. Start taking the direct oral anticoagulant 0-2 hours before the time you would have 
had the next Inhixa injection, then continue as normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from treatment with direct oral anticoagulant to Inhixa 
Stop taking direct oral anticoagulant. Do not start treatment with Inhixa until 12 hours after the final dose 
of direct oral anticoagulant. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more Inhixa than you should 
If you think that you have used too much or too little Inhixa, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist 
immediately, even if you have no signs of a problem. If a child accidentally injects or swallows Inhixa, take 
the child to a hospital casualty department straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Inhixa 
If you forget to give yourself a dose, have it as soon as you remember. Do not give yourself a double dose on 
the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. Keeping a diary will help to make sure you do not miss a dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Inhixa<br />
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
It is important for you to keep having Inhixa injections until your doctor decides to stop them. If you stop, 
you could get a blood clot which can be very dangerous. </p>         </div>"""
