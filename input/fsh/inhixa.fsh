<p>Having this medicine </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will normally give you Inhixa. This is because it needs to be given as an 
injection. </p>
<p>When you go home, you may need to continue to use Inhixa and give it yourself (see instructions 
below on how to do this). </p>
<p>Inhixa is usually given by injection underneath the skin (subcutaneous). </p>
<p>Inhixa can be given by injection into your vein (intravenous) after certain types of heart attack or 
operation. </p>
<p>Inhixa can be added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. 
Do not inject Inhixa into a muscle. </p>
<p>How much will be given to you </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how much Inhixa to give you. The dose will depend on the reason it is being 
used. </p>
<p>If you have problems with your kidneys you may be given a smaller amount of Inhixa. </p>
<ol>
<li>Treating blood clots that are in your blood </li>
</ol>
<p>The usual dose is 150 IU (1.5 mg) for every kilogram of your weight once daily or 100 IU (1 mg) for 
every kilogram of your weight twice a day. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. </p>
<ol>
<li>Stopping blood clots forming in your blood in the following situations: </li>
</ol>
<p>Operation or periods of limited mobility due to an illness </p>
<p>The dose will depend on how likely you are to develop a clot. You will be given 2,000 IU 
(20 mg) or 4,000 IU (40 mg) of Inhixa each day.  </p>
<p>If you are going to have an operation your first injection will be usually given 2 hours or 12 hours 
before your operation.  </p>
<p>If you have restricted mobility due to illness, you will normally be given 4,000 IU (40 mg) of 
Inhixa each day. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. </p>
<p>After you have had a heart attack 
Inhixa can be used for two different types of heart attack called STEMI (ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction) or non-STEMI (NSTEMI). The amount of Inhixa given to you will depend on 
your age and the kind of heart attack you have had. </p>
<p>NSTEMI type of heart attack:  </p>
<p>The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of weight every 12 hours.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will normally ask you to take acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) as well. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. </p>
<p>STEMI type of heart attack if you are under 75 years old: </p>
<p>An initial dose of 3,000 IU (30 mg) of Inhixa will be given as injection into your vein. </p>
<p>At the same time you will also be given Inhixa as an injection underneath your skin (subcutaneous 
injection). The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will normally ask you to take acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) as well. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. </p>
<p>STEMI type of heart attack if you are 75 years old or older: </p>
<p>The usual dose is 75 IU (0.75 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours. </p>
<p>The maximum amount of Inhixa given for the first two injections is 7,500 IU (75 mg).  </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. </p>
<p>For patients having a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): 
Depending on when you were last given Inhixa, your doctor may decide to give an additional dose 
of Inhixa before the PCI procedure. This is by injection into your vein. </p>
<ol>
<li>Stopping blood clots from forming in the tubes of your dialysis machine </li>
</ol>
<p>The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight. </p>
<p>Inhixa is added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. This 
amount is usually enough for a 4-hour session. However, your doctor may give you a further dose 
of 50 IU to 100 IU (0.5 to 1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, if necessary. </p>
<p>How to give yourself an injection of Inhixa with a pre-filled syringe without needle guard  </p>
<p>If you are able to give this medicine to yourself, your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this. Do not 
try to inject yourself if you have not been trained to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your doctor 
or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>Before injecting yourself with Inhixa 
- Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. 
- Check if the syringe is not damaged and the liquid inside is clear. If not, use another syringe. 
- Do not use this medicine if you notice any change in its appearance. 
- Make sure you know how much you are going to inject. 
- Check if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, oozing or is still 
painful. If so, talk to your doctor or nurse. 
- Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each time 
from the right to the left side of your abdomen (belly). This medicine should be injected just under 
the skin on your abdomen, but not too near the belly button or any scar tissue (at least 5 cm away 
from these). 
- The pre-filled syringe is intended for single use only. 
Instructions on injecting yourself with Inhixa 
1)<br />
Wash your hands and the area that you will inject with soap and water. Dry them. 
2)<br />
Sit or lie in a comfortable position so you are relaxed. Make sure you can see the place you are going 
to inject. In a lounge chair, recliner, or propped up in bed with pillows is ideal. 
3)<br />
Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 cm away from 
your belly button and out towards your sides. </p>
<p>Remember: Do not inject yourself within 5 cm of your belly button or around existing scars or bruises. 
Change the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area 
you were last injected. </p>
<p>4)<br />
Remove the plastic blister containing the pre-filled syringe from the box. Open the blister and 
remove the pre-filled syringe. 
5)<br />
Carefully pull off the needle cap from the syringe. Throw away the cap. The syringe is pre-filled and 
ready to use. </p>
<p>Do not press on the plunger before injecting yourself. Once you have removed the cap, do not allow the 
needle to touch anything. This is to make sure the needle stays clean (sterile). </p>
<p>6)<br />
Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the 
cleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin. </p>
<p>Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. </p>
<p>7)<br />
Hold the syringe so that the needle is pointing downwards (vertically at a 90  angle). Insert the full 
length of the needle into the skin fold. </p>
<p>8)<br />
Press down on the plunger with your thumb. This will inject the medicine into the fatty tissue of the 
abdomen. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. </p>
<p>9)<br />
Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. 
To avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site after you have injected yourself. </p>
<p>10)<br />
Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the 
container out of reach of children. </p>
<p>When the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Do not put it in 
the household rubbish. </p>
<p>How to give yourself an injection of Inhixa with a pre-filled syringe with needle guard </p>

Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the 
container out of reach of children. </p>
<p>When the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Do not put it in

<p>Changing anticoagulant treatment 
- Changing from Inhixa to blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) 
Your doctor will ask you to have performed blood tests called INR and tell you when to stop Inhixa 
accordingly. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changing from  blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) to Inhixa<br />
Stop taking the vitamin-K antagonist. Your doctor will ask you to have performed blood tests called INR 
and tell you when to start Inhixa accordingly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from Inhixa to treatment with direct oral anticoagulant (e.g apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, 
rivaroxaban)<br />
Stop taking Inhixa. Start taking the direct oral anticoagulant 0-2 hours before the time you would have 
had the next Inhixa injection, then continue as normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing from treatment with direct oral anticoagulant to Inhixa 
Stop taking direct oral anticoagulant. Do not start treatment with Inhixa until 12 hours after the final dose 
of direct oral anticoagulant. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use more Inhixa than you should 
If you think that you have used too much or too little Inhixa, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist 
immediately, even if you have no signs of a problem. If a child accidentally injects or swallows Inhixa, take 
the child to a hospital casualty department straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Inhixa 
If you forget to give yourself a dose, have it as soon as you remember. Do not give yourself a double dose on 
the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. Keeping a diary will help to make sure you do not miss a dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Inhixa<br />
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
It is important for you to keep having Inhixa injections until your doctor decides to stop them. If you stop, 
you could get a blood clot which can be very dangerous. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Like other anticoagulant medicines (medicines to reduce blood clotting), Inhixa may cause bleeding which 
may potentially be life-threatening. In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. </p>
<p>If you experience any bleeding that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of excessive bleeding 
(exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling), consult your doctor 
immediately. 
Your doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change your medicine. </p>
<p>Stop using Inhixa and talk to a doctor or nurse at once if you get any signs of a severe allergic reaction (such 
as difficulty breathing, swelling of the lips, mouth, throat or eyes).  </p>
<p>Stop using enoxaparin and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms: </p>
<p>A red, scaly widespread rash with bumps under the skin and blisters accompanied by fever. The 
symptoms usually appear at the initiation of treatment (acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis). </p>

<p>If you have any sign of blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>cramping pain, redness, warmth, or swelling in one of your legs   these are symptoms of deep 
vein thrombosis </li>
<li>breathlessness, chest pain, fainting or coughing up blood   these are symptoms of a pulmonary 
embolism  </li>
