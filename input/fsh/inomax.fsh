<p>If you (as the patient) or your child (as the patient) are allergic (hypersensitive) to nitric oxide or 
any other ingredients of INOmax (see section 6  further information  where the full list of 
ingredients is provided). </p>

<li>
<p>If you have been told that you (as the patient) or your child (as the patient) have an abnormal 
circulation within the heart.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Inhaled nitric oxide may not always be effective and thus other therapies may be considered necessary 
for you or your child. </p>
<p>Inhaled nitric oxide may influence the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. This will be monitored 
by blood samples and if required the dose of inhaled nitric oxide must be reduced. </p>
<p>Nitric oxide may react with oxygen forming nitrogen dioxide that may cause airway irritation. Your or 
your child s doctor will undertake monitoring of nitrogen dioxide and in case of elevated values the 
INOmax therapy will be adjusted, decreased accordingly. </p>
<p>Inhaled nitric oxide may have a mild but influence on the platelets (components that help the blood to 
clot) of you or your child and any signs of bleeding and or haematoma should be observed. If you see 
any signs or symptoms that may be associated to bleeding, you should directly inform the doctor. </p>
<p>No effect of inhaled nitric oxide has been documented in newborn babies with a malformation where 
the diaphragm is not fully complete, so called  congenital diaphragmatic hernia . </p>
<p>In newborn babies with special malformations of the heart,  what doctors calls congenital heart 
defects  inhaled nitric oxide may cause a worsening of the circulation.  </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>INOmax should not be used in preterm baby &lt; 34 weeks of gestational age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and INOmax </p>
<p>The doctor will decide when to treat you or your child with INOmax and with other medicines and 
will carefully supervise the treatment. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you (as the patient) or your child (as the patient) are taking or have recently 
taken or used any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Some medicines can affect the ability of blood to carry oxygen. These include prilocaine (a local 
anaesthetic used for pain relief in association to minor painful procedures e.g. suturing, and minor 
surgical or diagnostic procedures) or glyceryl trinitrate (used to treat chest pain). Your doctor will take 
care to check that the blood can carry enough oxygen when you are taking these medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding </p>
<p>INOmax is not recommended for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. 
Tell your doctor before treatment with INOmax if you are pregnant, think you could be pregnant or are 
breastfeeding </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Your doctor will decide the correct dose of INOmax and will administer INOmax to you or your 
child s lungs through a system designed for delivering this gas. This delivery system will ensure that 
the correct amount of nitric oxide is delivered by diluting INOmax with an oxygen/air mixture 
immediately before giving it to you.  </p>
<p>For you or your child s safety, the delivery systems intended for administration of INOmax are fitted 
with devices that constantly measure the amount of nitric oxide, oxygen, and nitrogen dioxide (a 
chemical formed when nitric oxide and oxygen are mixed) being delivered to the lungs.   </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how long you or your child should be treated with INOmax. </p>
<p>INOmax is given in dose of 10 to 20 ppm, (maximal dose 20 ppm in children and 40 ppm in adults) 
part per million of the gas that you or your child inhale. The lowest effective dose will be sought. 
Therapy is usually required for about 4 days in newborn infants with lung failure associated with high 
blood pressure in the lungs. In children and adults with high blood pressure in the lungs, connected 
with heart surgery, INOmax is usually given for 24-48 hours. However, therapy with INOmax may 
last longer. </p>
<p>If you or your child receive more INOmax than you should </p>
<p>Too much of inhaled nitric oxide may influence the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. This will 
be monitored by blood samples and if required the INOmax dose will be decreased and the 
administration of medicines such as vitamin C, methylene blue, or eventually blood transfusion, in 
order to improve the oxygen carrying capacity, may be considered. </p>
<p>If you stop using INOmax </p>
<p>Treatment with INOmax should not be stopped suddenly. Low blood pressure or a rebound increase in 
pressure in the lungs has been known to occur if treatment with INOmax is stopped suddenly without 
first lowering the dose. </p>
<p>At the end of treatment, the doctor will slowly lower the amount of INOmax being given to you or 
your child, so that the circulation in the lungs is able to adjust to oxygen/air without INOmax. Thus, it 
may take a day or two before you or your child is off INOmax therapy. </p>

<p>Side effects that are very commonly seen (affects more than 1 user in 10) in association with INOmax 
therapy include: 
* Low platelet count.  </p>

<p>Side effects that may be seen, but uncommonly (affects between 1 user in 100 and 1 user in 1000) are: 
* increase in methaemoglobin, thus reduced oxygen carrying capacity.  </p>
<p>Side effects that may be seen but the frequency is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available data) are:<br />
<em> Bradycardia (low cardiac frequency) or too low amount of oxygen in the blood (oxygen 
desaturation/hypoxemia) due to sudden withdrawal of the treatment,<br />
</em> Headache, dizziness, dry throat, or shortness of breath following accidental ambient air 
exposure to nitric oxide (e.g. leakage from equipment or cylinder).  </p>
<p>You should directly inform the personnel if you experience headache while being in close proximity to 
your child receiving INOmax.  </p>
<p>If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, even 
after you or your child leave the hospital, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly the national reporting system
