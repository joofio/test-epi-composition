Inrebic contains the active substance fedratinib. It is a type of medicine known as  protein kinase 
inhibitors . </p>
<p>What Inrebic is used for 
Inrebic is used to treat adult patients with an enlarged spleen or with symptoms related to 
myelofibrosis, a rare form of blood cancer. </p>
<p>How Inrebic works 
An enlarged spleen is one of the characteristics of myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a disorder of the 
bone marrow, in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue. The abnormal marrow can no longer 
produce enough normal blood cells and as a result the spleen becomes significantly enlarged. By 
blocking the action of certain enzymes (called Janus Associated Kinases), Inrebic can reduce the size 
of the spleen in patients with myelofibrosis and relieve symptoms such as fever, night sweats, bone 
pain and weight loss in patients with myelofibrosis. </p>         </div>"""
