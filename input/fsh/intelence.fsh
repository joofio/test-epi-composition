medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).
INTELENCE is a medicine used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
infection. INTELENCE works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your 
immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.
INTELENCE is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to treat adults and children 
2 years of age and older who are infected by HIV and who have used other anti-HIV medicines before.
Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.</p>         </div>"""

if you are taking elbasvir/grazoprevir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking INTELENCE.
INTELENCE is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in 
the blood.
Elderly
INTELENCE has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to 
this age group, please discuss the use of INTELENCE with your doctor.
Weight and increased blood lipids and glucose
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Bone problems
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.
-
Tell your doctor if you develop a rash. If a rash occurs, it usually appears soon after anti-HIV 
treatment with INTELENCE is started and often disappears within 1 to 2 weeks, even with 
continued use of the medicine. Rarely, during INTELENCE treatment, you can experience 
severe skin rash with blisters or peeling skin, particularly around the mouth or eyes or 
hypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction including rash and fever but also swelling of the face, 
tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing) which could be potentially 
life-threatening. Please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. 
Your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms and whether INTELENCE must 
be stopped. If you have stopped treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, you should not 
restart therapy with INTELENCE.
-
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or 
C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take 
INTELENCE.
-
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections. In some patients with 
advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of 
inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is 
believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
-
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children less than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kg because the 
potential benefits and risks have not been established.
Other medicines and INTELENCE
INTELENCE might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, 
have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.
In most cases, INTELENCE can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class.
However, some combinations are not recommended. In other cases, increased monitoring and/or a 
change in the dose of the medicine may be needed. Therefore, always tell your doctor which other 
anti-HIV medicines you take. Furthermore, it is important that you carefully read the package leaflets 
that are provided with these medicines. Follow your doctor s instruction carefully on which medicines 
can be combined.
It is not recommended to combine INTELENCE with any of the following medicines:
-
tipranavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine, indinavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, 
darunavir/cobicistat (anti-HIV medicine)
-
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to prevent seizures)
-
rifampicin, because it is contraindicated with boosted protease inhibitors, and rifapentine 
(medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)
-
products that contain St John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for 
depression)
-
daclatasvir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).
If you are taking any of these, ask your doctor for advice.
The effects of INTELENCE or other medicines might be influenced if you take INTELENCE 
together with any of the following medicines. The dosages of some medicines might need to be 
changed since their therapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined with 
INTELENCE. Tell your doctor if you take:
-
dolutegravir, maraviroc, amprevanir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (anti-HIV medicine)
-
amiodarone, bepridil, digoxin, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone and 
quinidine (medicines to treat certain heart disorders, e.g., abnormal heart beat)
-
warfarin (a medicine used to reduce clotting of the blood). Your doctor will have to check your 
blood
-
fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (medicines to treat fungal 
infections)
-
clarithromycin, rifabutin (antibiotics)
-
artemether/lumefantrine (a medicine to treat malaria)
-
diazepam (medicines to treat trouble with sleeping and/or anxiety)
-
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions)
-
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (cholesterol-lowering medicines)
-
cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus (immunosuppressants   medicines used to dampen down 
your immune system)
-
sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines to treat erectile dysfunction and/or pulmonary arterial
hypertension)
-
clopidogrel (a medicine to prevent blood clots).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant. Pregnant women should not take INTELENCE 
unless specifically directed by the doctor.
Because of the potential for side effects in breast-fed infants, it is recommended that women not 
breast-feed if they are receiving INTELENCE. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should 
discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or operate machines if you feel sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicines.
INTELENCE contains lactose
INTELENCE tablets contain lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars (lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
INTELENCE contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free .</p>         </div>"""

Use in adults
Other form(s) of this medicine may be more suitable for adults.
The recommended dose of INTELENCE is 200 mg twice a day.
In the morning, take two 100 milligram INTELENCE tablets, following a meal.
In the evening, take two 100 milligram INTELENCE tablets, following a meal.
Use in children and adolescents 2 years of age and older and weighing at least 10 kg
The doctor will work out the right dose based on the weight of the child.
The doctor will inform you exactly how much INTELENCE the child should take.
Instructions for taking INTELENCE for all patients
It is important that you take INTELENCE following a meal. If you take INTELENCE on an empty 
stomach, only half the amount of INTELENCE is absorbed. Follow your doctor s advice on the type 
of meal you should be taking with INTELENCE.
Swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not chew the tablet(s). The tablet 
can be divided into two equal doses.
If you are unable to swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole, you may do the following:
-
place the tablet(s) in 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water, or at least enough liquid to cover the 
medicine,
-
stir well for about 1 minute until the water looks milky,
-
if desired, add up to 30 ml (2 tablespoons) more of water or alternatively orange juice or 
milk (do not place the tablets directly in orange juice or milk),
-
drink it immediately,
-
rinse the glass several times with water, orange juice, or milk and completely swallow the 
rinse each time to make sure you take the entire dose.
If you mix INTELENCE tablet(s) with a liquid, take this first, before other liquid anti-HIV medicines 
that you need to take at the same time.
Contact your doctor if you are not able to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid.
If your child needs to take INTELENCE tablet(s) mixed with a liquid, it is very important that he/she 
takes the entire dose so that the right amount of medicine enters into the body. If the full dose is not 
taken, the risk of the virus developing resistance is higher. Contact your doctor if your child is not able 
to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid, as they may consider giving another medicine to 
treat your child.
Do not use warm (40 C and above) or carbonated beverages when taking INTELENCE tablet(s).
Removing the child resistant cap
The plastic bottle comes with a child resistant cap and should be opened as 
follows:
-
Push the plastic screw cap down while turning it counter clockwise.
-
Remove the unscrewed cap.
If you take more INTELENCE than you should
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. The most frequent side effects of INTELENCE are 
rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and headache (see section  4. Possible side effects ).
If you forget to take INTELENCE
If you notice within 6 hours of the time you usually take INTELENCE, you must take the tablet(s)
as soon as possible. Always take the tablet(s) following a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. If 
you notice after 6 hours, then skip the intake and take the next doses as usual. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you vomit less than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, take another dose following a meal. If you 
vomit more than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, then you do not need to take another dose until 
your regularly scheduled dose.
Contact your doctor if you are uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.
Do not stop taking INTELENCE without talking to your doctor first
HIV therapy may increase your sense of well-being. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking 
INTELENCE or your other anti-HIV medicines. Doing so could increase the risk of the virus 
developing resistance. Talk to your doctor first.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
