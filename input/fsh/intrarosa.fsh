<p>What Intrarosa is used for </p>
<p>Intrarosa is used to treat postmenopausal women having moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and 
vaginal atrophy. It is used to relieve menopausal symptoms in the vagina such as dryness or irritation. 
It is caused by a drop in the levels of oestrogen in your body. This happens naturally after the 
menopause. </p>
<p>How Intrarosa works </p>
<p>Prasterone corrects the symptoms and signs of vulvar and vaginal atrophy by replacing the oestrogens 
which are normally produced before menopause by the ovaries of women. It is inserted into your vagina, 
so the hormone is released where it is needed. This may relieve discomfort in the vagina. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>The use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) carries risks which need to be considered when 
deciding whether to start taking it, or whether to carry on taking it.  </p>
<p>The experience in treating women with a premature menopause (due to ovarian failure or surgery) is 
limited. If you have a premature menopause the risks of using HRT may be different. Please talk to 
your doctor.  </p>
<p>Before you start (or restart) HRT, your doctor will ask about your own and your family s medical 
history. Your doctor may decide to perform a physical examination. This may include an examination 
of your breasts and/or an internal examination, if necessary.  </p>
<p>Once you have started using Intrarosa you should see your doctor for regular check-ups (at least every 
6 months). At these check-ups, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of continuing with 
Intrarosa. </p>
<p>Go for regular breast screening, as recommended by your doctor. </p>
<p>Do not use Intrarosa 
if any of the following applies to you. If you are not sure about any of the points below, talk to your 
doctor before taking Intrarosa, 
* If you have or have ever had breast cancer, or if you are suspected of having it; 
* If you have cancer which is sensitive to oestrogens, such as cancer of the womb lining 
(endometrium), or if you are suspected of having it; 
* If you have any unexplained vaginal bleeding; 
* If you have excessive thickening of the womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia ) that is not 
being treated; 
* If you have or have ever had a blood clot in a vein (thrombosis), such as in the legs (deep 
venous thrombosis) or the lungs (pulmonary embolism); 
* If you have a blood clotting disorder (such as protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency); 
* If you have or recently have had a disease caused by blood clots in the arteries, such as a heart 
attack, stroke or angina; 
* If you have or have ever had a liver disease and your liver function tests have not returned to 
normal; 
* If you have a rare blood problem called  porphyria  which is passed down in families 
(inherited); 
* If you are allergic to prasterone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6  Contents of the pack and other information ). </p>
<p>If any of the above conditions appears for the first time while taking Intrarosa, stop taking it at once 
and consult your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>When to take special care with Intrarosa 
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any of the following problems, before you start the treatment, as 
these may return or become worse during treatment with Intrarosa. If so, you should see your doctor 
more often for check-ups: </p>
<ul>
<li>fibroids inside your womb;  </li>
<li>growth of womb lining outside your womb (endometriosis) or a history of excessive growth of 
the womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia); </li>
<li>increased risk of developing blood clots (see  Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis) );  </li>
<li>increased risk of getting a oestrogen-sensitive cancer (such as having a mother, sister or 
grandmother who has had breast cancer); </li>
<li>high blood pressure; </li>
<li>a liver disorder, such as a benign liver tumour; </li>
<li>diabetes; </li>
<li>gallstones;  </li>
<li>migraine or (severe) headaches; </li>
<li>a disease of the immune system that affects many organs of the body (systemic lupus 
erythematosus, SLE); </li>
<li>epilepsy; </li>
<li>asthma; </li>
<li>a disease affecting the eardrum and hearing (otosclerosis); </li>
<li>a very high level of fat in your blood (triglycerides); </li>
<li>fluid retention due to cardiac or kidney problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Stop using Intrarosa and see a doctor immediately<br />
If you notice any of the following conditions when taking HRT: 
* any of the conditions mentioned in the  Do not use Intrarosa  section; 
* yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice). These may be signs of a liver 
disease; 
* if you become pregnant; 
* a large rise in your blood pressure (symptoms may be headache, tiredness, dizziness); 
* migraine-like headaches which happen for the first time; 
* if you notice signs of a blood clot, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>painful swelling and redness of the legs; </li>
<li>sudden chest pain; </li>
<li>difficulty in breathing. 
For more information, see  Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Intrarosa is not a contraceptive. If it is less than 12 months since your last menstrual period or 
you are under 50 years old, you may still need to use additional contraception to prevent pregnancy. 
Speak to your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>HRT and cancer 
Intrarosa has not been studied in women with current or history of cancers.<br />
Excessive thickening of the lining of the womb (endometrial hyperplasia) and cancer of the lining 
of the womb (endometrial cancer) 
Taking oestrogen-only HRT tablets for a long time can increase the risk of developing cancer of the 
womb lining (the endometrium). Intrarosa does not stimulate the endometrium as shown by atrophy of 
the lining of the womb in all women treated with Intrarosa for one year during the clinical study. </p>
<p>It is uncertain whether a risk exists with Intrarosa used for long term (more than one year) treatments. 
However, Intrarosa has been shown to have very low absorption into the blood, therefore the addition 
of a progestagen is not necessary. </p>
<p>If you get bleeding or spotting, it s usually nothing to worry about, but you should make an 
appointment to see your doctor. It could be a sign that your endometrium has become thicker. </p>
<p>The following risks apply to HRT medicines which circulate in the blood. However Intrarosa is for 
local treatment in the vagina and the absorption into the blood is very low. It is less likely that the 
conditions mentioned below will get worse or come back during treatment with Intrarosa, but you 
should see your doctor if you are concerned. </p>
<p>Breast cancer 
Evidence suggests that taking combined oestrogen-progestogen and possibly also oestrogen-only HRT 
increases the risk of breast cancer. The extra risk depends on how long you take HRT. The additional 
risk becomes clear within a few years. However, it returns to normal within a few years (at most 5) 
after stopping treatment.  </p>
<p>Regularly check your breasts. See your doctor if you notice any changes such as: 
<em><br />
dimpling of the skin; 
</em><br />
changes in the nipple; 
*<br />
any lumps you can see or feel. </p>
<p>Additionally, you are advised to join mammography screening programs when offered to you. </p>
<p>Ovarian cancer 
Ovarian cancer is rare - much rarer than breast cancer. The use of oestrogen-only HRT has been 
associated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer.  </p>
<p>The risk of ovarian cancer varies with age. For example, in women aged 50 to 54 who are not taking 
HRT, about 2 women in 2000 will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer over a 5-year period. For women 
who have been taking HRT for 5 years, there will be about 3 cases per 2000 users (i.e. about 1 extra 
case). 
Cases of ovarian and breast cancer have rarely been reported in women treated with 6.5 mg of 
prasterone for 52 weeks. </p>
<p>Effect of HRT on heart and circulation 
Intrarosa has not been studied in women with history of thromboembolic diseases, uncontrolled 
hypertension or heart disease.  </p>
<p>Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis) 
The risk of blood clots in the veins is about 1.3 to 3-times higher in HRT users than in non-users, 
especially during the first year of taking it.  </p>
<p>Blood clots can be serious, and if one travels to the lungs, it can cause chest pain, breathlessness, 
fainting or even death.  </p>
<p>You are more likely to get a blood clot in your veins as you get older and if any of the following 
applies to you. Inform your doctor if any of these situations applies to you: 
* you are unable to walk for a long time because of major surgery, injury or illness (see also 
section 3, If you need to have surgery); 
* you are seriously overweight (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2); 
* you have any blood clotting problem that needs long-term treatment with a medicine used to 
prevent blood clots; 
* if any of your close relatives has ever had a blood clot in the leg, lung or another organ; 
* you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); 
* you have cancer. </p>
<p>For signs of a blood clot, see  Stop using Intrarosa and see a doctor immediately . 
In clinical studies, no deep vein thrombosis has been observed with intravaginal prasterone while one 
case of pulmonary embolism which corresponds to an incidence lower with Intrarosa than in the 
placebo group. </p>
<p>Compare 
Looking at women in their 50s who are not taking HRT, on average, over a 5-year period, 4 to 7 in 1would be expected to get a blood clot in a vein.  </p>
<p>Heart disease (heart attack) / Hypertension 
For women taking oestrogen-only therapy there is no increased risk of developing a heart disease. </p>
<p>Stroke 
The risk of getting stroke is about 1.5 times higher in HRT users than in non-users. The number of 
extra cases of stroke due to use of HRT will increase with age.<br />
No case of stroke has been observed with Intrarosa during clinical studies. </p>
<p>Compare 
Looking at women in their 50s who are not taking HRT, on average, 8 in 1000 would be expected to 
have a stroke over a 5-year period. For women in their 50s who are taking HRT, there will be 11 cases 
in 1000 users, over 5 years (i.e. an extra 3 cases). </p>
<p>Other conditions 
* HRT will not prevent memory loss. There is some evidence of a higher risk of memory loss in 
women who start using HRT after the age of 65. Speak to your doctor for advice; 
* You may have vaginal discharge due to melting of the  hard fat base  which adds to increased 
vaginal secretions due to treatment. If vaginal discharge occurs, it is not required to stop 
Intrarosa.<br />
* Intrarosa may weaken condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps made of latex. 
* If you have a vaginal infection you will need a course of antibiotics before taking Intrarosa. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Intrarosa is only used in adult women.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Intrarosa<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>No data on efficacy and safety are available in women currently treated with hormonal therapy such 
as: androgens, HRT (oestrogen alone or combined with progestogens).  </p>
<p>The use of Intraorsa in combination with HRT (oestrogen-only or oestrogen-progestagen combination 
or androgen treatment) or vaginal oestrogens is not recommended. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy and breast feeding </p>
<p>Intrarosa is for use in postmenopausal women only. If you become pregnant, stop using Intrarosa and 
contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>Intrarosa is not meant for women with child-bearing potential. It is not known if this medicine affects 
fertility. </p>

<p>ANNEX IV 
SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS 
OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) 
Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report for the non-interventional imposed PASS final study 
report for the medicinal product(s) mentioned above, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as 
follows: 
Intrarosa (prasterone) is removed from the additional monitoring list as the condition to the marketing 
authorisation has been fulfilled. This relates to the non-interventional PASS - Drug Utilisation Study 
(DUS) to describe the baseline characteristics, utilisation patterns of EU postmenopausal women 
initiating treatment with Intrarosa and to assess whether EU prescribers abide by the contraindications 
stated in the EU SmPC. 
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will 
allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, 
is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce a change to the list of local representatives. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for the results of the study for the medicinal product(s) 
mentioned above, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of these medicinal product(s) is
