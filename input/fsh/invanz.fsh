Treatment:
Your doctor has prescribed INVANZ because you or your child has one (or more) of the following
types of infection: </p>
<p>Infection in the abdomen</p>
<p>Infection affecting the lungs (pneumonia)</p>
<p>Gynaecological infections</p>
<p>Skin infections of the foot in diabetic patients.

- if you are allergic to the active substance (ertapenem) or any of the other ingredients of this
medicine (listed in section 6)
- if you are allergic to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins or carbapenems (which are
used to treat various infections).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before taking INVANZ.
During treatment, if you experience an allergic reaction (such as swelling of the face, tongue or throat,
difficulty in breathing or swallowing, skin rash), tell your doctor straight away as you may need urgent
medical treatment. 
While antibiotics including INVANZ kill certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may continue to
grow more than normal. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you for overgrowth and
treat you if necessary.
It is important that you tell your doctor if you have diarrhoea before, during or after your treatment
with INVANZ. This is because you may have a condition known as colitis (an inflammation of the
bowel). Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor.
Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium valproate (see Other
medicines and INVANZ below).
Tell your doctor about any medical condition you have or have had including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kidney disease. It is particularly important that your doctor knows if you have kidney disease
and whether you undergo dialysis treatment.</li>
<li>Allergies to any medicines, including antibiotics.</li>
<li>Central nervous system disorders, such as localised tremors, or seizures.
Children and adolescents (3 months to 17 years of age)
Experience with INVANZ is limited in children less than two years of age. In this age group your
doctor will decide on the potential benefit of its use. There is no experience in children under 3 months
of age.
Other medicines and INVANZ
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium
valproate (used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraines, or schizophrenia). This is because
INVANZ can affect the way some other medicines work. Your doctor will decide whether you should
use INVANZ in combination with these other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
INVANZ has not been studied in pregnant women. INVANZ should not be used during pregnancy
unless your doctor decides the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Women who are receiving INVANZ should not breast-feed, because it has been found in human milk
and the breast-fed baby may therefore be affected.
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how you react to the medicine.
Certain side effects, such as dizziness and sleepiness, have been reported with INVANZ, which may
affect some patients  ability to drive or operate machinery.
INVANZ contains sodium
This medicine contains approximately 137 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in
each 1.0 g dose. This is equivalent to 6.85 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of
sodium for an adult.</li>

given once a day. The recommended dose for children 3 months to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg given
twice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day). Your doctor will decide how many days  treatment you need.
For prevention of surgical site infections following surgery of the colon or rectum, the recommended
dose of INVANZ is 1 g administered as a single intravenous dose 1 hour before surgery.
It is very important that you continue to receive INVANZ for as long as your doctor prescribes it.
If you are given more INVANZ than you should
If you are concerned that you may have been given too much INVANZ, contact your doctor or another

<p>The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
Instructions of how to reconstitute and dilute INVANZ:
For single use only.
Preparation for intravenous administration:
INVANZ must be reconstituted and then diluted prior to administration.
Adult and adolescents (13 to 17 years of age)
Reconstitution
Reconstitute the contents of a 1 g vial of INVANZ with 10 mL of water for injection or sodium
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution to yield a reconstituted solution of approximately 100 mg/mL.
Shake well to dissolve.
Dilution
For a 50 mL bag of diluent: For a 1 g dose, immediately transfer contents of the reconstituted vial to a
50 mL bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution; or
For a 50 mL vial of diluent: For a 1 g dose, withdraw 10 mL from a 50 mL vial of sodium chloride
9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution and discard. Transfer the contents of the reconstituted 1 g vial of INVANZ
to the 50 mL vial of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution.
Infusion
Infuse over a period of 30 minutes.
Children (3 months to 12 years of age)
Reconstitution
Reconstitute the contents of a 1 g vial of INVANZ with 10 mL of water for injection or sodium
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution to yield a reconstituted solution of approximately 100 mg/mL.
Shake well to dissolve.
Dilution
For a bag of diluent: Transfer a volume equal to 15 mg/kg of body weight (not to exceed 1 g/day) to a
bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for a final concentration of 20 mg/mL or less; or 
For a vial of diluent: Transfer a volume equal to 15 mg/kg of body weight (not to exceed 1 g/day) to a
vial of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for a final concentration of 20 mg/mL or less.
Infusion
Infuse over a period of 30 minutes.
The reconstituted solution should be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution
immediately after preparation. Diluted solutions should be used immediately. If not used immediately,
in use storage times are the responsibility of the user. Diluted solutions (approximately 20 mg/mL
ertapenem) are physically and chemically stable for 6 hours at room temperature (25 C) or for
24 hours at 2 to 8 C (in a refrigerator). Solutions should be used within 4 hours of their removal from
the refrigerator. Do not freeze the reconstituted solutions.
The reconstituted solutions should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior
to administration, whenever the container permits. Solutions of INVANZ range from colourless to
pale yellow. Variations of colour within this range do not affect potency.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.</p>         </div>"""
