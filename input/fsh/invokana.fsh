  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Invokana contains the active substance canagliflozin which belongs to a group of medicines called 
 blood-glucose lowering drugs. 
Invokana is used:</p>
<p>to treat adults with type 2 diabetes.
This medicine works by increasing the amount of sugar removed from your body in your urine. This 
reduces the amount of sugar in your blood and can help prevent heart disease in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It also helps to slow down deterioration of kidney function in patients with 
T2DM by a mechanism beyond blood glucose lowering.
Invokana can be used by itself or along with other medicines you may be using to treat your type 2 
diabetes (such as metformin, insulin, a DPP-4 inhibitor [such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, or linagliptin], 
a sulphonylurea [such as glimepiride or glipizide], or pioglitazone) that lower blood sugar levels. You 
may already be taking one or more of these to treat your type 2 diabetes.
It is also important to keep following advice about diet and exercise given by your doctor or nurse.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that 
your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. 
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical conditions 
such as heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Invokana, and during treatment:</p>
<p>about what you can do to prevent dehydration (see section 4 for signs of dehydration).</p>
<p>if you have type 1 diabetes because Invokana should not be used to treat this condition.</p>
<p>if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat, talk to a 
doctor or go to the nearest hospital immediately. These symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic 
ketoacidosis    a rare but serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get with diabetes 
because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of 
developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol 
consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to 
major surgery or serious illness.</p>
<p>if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid 
weight loss, nausea, or vomiting). Invokana should not be used to treat this condition.</p>
<p>if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis.</p>
<p>if you have severe liver problems.</p>
<p>if you have ever had serious heart disease or if you have had a stroke.</p>
<p>if you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) or have ever had low 
blood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below in  Other medicines and 
Invokana .</p>
<p>if you have had a lower limb amputation.</p>
<p>It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care 
and adequate hydration given by your healthcare professional. You should notify your doctor 
immediately if you notice any wounds or discolouration, or if you experience any tenderness or 
pain in your feet. Some studies indicate that taking canagliflozin may have contributed to the 
risk of lower limb amputation (mainly toe and midfoot amputations).</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or 
feeling generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even 
life-threatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene 
which destroys the tissue under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.</p>
<p>if you have signs of a genital yeast infection such as irritation, itching, unusual discharge or 
odour.</p>
<p>if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask 
you to stop taking Invokana until you have recovered.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before 
taking this medicine.
Kidney function
Your kidneys will be tested by a blood test before you start taking and while you are on this medicine.
Urine glucose
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on 
this medicine.
Children and adolescents
Invokana is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and Invokana
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. This is because this medicine can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some 
other medicines can affect the way this medicine works.
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<p>other antidiabetics - either insulin or a sulphonylurea (such as glimepiride or glipizide)   your 
doctor may want to reduce your dose in order to avoid your blood sugar level from getting too 
low (hypoglycaemia)</p>
<p>medicines used to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives), including diuretics 
(medicines used to remove levels of excess water in the body, also known as water tablets) since 
this medicine can also lower your blood pressure by removing levels of excess water in the 
body. Possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are listed in section </p>         </div>"""

cycle, or use tools or machines.

glipizide) or insulin can increase the risk of having low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). Signs include
blurred vision, tingling lips, trembling, sweating, pale looking, a change in mood, or feeling anxious or
confused. This may affect your ability to drive, cycle, and use any tools or machines. Tell your doctor
