  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Irbesartan Zentiva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing 
them to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan Zentiva prevents the binding 
of angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. 
Irbesartan Zentiva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and 
type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p>Irbesartan Zentiva is used in adult patients </p>
<p>to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) </p>
<p>to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory 
evidence of impaired kidney function. </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to irbesartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) </p>
<p>if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan Zentiva in early 
pregnancy   see pregnancy section) </p>
<p>if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren. </p>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Zentiva and if any of the following apply to you: </p>
<p>if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea </p>
<p>if you suffer from kidney problems </p>
<p>if you suffer from heart problems </p>
<p>if you receive Irbesartan Zentiva for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may 
perform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor 
kidney function </p>
<p>if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. </p>
<p>if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics </p>
<p>if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: * an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. * aliskiren 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading  Do not take Irbesartan Zentiva . </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Zentiva is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy 
have not yet been fully established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Irbesartan Zentiva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. 
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take 
Irbesartan Zentiva   and  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>You may need to have blood checks if you take: </p>
<p>potassium supplements </p>
<p>salt substitutes containing potassium </p>
<p>potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) </p>
<p>medicines containing lithium </p>
<p>repaglinide (medication used for lowering blood sugar levels)  </p>
<p>If you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan 
may be reduced. </p>
<p>Irbesartan Zentiva with food and drink 
Irbesartan Zentiva can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Irbesartan Zentiva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you 
are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan Zentiva. Irbesartan 
Zentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months 
pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Irbesartan Zentiva is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Irbesartan Zentiva is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally 
dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, 
talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Irbesartan Zentiva contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>Irbesartan Zentiva contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per

<p>Method of administration 
Irbesartan Zentiva is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass 
of water). You can take Irbesartan Zentiva with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about 
the same time each day. It is important that you continue to take Irbesartan Zentiva until your doctor

In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, 300 mg (four tablets a day) once daily 
is the preferred maintenance dose for the treatment of associated kidney disease. </p>
<p>The doctor may advise a lower dose, especially when starting treatment in certain patients such as 
those on haemodialysis, or those over the age of 75 years. </p>
<p>The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents

tablets, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
