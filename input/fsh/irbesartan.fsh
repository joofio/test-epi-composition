Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing 
them to tighten.  This results in an increase in blood pressure.  Irbesartan Teva prevents the binding of 
angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower.<br />
Irbesartan Teva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 
diabetes.      </p>
<p>Irbesartan Teva is used in adult patients<br />
* to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension)

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Teva and if any of the following apply to you: 
* If you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea 
* If you suffer from kidney problems <br />
<em> If you suffer from heart problems <br />
</em> If you receive Irbesartan Teva for diabetic kidney disease.  In this case your doctor may 
perform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor 
kidney function <br />
<em> if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding heart 
beat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. 
* If you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics <br />
</em> if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have<br />
  diabetes-related kidney problems </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aliskiren </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading  Do not take Irbesartan Teva . 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.  Irbesartan Teva is not 
recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).   </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicinal product should not be given to children under 18 years of age because the safety and 
efficacy have not yet been fully established. If a child swallows some tablets, contact your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Irbesartan Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: </p>
<p>If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take 
Irbesartan Teva  and  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>You may need to have blood checks if you take: 
* potassium supplements 
* salt substitutes containing potassium 
* potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) 
* medicines containing lithium 
* repaglinide (medication used for lowering blood sugar levels) </p>
<p>If you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan 
may be reduced.   </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.  Your doctor will 
normally advise you to stop taking Irbesartan Teva before you become pregnant or as soon as you 
know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan Teva.<br />
Irbesartan Teva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 
months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.   </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Irbesartan Teva is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Irbesartan Teva is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  However, occasionally 
dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure.  If you experience these, 
talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Irbesartan Teva contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say
