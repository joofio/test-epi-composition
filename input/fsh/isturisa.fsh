Isturisa is a medicine that contains the active substance osilodrostat. </p>
<p>What Isturisa is used for 
Isturisa is used in adults to treat endogenous Cushing s syndrome, a condition in which the body 
produces too much of a hormone called cortisol. Too much cortisol may lead to a variety of symptoms 
such as weight gain (particularly around the waist), a moon-shaped face, bruising easily, irregular 
periods, excessive body and facial hair, and generally feeling weak, tired or unwell. </p>
<p>How Isturisa works 
Isturisa blocks the main enzyme that makes cortisol in the adrenal glands. The effect of this is to 
decrease the over-production of cortisol and improve the symptoms of endogenous Cushing s 
syndrome. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to osilodrostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Isturisa. </p>
<p>If any of the following apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Isturisa:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a heart disorder or a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat, including 
a condition called prolonged QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation). </li>
<li>if you have a liver disease; your doctor may need to change your dose of Isturisa. </li>
</ul>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately if you have two or more of these symptoms during your treatment 
with Isturisa. This may indicate that you have adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol levels):</p>
<ul>
<li>weakness </li>
<li>light-headedness </li>
<li>tiredness </li>
<li>lack of appetite </li>
<li>nausea (feeling sick) </li>
<li>vomiting </li>
</ul>
<p>Tests before and during treatment 
Your doctor will test your blood and/or urine before you start treatment and regularly during 
treatment. This is to detect any possible abnormalities in your magnesium, calcium and potassium 
levels and also to measure the levels of cortisol. Depending on the results, your doctor may change 
your dose. </p>
<p>This medicine may have an unwanted effect (called QT prolongation) on the function of the heart. 
Your doctor will therefore also check for this effect by performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) before 
you start treatment and during treatment. </p>
<p>If your Cushing s syndrome is caused by a benign tumour (called adenoma) in the pituitary gland, 
your doctor may consider stopping your treatment if a pituitary scan shows that the adenoma has 
expanded into neighbouring regions. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for patients aged under 18 years. This is because there is a lack of 
data in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Isturisa 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
particularly important that you mention any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines that may have an unwanted effect (called QT prolongation) on the function of the 
heart. These include medicines used for abnormal heart rhythm such as quinidine, sotalol and 
amiodarone; medicines used for allergies (antihistamines); antidepressants such as amitriptyline 
and drugs for mental health disorders (antipsychotics); antibiotics, including the following 
types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole; and other medicines for Cushing s disease 
(pasireotide, ketoconazole) </li>
<li>theophylline (used to treat breathing problems) or tizanidine (used to treat muscle pain and 
muscle cramps) </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding, unless your doctor has advised 
you to do so. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have 
a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Contraception 
Women who could become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least one week after the last dose. Ask your doctor about the need for contraception before 
you start taking Isturisa. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness and tiredness may occur during treatment with Isturisa. Do not drive or operate machines if 
you get these symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

respond to the treatment. The highest recommended dose is 30 mg twice a day. </p>
<p>Isturisa tablets are taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more Isturisa than you should 
If you have taken more Isturisa than you should and you feel unwell (for example if you feel weak, 
light-headed, tired or sick, or if you have to vomit), or if someone else accidentally takes your 
medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for advice immediately. Medical treatment may be needed. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Isturisa 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, just wait until it is time for your 
next dose and take that at the scheduled time. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Isturisa 
Do not stop taking Isturisa unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment with Isturisa,

more than 1 in 10 people. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when Isturisa lowers the amount of 
cortisol too much. It is more likely to occur during periods of increased stress. Your doctor will 
correct this by using a hormone medicine or by adjusting the dose of Isturisa. </li>
