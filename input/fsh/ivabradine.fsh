  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Ivabradine Zentiva (ivabradine) is a heart medicine used to treat: 
‒ 
Symptomatic stable angina pectoris (which causes chest pain) in adult patients whose heart rate 
is over or equal to 70 beats per minute. It is used in adult patients who do not tolerate or cannot take 
heart medicines called beta-blockers. It is also used in combination with beta-blockers in adult 
patients whose condition is not fully controlled with a beta-blocker. 
‒ 
Chronic heart failure in adult patients whose heart rate is over or equal to 75 beats per minute. 
It is used in combination with standard therapy, including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-
blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. </p>
<p>About stable angina pectoris (usually referred to as “angina”) </p>
<p>Stable angina is a heart disease which happens when the heart does not receive enough oxygen. The most 
common symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort.  </p>
<p>About chronic heart failure </p>
<p>Chronic heart failure is a heart disease which happens when your heart cannot pump enough blood 
to the rest of your body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, tiredness 
and ankle swelling. </p>
<p>How does Ivabradine Zentiva work? </p>
<p>The specific heart rate lowering action of ivabradine helps: 
‒ to control and reduce the number of angina attacks by lowering heart’s need for oxygen, 
‒ to improve the heart functioning and vital prognosis in  patients with chronic heart failure. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for stable angina pectoris </p>
<p>The starting dose should not exceed one tablet of Ivabradine Zentiva 5 mg twice daily. If you still have 
angina symptoms and if you have tolerated the 5 mg twice daily dose well, the dose may be increased. 
The maintenance dose should not exceed 7.5 mg twice daily. Your doctor will prescribe the right dose 
for you. The usual dose is one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening. In some cases 
(e.g. if you are aged 75 years or more), your doctor may prescribe half the dose i.e., one half 5 mg tablet 
of Ivabradine Zentiva 5 mg (corresponding to 2.5 mg ivabradine) in the morning and one half 5 mg tablet 
in the evening. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for chronic heart failure </p>
<p>The usual recommended starting dose is one tablet of Ivabradine Zentiva 5 mg twice daily increasing

<p>Method of administration 
Tablets must be taken orally twice daily, i.e. once in the morning and once in the evening during meals. 
Ivabradine Zentiva 5 mg film-coated tablet can be divided into equal doses. Use a tablet cutter to divide 
the tablet. </p>
<p>If you take more Ivabradine Zentiva than you should 
A large dose of Ivabradine Zentiva could make you feel breathless or tired because your heart slows down 
too much. If this happens, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Ivabradine Zentiva 
If you forget to take a dose of Ivabradine Zentiva, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take 
a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Ivabradine Zentiva 
As the treatment for angina or chronic heart failure is usually life-long, you should discuss with your 
doctor before stopping this medicinal product. 
If you think that the effect of Ivabradine Zentiva is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor 
or pharmacist. </p>
