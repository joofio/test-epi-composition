<li>What IVEMEND is and what it is used for
IVEMEND contains the active substance fosaprepitant which is converted to aprepitant in your body.
It belongs to a group of medicines called "neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists". The brain has a
specific area that controls nausea and vomiting. IVEMEND works by blocking signals to that area,
thereby reducing nausea and vomiting. IVEMEND is used in adults, adolescents, and children aged
6 months or older in combination with other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by
chemotherapy (cancer treatment) that is a strong or moderate trigger of nausea and vomiting.</li>

 
if you are allergic to fosaprepitant, aprepitant, or to polysorbate 80 or any of the other
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
 
with medicines containing pimozide (used to treat psychiatric illnesses), terfenadine and
astemizole (used for hay fever and other allergic conditions), cisapride (used for treating
digestive problems). Tell your doctor if you are taking these medicines since the treatment must
be modified before you start using IVEMEND.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using IVEMEND.
Before treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor if you have liver disease because the liver is
important in breaking down the medicine in the body. Your doctor may therefore have to monitor the
condition of your liver.
Children and adolescents
Do not give IVEMEND to children under 6 months of age or who weigh less than 6 kg, because it has
not been studied in this population.

Other medicines and IVEMEND
IVEMEND can affect other medicines both during and after treatment with IVEMEND. There are
some medicines that should not be taken with IVEMEND (such as pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole,
and cisapride) or that require a dose adjustment (see also ‘Do not use IVEMEND’). 
The effects of IVEMEND or other medicines might be influenced if you take IVEMEND together
with other medicines including those listed below. Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are
taking any of the following medicines:
- birth control medicines which can include birth control pills, skin patches, implants, and certain
Intrauterine devices (IUDs) that release hormones may not work adequately when taken
together with IVEMEND. Another or additional non-hormonal form of birth control should be
used during treatment with IVEMEND and for up to 2 months after using IVEMEND,
- ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus (immunosuppressants), 
- alfentanil, fentanyl (used to treat pain), 
- quinidine (used to treat an irregular heart beat),

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
This medicine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or
breast-feeding, may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before
receiving this medicine.
For information regarding birth control, see ‘Other medicines and IVEMEND’.
It is not known whether IVEMEND is excreted in human milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not
recommended during treatment with this medicine. It is important to tell your doctor if you are
breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed before receiving this medicine.
Driving and using machines
It should be taken into account that some people get dizzy and get sleepy after using IVEMEND. If
you get dizzy or get sleepy, avoid driving or using machines after using this medicine (see ‘Possible
side effects’).

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially

Day 1 (day of chemotherapy). 
In children and adolescents (6 months to 17 years of age), the recommended dose of IVEMEND is
based on the patient’s age and weight. Depending on the chemotherapy treatment, there are two ways
IVEMEND may be given:
IVEMEND is given only on Day 1 (single day of chemotherapy)
IVEMEND is given on Day 1, 2, and 3 (single or multiple days of chemotherapy)
o 
Oral formulations of aprepitant may be prescribed on Days 2 and 3 instead of IVEMEND.
The powder is reconstituted and diluted before use. The solution for infusion is given to you by a
health care professional, such as a doctor or nurse, via an intravenous infusion (a drip) approximately
30 minutes before you start the chemotherapy treatment in adults or 60 – 90 minutes before you start
the chemotherapy treatment in children and adolescents. Your doctor may ask you to take other
medicines including a corticosteroid (such as dexamethasone) and a ‘5HT3 antagonist’ (such as
ondansetron) for preventing nausea and vomiting. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not
sure.</p>         </div>"""
