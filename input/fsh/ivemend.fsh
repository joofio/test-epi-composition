It belongs to a group of medicines called "neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists". The brain has a
specific area that controls nausea and vomiting. IVEMEND works by blocking signals to that area,
thereby reducing nausea and vomiting. IVEMEND is used in adults, adolescents, and children aged
6 months or older in combination with other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by
chemotherapy (cancer treatment) that is a strong or moderate trigger of nausea and vomiting.</p>         </div>"""

<p>with medicines containing pimozide (used to treat psychiatric illnesses), terfenadine and
astemizole (used for hay fever and other allergic conditions), cisapride (used for treating
digestive problems). Tell your doctor if you are taking these medicines since the treatment must
be modified before you start using IVEMEND.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using IVEMEND.
Before treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor if you have liver disease because the liver is
important in breaking down the medicine in the body. Your doctor may therefore have to monitor the
condition of your liver.
Children and adolescents
Do not give IVEMEND to children under 6 months of age or who weigh less than 6 kg, because it has
not been studied in this population.
Other medicines and IVEMEND
IVEMEND can affect other medicines both during and after treatment with IVEMEND. There are
some medicines that should not be taken with IVEMEND (such as pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole,
and cisapride) or that require a dose adjustment (see also  Do not use IVEMEND ). 
The effects of IVEMEND or other medicines might be influenced if you take IVEMEND together
with other medicines including those listed below. Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are
taking any of the following medicines:</p>

breast-feeding, may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before
receiving this medicine.

recommended during treatment with this medicine. It is important to tell your doctor if you are
breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed before receiving this medicine.
Driving and using machines
It should be taken into account that some people get dizzy and get sleepy after using IVEMEND. If
you get dizzy or get sleepy, avoid driving or using machines after using this medicine (see  Possible
side effects ).

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .</li>

health care professional, such as a doctor or nurse, via an intravenous infusion (a drip) approximately
30 minutes before you start the chemotherapy treatment in adults or 60   90 minutes before you start
the chemotherapy treatment in children and adolescents. Your doctor may ask you to take other
medicines including a corticosteroid (such as dexamethasone) and a  5HT3 antagonist  (such as

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Instructions of how to reconstitute and dilute IVEMEND 150 mg
1. Inject 5 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into the vial. Assure that
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection is added to the vial along the vial wall
in order to prevent foaming. Swirl the vial gently. Avoid shaking and jetting sodium chloride
9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into the vial.
2. Prepare an infusion bag filled with 145 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for
injection (for example, by removing 105 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for
injection from a 250 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection infusion bag).
3. Withdraw the entire volume from the vial and transfer it into an infusion bag containing 145 ml
of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection to yield a total volume of 150 ml
and final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Gently invert the bag 2-3 times (see  How to use
IVEMEND ).
4. Determine the volume to be administered from this prepared infusion bag, based on the
recommended dose (see Summary of Product Characteristic (SmPC), section 4.2). </p>
<p>Adults</p>
<p>The entire volume of the prepared infusion bag (150 ml) should be administered.</p>
<p>Paediatrics</p>
<p>In patients 12 years and older, the volume to be administered is calculated as follows: 
  Volume to administer (ml) equals the recommended dose (mg) 
In patients 6 months to less than 12 years, the volume to be administered is calculated as
follows:
  Volume to administer (ml) = recommended dose (mg/kg) x weight (kg) * 
Note: Do not exceed maximum doses (see Summary of Product
Characteristic (SmPC), section 4.2).
5. If necessary, for volumes less than 150 ml, the calculated volume can be transferred to an
appropriate size bag or syringe prior to administration by infusion. 
The reconstituted and diluted final solution is stable for 24 hours at 25 C.
Parenteral medicines should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before
administration whenever solution and container permit. 
The appearance of the reconstituted solution is the same as the appearance of the diluent.
Discard any remaining solution and waste material. Any unused medicinal product or waste material
should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
The medicinal product must not be reconstituted or mixed with solutions for which physical and
chemical compatibility has not been established (see Summary of Product Characteristic (SmPC),
section 6.2).</p>         </div>"""
