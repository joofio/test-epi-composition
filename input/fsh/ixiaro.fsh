The vaccine causes the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against this disease. </p>
<p>IXIARO is used to prevent infection with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). This virus is mainly found 
in Asia and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that have bitten an infected animal (like pigs). Many 
infected people develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who develop severe disease, JE 
usually starts as a flu-like illness, with fever, chills, tiredness, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Confusion 
and agitation also occur in the early stage of disease. </p>
<p>IXIARO should be given only to adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 2 months and older travelling 
to countries, where JE is endemic or who are at risk through work. </p>         </div>"""

* If you and/or your child are allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substance or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* If you and/or your child have developed an allergic reaction after receiving a former dose of 
IXIARO. Signs of an allergic reaction may include an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of 
the face and tongue. 
* If you and/or your child are ill with a high fever. In this case, your doctor will postpone the 
vaccination. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
IXIARO must not be injected into a blood vessel. 
Primary immunization should be completed at least one week prior to potential exposure to JEV. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor: 
* If you and/or your child have experienced any health problems after previous administration of any 
vaccine. 
* If you and/or your child have any other known allergies. 
* If you and/or your child have a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal) 
or a reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia). 
* If your child is younger than 2 months of age, since IXIARO has not been tested in infants younger 
than 2 months of age. 
* If your or your child’s immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you and/or 
your child are taking medicines affecting your immune system (such as a medicine called cortisone 
or cancer medicine). </p>
<p>Your doctor will discuss with you the possible risks and benefits of receiving IXIARO. </p>
<p>Please note that: 
* IXIARO cannot cause the disease it protects against. 
* IXIARO will not prevent infections caused by other viruses than the Japanese encephalitis virus. 
* As with any other vaccine, vaccination with IXIARO may not result in protection in all cases. 
* You should take appropriate precautions for you and your child to reduce mosquito bites (adequate 
clothing, use of repellents, mosquito nets) even after receiving IXIARO. </p>
<p>Other medicines and IXIARO 
Studies in humans to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medicines (clinical trials) have shown that 
IXIARO can be given at the same time with hepatitis A vaccine and rabies vaccine. 
Tell your doctor if you and/or your child are taking or have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility 
There are limited amount of data from the use of IXIARO in pregnant or breast-feeding women. 
As a precautionary measure, the use of IXIARO during pregnancy or breast-feeding should be avoided. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before receiving this vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
IXIARO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>IXIARO contains potassium and sodium<br />
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage i.e. essentially 
‘potassium-free’ and less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml single dosage, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. This product might contain traces of residual sodium metabisulfite which is below detection 
limit.  </p>         </div>"""
