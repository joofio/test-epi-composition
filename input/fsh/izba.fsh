<p>if you are allergic to travoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice if this applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>IZBA may increase the length, thickness, colour and/or number of your eyelashes. Changes in 
the eyelids including unusual hair growth or in the tissues around the eye have also been 
observed. </p>
<p>IZBA may gradually change the colour of your iris (the coloured part of your eye). This 
change may be permanent. </p>
<p>If you have had cataract surgery talk to your doctor before you use IZBA. IZBA may increase 
the risk of inflammation of the back of the eye. </p>
<p>If you have current or previous history of an eye inflammation (iritis and uveitis) talk to your 
doctor before you use IZBA. Eye inflammation is a possible side effect which may be 
associated with the use of prostaglandin analogues such as IZBA. </p>
<p>Travoprost may be absorbed through the skin. If any of the medicinal product comes into 
contact with the skin, it should be washed off straight away. This is especially important in 
women who are pregnant or are attempting to become pregnant. </p>
<p>If you wear soft contact lenses, do not use the drops with your lenses in. After using the drops 
wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using IZBA. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Use of IZBA is not recommended to those children under 3 years of age. The safety and efficacy of 
travoprost have not been established in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and IZBA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use IZBA if you are pregnant. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not 
known. If you think that you may be pregnant speak with your doctor right away. If you could become 
pregnant you must use adequate contraception whilst you use IZBA. </p>
<p>Do not use IZBA if you are breast-feeding. IZBA may get into your milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after you use IZBA. Do not drive or use 
machines until this has worn off. </p>
<p>IZBA contains hydrogenated castor oil and propylene glycol which may cause skin reactions and 
irritation. </p>         </div>"""

should check with your doctor, the doctor treating your child or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is </p>
<p>One drop in the affected eye or eyes, once a day in the evening. 
Only use IZBA in both eyes if your doctor told you to. Use it for as long as your doctor or the doctor 
treating your child told you to. 
IZBA can be used in children from 3 years to &lt;18 years at the same dose as for adults. </p>
<p>IZBA should only be used as an eye drop. </p>

<p>Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, tear open the overwrap pouch, take the 
bottle out (picture 1) and write the date of opening on the carton in the space provided. </p>
<p>Wash your hands. </p>
<p>Twist off the cap. </p>
<p>Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. </p>
<p>Tilt your head or your child s head gently back. Pull down the eyelid with a clean finger, until 
there is a  pocket  between the eyelid and the eye. The drop will go in here (picture 2). </p>
<p>Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use a mirror if it helps. </p>
<p>Do not touch the eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It 
could infect the drops. </p>
<p>Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of IZBA at a time. (picture 3). </p>
<p>After using IZBA, keep the eyelid closed, apply gentle pressure by pressing a finger into the 
corner of the eye, by the nose (picture 4) for at least 1 minute. This helps to stop IZBA getting 
into the rest of the body. </p>
<p>If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for the other eye. </p>
<p>Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use. </p>
<p>Only use one bottle at a time. Do not open the pouch until you need to use the bottle. </p>
<p>If a drop misses your eye, try again. </p>
<p>If you or your child are using other eye preparations such as eye drop or eye ointment, wait for at 
least 5 minutes between putting in IZBA and the other eye preparations. </p>
<p>If you or your child use more IZBA than you should 
Rinse all the medicine out with warm water. Don t put in any more drops until it s time for your next 
regular dose. If IZBA is swallowed, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to use IZBA 
Continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
Never use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) in a single day. </p>
<p>If you stop using IZBA 
Do not stop using IZBA without first speaking to your doctor or the doctor treating your child, the 
pressure in your eye or your child s eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, the doctor treating your 
child or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
