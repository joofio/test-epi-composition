  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>The active substance of Jalra, vildagliptin, belongs to a group of medicines called  oral antidiabetics . </p>
<p>Jalra is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It is used when diabetes cannot be controlled 
by diet and exercise alone. It helps to control the level of sugar in the blood. Your doctor will 
prescribe Jalra either alone or together with certain other antidiabetic medicines which you will 
already be taking, if these have not proved sufficiently effective to control diabetes. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body 
makes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. </p>
<p>Insulin is a substance which helps to lower the level of sugar in the blood, especially after meals. 
Glucagon is a substance which triggers the production of sugar by the liver, causing the blood sugar 
level to rise. The pancreas makes both of these substances. </p>
<p>How Jalra works 
Jalra works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. This helps to control the 
blood sugar level. This medicine has been shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent 
complications from your diabetes. Even though you are now starting a medicine for your diabetes, it is 
important that you continue to follow the diet and/or exercise which has been recommended for you. </p>         </div>"""

Jalra, do not take this medicine and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions

* if you have type 1 diabetes (i.e. your body does not produce insulin) or if you have a condition 
called diabetic ketoacidosis. 
* if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea (your doctor may want to 
reduce your dose of the sulphonylurea when you take it together with Jalra in order to avoid low 
blood glucose [hypoglycaemia]). 
* if you have moderate or severe kidney disease (you will need to take a lower dose of Jalra). 
* if you are on dialysis. 
* if you have liver disease. 
* if you suffer from heart failure.

<p>Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also

occur, you should promptly consult your doctor. </p>
<p>A test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of Jalra treatment, at three-
month intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. This is so that signs of increased liver 
enzymes can be detected as early as possible. </p>
