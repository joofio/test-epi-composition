  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Jayempi 10 mg/ml oral suspension contains the active substance azathioprine. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called immunosuppressants. 
These medicines reduce the activity of your immune system (the body’s defences). </p>
<p>Jayempi is used to: 
* Prevent your body from rejecting an organ transplant. Jayempi is usually used together with 
other immunosuppressants for this purpose 
* Treat some long-term diseases where the immune system is reacting against your body. Jayempi 
is usually used in combination with steroids or other anti-inflammatory medicines. These 
diseases include: 
- Severe rheumatoid arthritis or chronic polyarthritis (long term chronic inflammation of 
multiple joints) which cannot be controlled by other medicines 
- Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (diseases of the gut such as Crohn’s disease and 
ulcerative colitis) 
- Chronic hepatitis (autoimmune hepatitis), a liver disease 
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (a disease in which the immune system attacks different 
organs) 
- Dermatomyositis (worsening muscle inflammation together with skin rash) 
- Polyarteritis nodosa (inflammation of blood vessels) 
- Pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid (diseases of blistering of the skin) 
- Behçet’s disease (recurrent inflammation, especially of the eyes and the oral and genital 
mucous membranes). 
- Refractory autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (a blood disease in which the red blood cells are 
destroyed) 
- Chronic refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (bleeding under the skin due to 
damage to the platelets and reduction of their numbers) 
* Treat relapsing multiple sclerosis. 
* Treat generalised myasthenia gravis (a disease that affects nerves and causes muscle weakness). 
In some cases Jayempi is given in with a steroid at the start of treatment </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to azathioprine, another medicine called mercaptopurine or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
<li>if you are breastfeeding. </li>
<li>if you have recently had a vaccination with a live vaccine such as tuberculosis (BCG), 
chickenpox, MMR or yellow fever. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Jayempi: 
- if you have a serious infection. 
- if you have a serious liver disease. 
- if you have a disease of the bone marrow or the pancreas. 
- if you suffer from a condition known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (hereditary deficiency of the 
enzyme Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase). 
- if you have a condition where your body produces too little of an enzyme called thiopurine 
methyltransferase (TPMT). 
- if you take medicines like mesalazine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine (for the treatment of 
inflammatory bowel disease). 
- if you take medicines which affect bone marrow function (for producing blood cells), such as 
penicillamine and cytotoxic medicines. </p>
<p>If you notice any unexplained bruising or bleeding during treatment or you have signs of 
infection, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Infections </p>
<p>Treatment with Jayempi increases the risk of infections and the infections may become more serious 
(see also section 4). 
Because chickenpox (caused by varicella-zoster virus VZV) can be serious when you are taking 
Jayempi, you should avoid any contact with people suffering from chickenpox (varicella) or shingles 
(herpes zoster). 
Tell your doctor if you come into contact with anyone who has chickenpox or shingles. 
Your doctor will decide if you need antiviral treatment and if you should stop treatment with Jayempi. </p>
<p>Blood tests </p>
<p>You will need a blood test to check your blood cell count at least once a week during the first 8 weeks 
of treatment. You may need blood tests more often if you: </p>
<ul>
<li>are taking high doses of Jayempi </li>
<li>are elderly </li>
<li>have a kidney or liver disorder </li>
</ul>
<p>After 8 weeks, your blood count should be checked once a month or at least every 3 months. </p>
<p>NUDT15-gene mutation 
If you have an inherited mutation in the NUDT15-gene (a gene which is involved in the break-down 
of azathioprine in the body), you have a higher risk of infections and hair loss and your doctor may in 
this case give you a lower dose. 
Your doctor may also ask you to have a test to check how well your body will be able to break-down 
this medicine. Your doctor may change your dose after these tests. </p>
<p>Taking Jayempi may increase your risk of: </p>
<ul>
<li>developing a serious condition called macrophage activation syndrome (excessive activation of 
white blood cells associated with inflammation), which usually occurs in people who have 
certain types of arthritis </li>
<li>developing tumours, especially if you are receiving immunosuppressive therapy at high doses or 
for a long time </li>
<li>developing cancers such as skin cancer caused by exposure to the sun. Therefore, you should 
avoid unnecessary exposure to the sunlight and UV light, wear protective clothing and use 
sunscreen (minimum of sun protection factor (SPF) 30) </li>
<li>lymphoproliferative disorders (when the body produces white cells called lymphocytes in an 
uncontrolled way) 
With treatments that include several immunosuppressants (including thiopurines like 
azathioprine) the condition can lead to death </li>
<li>viral infections of the lymphatic system (Epstein-Barr virus related lymphoproliferative 
disorders), especially if several immunosuppressants are given at the same time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Jayempi </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Jayempi can affect the way some medicines work. Also some other 
medicines can affect the way Jayempi works: 
- Ribavirin, used to treat viral infections 
- Allopurinol, oxipurinol or thiopurinol or other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as 
febuxostat (mainly used to treat gout) 
- Mesalazine, olsalazine, and sulfasalazine (treatments for chronic inflammatory bowel disease 
such as Crohn's disease) 
- Anticoagulants such as warfarin 
- ACE inhibitors (such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril, treatments for high blood 
pressure or heart failure) 
- Trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) 
- Cimetidine (treatment for ulcers of the digestive tract) 
- Indometacin (treatment for rheumatoid arthritis) 
- Penicillamine (mainly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis) 
- Cytotoxic medicines (to treat tumours, such as methotrexate) 
- Vaccination with live vaccines during treatment with Jayempi can be harmful and must be 
avoided. 
- Atracurium or suxamethonium chloride used as muscle relaxants in surgery. 
- Infliximab (used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. 
ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis) </p>
<p>Before an operation tell your doctor that you are taking azathioprine because muscle relaxants 
used during anaesthesia may interact with azathioprine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Women taking Jayempi or the female partners of men taking Jayempi must not become pregnant 
during treatment and for 6 months afterwards. Both men and women taking Jayempi must use 
effective contraception during treatment with and for 6 months afterwards. Intrauterine devices are not 
suitable for contraception in women taking Jayempi (or in women whose male partners are taking 
Jayempi). </p>
<p>If you are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor. 
If you are pregnant, you should only take Jayempi if your doctor tells you to. In case you are or 
believe you might be pregnant you must inform your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Changes in blood counts can occur in newborn babies of mothers who received azathioprine during 
pregnancy. Regular checks of blood counts during pregnancy are recommended. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during therapy with Jayempi. This is because small amounts may pass into the 
mother’s milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you are affected or if you feel dizzy while taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Jayempi contains sodium benzoate (E211) 
This medicine contains 1.5 mg sodium benzoate (E211) in each ml. Sodium benzoate may increase 
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old). </p>
<p>Jayempi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- free’. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure  </p>
<p>Dose </p>
<p>The dose of Jayempi depends on your weight, the condition being treated, how well it is being 
controlled and your overall health. Your doctor will work out the dose that is right for you and may 
adjust it during treatment. The doctor will tell you how long you should continue taking the medicine. </p>
<p>For preventing organ rejection after transplantation, the usual starting dose is 5 mg per kg of your 
weight each day and the dose is then reduced after a few weeks or months to between 1 and 4 mg per 
kg of your weight each day. 
The dose for other conditions is usually between 1 and 3 mg per kg of your weight each day. </p>
<p>Kidney/ liver disease 
Your dose may be reduced if you have kidney or liver disease. </p>
<p>Use in children 
The dose for children and adolescents is the same as the adult dose. 
The safety and efficacy of azathioprine in children have not yet been established for the treatment of 
chronic joint inflammation (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, the use of 
Jayempi for these conditions in children is not recommended. </p>
<p>Use in elderly patients 
A reduced dose may be needed. </p>
<p>Jayempi with food and drink </p>
<p>Jayempi should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal or milk. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>You should drink some water after each dose of Jayempi. This helps to make sure that the full dose of 
the medicine enters your digestive system. </p>
<p>Handling </p>
<p>Your pack contains a 200-ml bottle of medicine, cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes (a 3-ml 
syringe and a 10-ml syringe). Always use the syringes provided to take your medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>The smaller 3 ml oral syringe is marked from 0.5 ml to 3 ml with minor 0.1 ml graduations. It 
is used for measuring doses of up to 30 mg, in 1 mg (0.1 ml) step ups. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example: 
- if the prescribed dose is 14 mg, use the 3 ml syringe and draw up a volume of 1.4 ml. 
- if the prescribed dose is 26 mg, use the 3 ml syringe and draw up a volume of 2.6 ml. </p>
<ul>
<li>The larger 10 ml oral syringe is marked from 1 ml to 10 ml with minor 0.25 ml graduations. It 
is used for measuring doses greater than 30 mg, in 2.5 mg (0.25 ml) step ups. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example: 
- if the prescribed dose is 32 mg, use the 10 ml syringe and draw up a volume of 3.25 ml. 
- if the prescribed dose is 54 mg, use the 10 ml syringe and draw up a volume of 5.5 ml. 
- if the prescribed dose is 140 mg, use the 10 ml syringe twice to draw up a dose of 10.0 ml 
followed by 4.0 ml (14 ml in total). </p>
<p>It is important to use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell 
you which syringe to use depending on the dose prescribed for you. </p>
<p>If you are taking or giving the medicine to a child or somebody else, wash your hands before and after. 
Wipe up spillages immediately. To decrease the risk of coming into contact with the medicine, use 
disposable gloves when handling Jayempi. 
If Jayempi comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, wash the area immediately and thoroughly with 
soap and water. </p>
<p>When you use the medicine follow the instructions below: </p>
