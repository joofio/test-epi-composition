  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Jaypirca is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance pirtobrutinib. It belongs to a class of 
medicines called Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.  </p>
<p>It is used on its own (monotherapy) to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in adult patients who have 
been previously treated with another BTK inhibitor. MCL is an aggressive (fast growing) cancer of a 
type of white blood cell called B-cells. B-cells are part of the immune system (the body s natural 
defences). This medicine is used when the cancer has come back (relapsed), or treatment has not 
worked (refractory).  </p>
<p>How Jaypirca works 
In MCL, Jaypirca works by blocking BTK, a protein in the body that helps MCL cells grow and 
survive. By blocking BTK, Jaypirca helps to kill these cells and can reduce their number, which can 
slow down the worsening of the cancer.  </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to pirtobrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Jaypirca: 
* If you have an infection or are at an increased risk of developing an opportunistic infection 
(infections seen in patients with a weakened immune system). Your doctor may give you 
medicines to treat or prevent infections. 
* If you have or ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements 
that could increase your risk of bleeding. See section  Other medicines and Jaypirca  below. 
* If you recently had low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), neutrophils (a type of white blood 
cell that fights infections) or platelets (components that help the blood to clot) . 
* If you have recently had any surgery or are planning to have surgery. Your doctor may ask you 
to stop taking Jaypirca for a short time (3 to 5 days) before and after your surgery. 
* If you have or ever had an irregular heartbeat or have other heart and/or blood vessel problems, 
such as high blood pressure, history of a heart attack or have heart valve damage. </p>
<p>You may get infections during treatment with Jaypirca. Contact your doctor if you have fever, chills, 
weakness, confusion, body aches, cough, cold or flu symptoms, feel tired, feel short of breath, have 
pain or burning feeling when passing urine. These could be signs of an infection.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you develop a new lesion or any change in the appearance of an area on the skin, 
as treatment with Jaypirca may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Use sun protection and 
make regular skin examinations.  </p>
<p>Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells, known as 
tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), have been reported rarely during treatment with Jaypirca. This may lead 
to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor or another healthcare<br />
professional may do blood tests to check for TLS. </p>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you for the signs and symptoms of bleeding (see section 4) and check your 
blood cell counts as needed during treatment. </p>
<p>Your doctor may monitor your heart rhythm for any irregularities throughout treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give Jaypirca to children and adolescents aged less than 18 years. This is because it has not 
been studied in this age group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Jaypirca 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Jaypirca may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take 
other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes medicines such as: 
* acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen 
and naproxen, 
* anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin and other medicines for treating or preventing blood 
clots, 
* supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking Jaypirca. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines as Jaypirca may affect how 
well these medicines work:

* Selexipag (used to treat a type of high blood pressure in the lungs called pulmonary arterial 
hypertension)
