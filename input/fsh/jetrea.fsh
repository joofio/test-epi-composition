<p>Jetrea is used to treat adults with an eye disease called vitreomacular traction (VMT), including when 
it is associated with a small hole in the macula (central part of the light-sensitive layer at the back of 
the eye). </p>
<p>VMT is caused by traction resulting from a persistent attachment of the vitreous humour (jelly-like 
material in the back of the eye) to the macula. The macula provides central vision that is needed for 
everyday tasks such as driving, reading and recognising faces. VMT can cause symptoms such as 
distorted or decreased vision. When the disease progresses the traction may eventually result in the 
formation of a hole in the macula (called a macular hole). </p>
<p>Jetrea works by separating the vitreous humour from the macula, and helping to close the macular hole 
if one is present, which may decrease the symptoms caused by VMT. </p>         </div>"""

section 6);<br />
- if you have (or suspect you may have) an infection in or around your eye. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor/ophthalmologist before you are given Jetrea. </p>
<p>Jetrea is given as an injection into the eye. Your doctor/ophthalmologist will monitor you in case you 
develop an infection or any complications after the injection. You should contact your 
doctor/ophthalmologist immediately if you develop any of the eye symptoms described in section 4, 
after an injection of Jetrea. </p>
<p>You will not be given Jetrea into both eyes at the same time.  </p>
<p>You will not be given Jetrea more than once into the same eye. 
Tell your doctor/ophthalmologist if you have or have had any eye conditions or eye treatments. Your 
doctor/ophthalmologist will decide if treatment with Jetrea is right for you. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is no relevant use of Jetrea in children and adolescents below 18 years old. The use of Jetrea is 
therefore not recommended in this patient group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Jetrea 
Tell your doctor/ophthalmologist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Inform your doctor/ophthalmologist if you have had an injection of a medicine into the eye 
recently. This information will be taken into account to evaluate if and when Jetrea can be injected 
into the same eye.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
There is no experience of using Jetrea in pregnant women or during breast-feeding. Jetrea should not 
be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding unless your doctor/ophthalmologist thinks it is clearly 
necessary. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor/ophthalmologist for advice before being given this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
After Jetrea treatment you may experience some decrease in vision for a limited amount of time. If this 
happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines until your vision improves. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Your doctor/ophthalmologist may ask you to use antibiotic eye drops before and after the injection in
