<li>you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cabazitaxel, to other taxanes, or polysorbate 80 or any of the 
other excipients of this medicine (listed in section 6),  </li>
<li>the number of your white blood cells is too low (neutrophil counts less than or equal to 
1,500 /mm3), </li>
<li>you have severe abnormal liver function, </li>
<li>you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever.  </li>
</ul>
<p>You should not be given JEVTANA if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor before having JEVTANA. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Before each treatment with JEVTANA, you will have blood tests to check that you have enough blood 
cells and sufficient liver and kidney functions to receive JEVTANA. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if:<br />
* you have fever. During treatment with JEVTANA, it is more likely that your white blood cell 
count may be reduced. Your doctor will monitor your blood and general condition for signs of 
infections. He/she may give you other medicines to maintain the number of your blood cells. 
People with low blood counts can develop life-threatening infections. The earliest sign of 
infection may be fever, so if you experience fever, tell your doctor right away. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you have ever had any allergies. Serious allergic reactions can occur during treatment with 
JEVTANA.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have severe or long-lasting diarrhoea, you feel sick (nausea) or you are being sick 
(vomiting). Any of these events could cause severe dehydration. Your doctor may need to treat 
you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have feeling of numbness, tingling, burning or decreased sensation in your hands or feet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have any bleeding problems from the gut or have changes in the colour of your stool or 
stomach pain. If the bleeding or pain is severe, your doctor will stop your treatment with 
JEVTANA. This is because JEVTANA may increase the risk of bleeding or developing holes in 
the gut wall.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have kidney problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have yellowing of the skin and eyes, darkening of the urine, severe nausea (feeling sick) or 
vomiting, as they could be signs or symptoms of liver problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you experience any significant increase or decrease in daily urinary volume.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have blood in your urine. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. Your doctor may reduce the dose of 
JEVTANA or stop the treatment. </p>
<p>Other medicines and JEVTANA  </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because some medicines 
can affect the way JEVTANA works or JEVTANA can affect how other medicines work. These 
medicines include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>ketoconazole, rifampicin (for infections); </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin (for seizures); </li>
<li>St John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) (herbal remedy for depression and other conditions); </li>
<li>statins (such  as simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pravastatin) (for reducing the 
cholesterol in your blood); </li>
<li>valsartan (for hypertension); </li>
<li>repaglinide (for diabetes). </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor before getting vaccinations while you are receiving JEVTANA.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>JEVTANA is not indicated for use in women.  </p>
<p>Use a condom during sex if your partner is or could become pregnant. JEVTANA could be present in 
your semen and may affect the foetus. You are advised not to father a child during and up to 4 months 
after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because JEVTANA may 
alter male fertility.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You may feel tired or dizzy when having this medicine. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools 
or machines until you feel better. </p>
<p>JEVTANA contains ethanol (alcohol) </p>
<p>This medicine contains 573 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each solvent vial. The amount in the dose of 
this medicine is equivalent to less than 11 ml beer or 5 ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this 
medicine will not have any noticeable effects.  If you are addicted to alcohol, have liver disease or 
epilepsy, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
