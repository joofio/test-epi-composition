vasopressin, Jinarc slows the development of kidney cysts in patients with ADPKD, reduces symptoms 
of the disease and increases urine production. </p>
<p>Jinarc is a medicine used to treat a disease called  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease<br />
(ADPKD). This disease causes growth of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, which put pressure on 
surrounding tissues and reduce kidney function, possibly leading to kidney failure. Jinarc is used to treat 
ADPKD in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1 to 4 with evidence of rapidly progressing 
disease. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to tolvaptan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
or if you are allergic to benzazepine or benzazepine derivatives (e.g. benazepril, conivaptan, 
fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine) 
* if you have been told that you have raised levels of liver enzymes in your blood which do not 
allow treatment with tolvaptan 
* if your kidneys do not work (no urine production) 
* if you have a condition which is associated with a very low blood volume (e.g. severe 
dehydration or bleeding) 
* if you have a condition which increases the sodium in your blood 
* if you do not realise when you are thirsty 
* if you are pregnant 
* if you are breastfeeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Jinarc 
* if you suffer from liver disease. 
* if you cannot drink enough water (see  drinking enough water  below) or if you have to restrict 
your fluid intake. 
* if you have difficulties urinating (e.g. have an enlarged prostate). 
* if you suffer from too high or too low blood sodium. 
* if you had an allergic reaction in the past to benzazepine, tolvaptan or other benzazepine 
derivatives (e.g. benazepril, conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine), or to any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* if you have diabetes. 
* if you have been told you have high levels of a chemical called uric acid in your blood (which 
may have caused attacks of gout). 
* if you have advanced kidney disease. </p>
<p>This medicine may cause your liver to not work properly. Therefore, please inform your doctor 
immediately if you have signs that could indicate potential liver problems such as: 
* nausea 
* vomiting 
* fever 
* tiredness 
* loss of appetite 
* pain in the abdomen 
* dark urine 
* jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes) 
* itching of your skin 
* flu-like syndrome (joint and muscle pain with fever) </p>
<p>During treatment with this medicine, your doctor will arrange monthly blood tests to check for 
changes in your liver function. </p>
<p>Drinking enough water </p>
<p>This medicine causes water loss because it increases your urine production. This water loss may result 
in side effects such as dry mouth and thirst or even more severe side effects like kidney problems (see 
section 4). It is therefore important that you have access to water and that you are able to drink sufficient 
amounts when you feel thirsty. Before bed-time you must drink 1 or 2 glasses of water even if you do 
not feel thirsty and you must also drink water after you urinate at night. Special care must be taken if 
you have a disease that reduces appropriate fluid intake or if you are at an increased risk of water loss 
e.g. in case of vomiting or diarrhoea. Due to the increased urine production, it is also important that you 
always have access to a toilet. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents (under age of 18 years) because it has not been 
studied in these age groups. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Jinarc 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>The following medicines may increase the effect of Jinarc: 
* amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir (used to treat HIV/AIDS), 
* aprepitant (used to avoid nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy), 
* crizotinib and imatinib (used to treat cancer), 
* ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole (used to treat fungal infections), 
* macrolide antibiotics like erythromycin or clarithromycin, 
* verapamil (used to treat heart diseases and high blood pressure), 
* ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic), 
* diltiazem (used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain). </p>
<p>The following medicines may lower the effect of Jinarc: 
* phenytoin or carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy), 
* rifampicin, rifabutin or rifapentine (used to treat tuberculosis), 
* St. John s Wort (a traditional herbal medicinal product for the relief of slightly low mood and 
mild anxiety). </p>
<p>Jinarc may increase the effect of the following medicines: 
* digoxin (used to treat irregular heart beat and heart failure), 
* dabigatran (used to thin the blood), 
* sulfasalazine (used to treat inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis), 
* metformin (used to treat diabetes). </p>
<p>Jinarc may lower the effect of the following medicines: 
* vasopressin analogues such as desmopressin (used to increase blood clotting factors or to control 
urine output or bedwetting). </p>
<p>These medicines can affect or be affected by Jinarc: 
* diuretics (used to influence the production of urine). Taken with Jinarc these may increase the 
risk of side effects due to water loss or may cause kidney problems. 
* diuretics or other medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure. Taken with Jinarc these may 
increase the risk of low blood pressure when you stand up from sitting or lying down. 
* medicines which increase the level of sodium in your blood or which contain large amounts of 
salt (e.g. tablets that dissolve in water and indigestion remedies). These may increase the effect of 
Jinarc. There is a risk that this may lead to too much sodium in your blood. </p>
<p>It may still be alright for you to take these medicines and Jinarc together. Your doctor will be able to 
decide what is suitable for you. </p>
<p>Jinarc with food and drink 
Do not drink grapefruit juice when taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Women of childbearing age must use reliable contraceptive measures during use of this medicine. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some people may feel dizzy, weak or tired after being given Jinarc. If this happens to you, do not drive 
or use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Jinarc contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>Dose </p>
<p>The daily amount of Jinarc is split into two doses, one bigger than the other. The higher dose should be 
taken in the morning when you wake up, at least 30 minutes before the morning meal. The lower dose is 
taken 8 hours later. </p>
<p>The dose combinations are: 
45 mg + 15 mg 
60 mg + 30 mg 
90 mg + 30 mg </p>
<p>Your treatment will normally start with a dose of 45 mg in the morning and 15 mg 8 hours later. Your 
doctor may gradually increase your dose up to a maximum combination of 90 mg on waking and 30 mg 
after 8 hours. To find the best dose your doctor will regularly check how well you are tolerating a 
prescribed dose. You should always take the highest tolerable dose combination prescribed by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>If you take other medicines, which can increase the effects of Jinarc you may receive lower doses. In 
this case your doctor may prescribe you Jinarc tablets with 30 mg or 15 mg tolvaptan which have to be 
taken once a day in the morning. </p>
<p>Method of administration </p>
<p>Swallow the tablets without chewing, with a glass of water. 
The morning dose is to be taken at least 30 minutes before the morning meal. The second daily dose can 
be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more Jinarc than you should 
If you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, drink plenty of water and contact your 
doctor or your local hospital immediately. Remember to take the medicine pack with you so that it is 
clear what you have taken. If you take the higher dose very late in the day you may have to go to the 
toilet at night more frequently. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Jinarc 
If you forget to take your medicine, you should take the dose as soon as you remember on the same day. 
If you do not take your tablets on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. DO NOT take a 
double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Jinarc 
If you stop taking this medicine your kidney cysts may grow as fast as they did before you started 
treatment with Jinarc. Therefore, you should only stop taking this medicine if you notice side effects 
requiring urgent medical attention (see section 4) or if your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
