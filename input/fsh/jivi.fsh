<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have 
* tightness in the chest, fall in blood pressure (often shown by feeling dizzy when getting up 
quickly), itchy nettle-rash, wheezing, feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a rare severe 
sudden allergic reaction to this medicine. Stop injecting the product immediately and get 
medical help at once if this occurs. 
* bleeding that is not being controlled with your usual dose of this medicine. Speak with your 
doctor immediately if this occurs. You may have developed antibodies against factor VIII 
(inhibitors) or antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG). These make Jivi less effective at 
preventing and controlling bleeding. Your doctor may carry out tests to confirm this and ensure 
that your Jivi dose provides adequate factor VIII levels. Your doctor may switch you back to 
your previous factor VIII treatment, if needed. 
* previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product. 
* heart disease or you are at risk of heart disease.<br />
* to use a central venous access device for this medicine. You may be at risk of device-related 
complications where the catheter is inserted including: 
  local infections<br />
  bacteria in the blood 
  a blood clot in the blood vessel </p>
<p>Children 
Jivi is not for use in children younger than 12 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Jivi 
Jivi is not known to influence or be influenced by other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Treatment with Jivi will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A. After suitable training patients or carers may be able to give Jivi at home. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. The dose of factor VIII units is measured in International Units (IU). </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding 
To treat a bleed, your doctor will calculate and adjust your dose and how often it should be given, 
depending on factors such as: 
* your weight 
* the severity of your haemophilia A 
* where the bleeding is and how serious it is 
* whether you have inhibitors and how high their level is 
* the factor VIII level that is needed. </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding 
To prevent bleeding your doctor will select an appropriate dose and frequency depending on your 
need: 
* 45 60 IU per kg body weight every 5 days or 
* 60 IU per kg body weight every 7 days or 
* 30 40 IU per kg body weight two times per week. </p>
<p>Laboratory tests 
Laboratory tests at suitable intervals help to ensure you always have adequate factor VIII levels. For 
major surgery in particular, your blood clotting must be closely monitored. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
Usually Jivi treatment for haemophilia is needed lifelong. </p>
<p>How Jivi is given 
Jivi is injected into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort level. 
The maximum rate is 2.5 mL per minute. Jivi should be used within 3 hours after reconstitution. </p>
