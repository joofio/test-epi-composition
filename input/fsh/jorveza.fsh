<p>if you are allergic to budesonide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jorveza if you have: </p>
<p>tuberculosis </p>
<p>high blood pressure </p>
<p>diabetes, or if somebody in your family has diabetes </p>
<p>weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) </p>
<p>ulcers in the stomach or first part of the small intestine (peptic ulcer) </p>
<p>increased pressure in your eye (which can cause glaucoma) or eye problems such as clouding of 
the lens (cataracts) or if somebody in your family has glaucoma </p>
<p>liver disease. </p>
<p>If you have any of the conditions mentioned above you may be at increased risk of side effects. Your 
doctor will decide on the appropriate measures and if it is still all right for you to take this medicine. </p>
<p>If you develop swelling of your face, particularly around your mouth (lips, tongue or throat) and/or 
difficulties to breathe or swallow, stop taking Jorveza and contact your doctor immediately. These 
may be signs of an allergic reaction, which may also include rash and itching (see also section 4). </p>
<p>Jorveza may cause typical side effects of corticosteroid medicines and may affect all parts of the body, 
particularly when you take this medicine at high doses and over a long time (see section 4). </p>
<p>Further precautions during treatment with Jorveza </p>
<p>Contact your doctor if you get blurred vision or have other problems with your vision. </p>
<p>Take the following precautions during treatment with Jorveza because your immune system may be 
weakened: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you get fungal infections in the mouth, throat and gullet or if you think you 
have any infection during treatment with this medicine. Symptoms of fungal infection can be 
white spots in the mouth and throat and difficulty in swallowing. The symptoms of some 
infections can be unusual or less noticeable. </p>
<p>Keep away from people who have chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles) if you have not had 
these infections. The effects of these illnesses can be much more severe during treatment with 
this medicine. If you do come into contact with chickenpox or shingles, see your doctor straight 
away. Please also report your vaccination status to your doctor. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have not yet had measles and/or if and when you have received your last 
vaccination for this disease. </p>
<p>If you need to be vaccinated please speak to your doctor first. </p>
<p>If you know that you are due to have an operation please tell your doctor that you are taking 
Jorveza. </p>
<p>Jorveza could affect the results of adrenal function tests (ACTH stimulation test) ordered by your 
doctor or in hospital. Tell your doctors that you are taking Jorveza before you have any tests. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Jorveza should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of this medicine 
in children younger than 18 years of age has not yet been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Jorveza 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some of these medicines may increase the effects of Jorveza and your doctor may wish to 
monitor you carefully if you are taking these medicines.<br />
In particular: </p>
<p>ketoconazole or itraconazole (to treat fungal infections) </p>
<p>clarithromycin, an antibiotic medicine used to treat infections </p>
<p>ritonavir and cobicistat (to treat HIV infections) </p>
<p>oestrogens (used for hormone replacement therapy or contraception) </p>
<p>cardiac glycosides such as digoxin (medicines used to treat heart conditions) </p>
<p>diuretics (to remove excess fluid from the body). </p>
<p>Jorveza with food and drink 
You should not drink grapefruit juice whilst you are taking this medicine as this can worsen its side 
effects. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Do not take this medicine during pregnancy without checking with your doctor first. </p>
<p>Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding unless you have checked with your doctor. 
Budesonide passes in small amounts into the breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide whether 
you should continue treatment and not breast-feed or if you should stop treatment over the period your 
baby is being breast-fed. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Jorveza is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Jorveza contains sodium 
This medicine contains 52 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per daily dose. This is 
equivalent to 2.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose for treatment of acute episodes is two 1 mg orodispersible tablets (2 mg 
budesonide) per day. Take one 1 mg orodispersible tablet in the morning and one 1 mg orodispersible 
tablet in the evening. </p>
<p>The recommended dose for prevention of further episodes is two 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets (1 mg 
budesonide) per day or two 1 mg orodispersible tablets (2 mg budesonide) per day, depending on your 
body s response to the treatment. Take one orodispersible tablet in the morning and one orodispersible 
tablet in the evening.  </p>
<p>Method of administration 
Take the orodispersible tablet immediately once removed from the blister package.  </p>
<p>Take the orodispersible tablet after a meal. </p>
<p>Place the orodispersible tablet on the tip of your tongue and close your mouth. Press it gently against 
the roof of your mouth with your tongue until it has disintegrated completely (this usually takes at 
least two minutes but may take up to 20 minutes). Swallow the disintegrated material with saliva little 
by little, as the orodispersible tablet breaks up. 
Do NOT take any liquid with the orodispersible tablet. </p>
<p>Do not chew or swallow the undisintegrated orodispersible tablet. </p>
<p>Do not eat, drink, brush your teeth or rinse your mouth for at least 30 minutes after you have taken the 
orodispersible tablet. Do not use any oral solutions, sprays or chewable tablets for at least 30 minutes 
before or after administration of the orodispersible tablet. This will ensure that your medicine works 
properly.  </p>
<p>Kidney and liver problems<br />
If you have any problem with your kidney or liver, talk to your doctor. If you have a kidney problem, 
your doctor will decide if Jorveza is suitable for you. In case your kidney problems are severe, you 
should not take Jorveza. If you have any liver disease, you should not take Jorveza. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
Initially, your treatment should last about 6 to 12 weeks.<br />
After treatment of the acute episode, your doctor will decide how long and with which dose you are to 
continue the treatment, depending on your condition and your response to the treatment. </p>
<p>If you take more Jorveza than you should 
If you have taken more orodispersible tablets than you should, take your next dose as prescribed. Do 
not take a smaller amount. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are in doubt. Take the carton and this 
leaflet with you if possible.  </p>
<p>If you forget to take Jorveza 
If you miss a dose, just take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Jorveza 
Speak to your doctor if you want to interrupt or end your treatment early. It is important that you do 
not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor. Keep taking your medicine until your 
doctor tells you to stop, even if you feel better. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
