infection: dolutegravir and rilpivirine. Dolutegravir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called 
integrase inhibitors (INIs), and rilpivirine belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). </p>
<p>Juluca is used to treat HIV in adults aged 18 years and over who are taking other antiretroviral medicines and 
whose HIV-1 infection is under control for at least 6 months. Juluca may replace your current antiretroviral 
medicines. </p>
<p>Juluca keeps the amount of HIV virus in your body at a low level. This helps maintain the number of CD4 
cells in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that are important in helping your body to fight 
infection. </p>         </div>"""

Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines in the following list: </p>
<ul>

hours before you take Juluca, or for at least 4 hours after you take it (see also section 3,  How to take 
Juluca ) </li>
<li>calcium supplements, iron supplements and multivitamins must be taken at the same time as 
Juluca with a meal. If you can t take these supplements at the same time as Juluca, do not take a 
calcium supplement, iron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take Juluca, 
or for at least 4 hours after you take it (see also section 3,  How to take Juluca ) </li>
<li>medicines called H2 receptor antagonists (for example cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine,

not take these medicines during the 12 hours before you take Juluca, or for at least 4 hours after you 
take it (see also section 3,  How to take Juluca ) </li>
<li>any medicines to treat HIV infection </li>
<li>rifabutin, to treat tuberculosis (TB) and other bacterial infections. If you take rifabutin, your doctor

need extra check ups. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby:  </p>
<p>Use of Juluca is not recommended. Ask your doctor for advice.  </p>
<p>Taking Juluca at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may also increase 
the risk of a type of birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed spinal cord).  </p>
<p>If you could get pregnant while receiving Juluca:  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom or pills.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will 
review your treatment. Do not stop taking Juluca without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and 
your unborn child.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to 
the baby in breast milk.  </p>
<p>A small amount of the ingredient, dolutegravir, in Juluca can pass into your breast milk. It is not known 
whether the other ingredient, rilpivirine, can pass into your breast milk.  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon 
as possible.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Juluca can make you dizzy, tired or drowsy and have other side effects that make you less alert. </p>
<p>Don t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure you re not affected.  </p>

<p>Allergic reactions 
Juluca contains dolutegravir. Dolutegravir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity 
reaction. This is an uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) reaction in people taking dolutegravir. If 
you get any of the following symptoms: 
  skin rash 
  a high temperature (fever) 
  lack of energy (fatigue) 
  swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing 
  muscle or joint aches 
  See a doctor straight away. Your doctor may decide to carry out tests to check your liver, kidneys or 
blood, and may tell you to stop taking Juluca. </p>
<p>Very common side effects<br />
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people: 
  headache 
  dizziness 
  diarrhoea 
  feeling sick (nausea)<br />
  difficulty in sleeping (insomnia). </p>
<p>Very common side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
  increase in the level of liver enzymes (aminotransferases) 
  increase in cholesterol 
  increase in pancreatic amylase (a digestive enzyme). </p>
<p>Common side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 10 people: 
  loss of appetite 
  rash 
  itching (pruritus) 
  being sick (vomiting) 
  stomach (abdominal) pain or discomfort 
  weight gain 
  wind (flatulence) 
  feeling drowsy 
  sleep disorders 
  abnormal dreams 
  lack of energy (fatigue) 
  depression (feelings of deep sadness and unworthiness) 
  depressed mood 
  anxiety 
  dry mouth. </p>
<p>Common side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
  increase in the level of enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase). 
  decreased number of platelets, which are involved in blood clotting 
  low white blood cell count 
  decrease in haemoglobin<br />
  increase in triglycerides (a type of fat) 
  increase in lipase (an enzyme involved in breaking down fats)<br />
  increase in bilirubin (a test of liver function) in your blood. </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 100 people: 
  allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction (see  allergic reactions  earlier in this section) 
  inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)<br />
  suicidal thoughts and behaviours (particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health 
problems before) 
  panic attack 
  joint pain 
  muscle pain. </p>
<p>Rare side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: 
  liver failure (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes or unusually dark 
urine). 
  suicide (particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before) </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any mental health problems (see also other mental 
health problems above). </p>
<p>Not known<br />
Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data: 
  signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection, for example fever, chills, sweats (immune 
reactivation syndrome). </p>
<p>Other possible side effects 
People taking combination therapy for HIV may get other side effects. 
Symptoms of infection and inflammation  </p>
<p>People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop 
serious infections (opportunistic infections). Symptoms of infection may develop, caused by old, hidden 
infections flaring up again as the body fights them. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the 
following: 
  headache 
  stomach ache 
  difficulty breathing. 
In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune 
disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking 
medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
  palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
  hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) 
  weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately. Don t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor s 
advice. </p>
<p>Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems </p>
<p>Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more 
likely to get this condition: 
  if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
  if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
  if they drink alcohol 
  if their immune systems are very weak 
  if they are overweight. </p>
<p>Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
  stiffness in the joints 
  aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
  difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects<br />
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is 
partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor 
will test for these changes.<br />
Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed 
in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix 
V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
