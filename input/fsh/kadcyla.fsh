  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Kadcyla is 
Kadcyla contains the active substance trastuzumab emtansine, which is made up of two parts that are 
linked together: 
* trastuzumab - a monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to an antigen (a target protein) called 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts on the surface 
of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When trastuzumab binds to HER2 it can 
stop the cancer cells growth and cause them to die. 
* DM1   an anti-cancer substance that becomes active once Kadcyla enters the cancer cell.  </p>
<p>What Kadcyla is used for 
Kadcyla is used to treat breast cancer in adults when: 
* the cancer cells have many HER2 proteins on them - your doctor will test your cancer cells for 
this.<br />
* you have already received the medicine trastuzumab and a medicine known as a taxane. 
* the cancer has spread to areas near the breast or to other parts of your body (metastasized) 
* the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and treatment is going to be given after surgery 
(treatment after surgery is called adjuvant therapy). </p>         </div>"""

in section 6).<br />
You should not be given Kadcyla if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
nurse before you are given Kadcyla. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Kadcyla if: 
* you have ever had a serious infusion-related reaction from using trastuzumab characterised by 
symptoms such as flushing, chills, fever, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat 
or a drop in blood pressure. 
* you are receiving treatment with blood thinning medicines (e.g. warfarin, heparin). 
* you have any history of liver problems. Your doctor will check your blood to test your liver 
function before and regularly during treatment </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are 
given Kadcyla. </p>
<p>Look out for side effects 
Kadcyla can make some existing conditions worse, or cause side effects. See section 4 for more details 
about what side effects to look out for. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects 
while you are given Kadcyla: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Breathing problems: Kadcyla can cause serious breathing problems such as shortness of breath 
(either at rest or while performing any type of activity) and cough.  These may be signs of 
inflammation of your lung, which may be serious, and even fatal. If you develop lung disease your 
doctor may stop treatment with this medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver problems: Kadcyla can cause inflammation or damage to cells in the liver that can stop the 
liver from functioning normally. Inflamed or injured liver cells may leak higher than normal 
amounts of certain substances (liver enzymes) into the bloodstream, resulting in elevated liver 
enzymes in blood tests. In most cases you will not have any symptoms. Some symptoms could be 
yellowing of your skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice). Your doctor will check your blood to 
test your liver function before and regularly during treatment. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another rare abnormality that can occur in the liver is a condition known as nodular regenerative 
hyperplasia (NRH). This abnormality causes the structure of the liver to change and can change 
how the liver functions. Over time, this may lead to symptoms such as a bloated sensation or 
swelling of the abdomen due to fluid accumulation or bleeding from abnormal blood vessels in the 
gullet or rectum. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heart problems: Kadcyla can weaken the heart muscle. When the heart muscle is weak, patients 
may develop symptoms such as shortness of breath at rest or when sleeping, chest pain, swollen 
legs or arms, and a sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeats. Your doctor will check your heart 
function before and regularly during treatment. You should tell your doctor immediately if you 
notice any of the above symptoms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infusion-related reactions or allergic reactions: Kadcyla can cause flushing, shivering fits, 
fever, trouble breathing, low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, sudden swelling of your face, tongue, 
or trouble swallowing during the infusion or after the infusion on the first day of treatment. Your 
doctor or nurse will check to see whether you are having any of these side effects. If you develop a 
reaction, they will slow down or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the 
side effects. The infusion may be continued after the symptoms improve. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bleeding problems: Kadcyla can lower the number of platelets in your blood. Platelets help your 
blood to clot so you might get unexpected bruising or bleeding (such as nose bleeds, bleeding 
from gums). Your doctor will check your blood regularly for decreased platelets. You should tell 
your doctor immediately if you notice any unexpected bruising or bleeding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neurological problems: Kadcyla can damage nerves. You may experience tingling, pain, 
numbness, itching, crawling sensation, pins and needles in your hands and feet. Your doctor will 
monitor you for signs and symptoms of neurological problems.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Injection site reaction: If you get a burning sensation, feel pain or tenderness at the infusion 
site during the infusion, this could indicate that Kadcyla has leaked outside the blood vessel. 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately. If Kadcyla has leaked outside the blood vessel, increased 
pain, discoloration, blistering and sloughing of your skin (skin necrosis) can occur within days 
or weeks after the infusion. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of the side effects above. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Kadcyla is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. This is because there is no 
information on how well it works in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kadcyla 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking: 
* any medicines to thin your blood such as warfarin or decrease the ability to form blood clot such 
as aspirin 
* medicines for fungal infections called ketoconazole, itraconazole or voriconazole 
* antibiotics for infections called clarithromycin or telithromycin 
* medicines for HIV called atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir or saquinavir. 
* medicine for depression called nefazodone 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are 
given Kadcyla.   </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Kadcyla is not recommended if you are pregnant because this medicine may cause harm to the unborn 
baby.<br />
<em> Tell your doctor before using Kadcyla if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to have a baby. 
* Use effective contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while you are being treated with Kadcyla. 
Talk to your doctor about the best contraception for you. 
* You should continue to take your contraception for at least 7 months after your last dose of 
Kadcyla. Talk to your doctor before stopping your contraception.<br />
</em> Male patients or their female partners should also use effective contraception.<br />
* If you do become pregnant during treatment with Kadcyla, tell your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Kadcyla. Also you should not breast-feed for 7 
months after your last infusion of Kadcyla. It is not known whether the ingredients in Kadcyla pass 
into breast-milk. Talk to your doctor about this. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that Kadcyla will affect your ability to drive, cycle, use tools or machines. If you 
experience flushing, shivering fits, fever, trouble breathing, low blood pressure or a rapid heartbeat 
(infusion-related reaction), blurred vision, tiredness, headache, or dizziness, do not drive, cycle, use 
tools or machines until these reactions stop. </p>
