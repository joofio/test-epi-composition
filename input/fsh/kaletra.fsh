Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kaletra.
Important information</p>
<p>People taking Kaletra may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease 
and AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while 
taking Kaletra.<br />
Tell your doctor if you or your child have/had</p>
<p>Haemophilia type A and B as Kaletra might increase the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving Kaletra.</p>
<p>A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic 
hepatitis B or C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects.
Tell your doctor if you or your child experience</p>
<p>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in 
the legs and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels.</p>
<p>Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels 
in the blood.</p>
<p>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the 
blood) have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and 
these symptoms may suggest this condition.</p>
<p>In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and 
symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune 
response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious 
symptoms.</p>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment.</p>
<p>Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression (reduction in the activity of the immune system), higher body mass index, 
among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.  </p>
<p>Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines.  On 
rare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious. </p>
<p>Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats. Kaletra 
may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart.  These changes 
may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).

blood pressure in the pulmonary artery) (see also Do not take Kaletra section above).</p>
<p>If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and Kaletra together, you may be at risk of side effects such as 
low blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours.<br />
If an erection lasts longer than 4 hours, you should get medical help immediately to avoid 
permanent damage to your penis.  Your doctor can explain these symptoms to you.
Contraceptives</p>
<p>If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent 
pregnancy, you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as 
Kaletra may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you are planning to have a baby, you are pregnant or think you 
may be pregnant.</p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your 
doctor as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this 
medicine because it contains propylene glycol and alcohol.  </p>
<p>It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants because there is 
a possibility that the baby can be infected with HIV through your breast milk.
Driving or using machines
Kaletra has not specifically been tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or operate 
machines.  Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you experience any side effects (e.g. nausea) 
that impact your ability to do so safely.  Instead, contact your doctor.
Kaletra contains 42% v/v alcohol.  The amount of alcohol in this medicine may affect your ability to 
drive or use machines and may affect your judgement and reaction times.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Kaletra
Kaletra contains 42% v/v alcohol and 15% propylene glycol w/v.  Each 1 ml of Kaletra oral solution 
contains 356.3 mg of alcohol and 152.7 mg of propylene glycol.  Alcohol and propylene glycol are 
potentially harmful for those suffering from liver disease, kidney disease, alcoholism, epilepsy, brain 
injury or disease, as well as for pregnant women and children.  They may modify or increase the effect 
of other medicines.
At the recommended adult dose(s) of this medicine, the estimated blood alcohol concentration in your 
body is about 0.002 - 0.01 g/dL.  This is similar to an adult drinking 4-22 ml of beer or 1-4 ml of wine.<br />
Other medicines may also contain alcohol and alcohol may be consumed in food and drinks.  The 
combined effects may lead to increased blood alcohol levels and increase the side effects of alcohol.
This medicinal product contains up to 0.8 g of fructose per dose when taken according to the dosage 
recommendations.  Unsuitable in hereditary fructose intolerance.  Due to the possibility of undetected 
fructose intolerance, this medicinal product should only be given to babies and infants after 
consultation with a doctor.
Kaletra contains glycerol which is harmful in high doses.  Can cause headache and stomach upset and 
diarrhoea.
Kaletra contains polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil.  This may cause nausea, vomiting, colic, severe 
purgation at high doses.  It should not be given when intestinal obstruction is present.
Kaletra contains potassium as acesulfame potassium, which may be harmful to people on a low 
potassium diet.  High potassium in the blood can cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.
Kaletra contains sodium as saccharin sodium, sodium chloride and sodium citrate, which may be 
harmful to people on a low sodium diet.
Kaletra contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 ml, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .</p>         </div>"""
