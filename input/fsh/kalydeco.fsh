  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Kalydeco contains the active substance ivacaftor. Ivacaftor acts at the level of the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein that forms a channel at the cell surface that 
allows the movement of particles such as chloride in and out of the cell. Due to mutations in the CFTR 
gene (see below), chloride movement is reduced in those with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ivacaftor helps 
certain abnormal CFTR proteins open more often to improve chloride movement in and out of the cell. </p>
<p>Kalydeco tablets are indicated:<br />
* As monotherapy for patients aged 6 years and older and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the following gating mutations in 
the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for patients aged 6 years and older with CF who 
have two F508del mutations in the CFTR gene (homozygous for the F508del mutation) or who 
have an F508del mutation and certain other second mutations that result in reduced amount 
and/or function of the CFTR protein (heterozygous for the F508del mutation with a residual 
function (RF) mutation). If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to be taken with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. It contains important information 
about how to take these two medicines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for patients aged 6 years and over 
who have CF, with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. If you have been prescribed 
Kalydeco to be taken with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. 
It contains important information about how to take these two medicines. </p>

<li>if you are allergic to ivacaftor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kalydeco. </p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems or have previously had them. Your doctor may 
need to adjust your dose. </li>
<li>
<p>Increased liver enzymes in the blood have been seen in some people receiving Kalydeco (alone 
or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Tell your doctor 
right away if you have any of these symptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems: 
  Pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area 
  Yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes 
  Loss of appetite 
  Nausea or vomiting 
  Dark urine </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment, 
particularly during the first year and especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in 
the past. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems or have previously had them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kalydeco  is not recommended if you have undergone an organ transplant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are using hormonal contraception   for example, women using the 
contraceptive pill. This may mean you are more likely to get a rash while taking Kalydeco in 
combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has been noted in some 
children and adolescents treated with Kalydeco (alone or in combination with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Your doctor may perform some eye 
examinations prior to and during treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kalydeco  should only be used if you have one of the mutations in the CFTR gene indicated in 
section 1 (What Kalydeco is and what it is used for). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under 4 months of age as it is not known if ivacaftor is safe and 
effective in these children. </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor to children under 6 years of age or 
in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to children under 2 years of age as it is not known 
if they are safe and effective for them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kalydeco </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Some medicines can affect how Kalydeco works or make side effects more likely. In particular, tell 
your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may decide to adjust your 
dose or that you need extra check-ups. </p>
<ul>
<li>Antifungal medicines (used for the treatment of fungal infections). These include fluconazole, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. </li>
<li>Antibiotic medicines (used for the treatment of bacterial infections). These include 
clarithromycin, erythromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin, and telithromycin. </li>
<li>Epilepsy medicines (used for the treatment of epileptic seizures or fits). These include 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.  </li>
<li>Herbal medicines. These include St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum). </li>
<li>Immunosuppressants (used after an organ transplantation). These include ciclosporin, 
everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus.  </li>

<li>Medicines for lowering blood pressure. These include verapamil. </li>
</ul>
<p>Kalydeco with food and drink </p>
<p>Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit during treatment as these may increase the side effects of 
Kalydeco by increasing the amount of ivacaftor in your body. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It may be better to avoid using Kalydeco during 
pregnancy, if possible, and your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether ivacaftor is excreted in human milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking Kalydeco. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop 
breast-feeding or for you to stop ivacaftor therapy. Your doctor will take into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Kalydeco can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle or use machines. </p>
<p>Kalydeco contains lactose and sodium.  </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Kalydeco contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
