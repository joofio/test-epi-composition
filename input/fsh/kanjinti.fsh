  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>KANJINTI contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal 
antibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an 
antigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts on 
the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When trastuzumab binds to HER2 it 
stops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe KANJINTI for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: 
* You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2. * You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) 
with high levels of HER2. KANJINTI may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy 
medicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be 
prescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in combination 
with medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of HER2 and 
hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of 
female sex hormones). 
* You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with the 
other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. </p>         </div>"""

* you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen treatment. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor will closely supervise your therapy.  </p>
<p>Heart checks 
Treatment with KANJINTI alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever 
used an anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat 
cancer). The effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function 
will be checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with 
KANJINTI. If you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your 
heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment 
for heart failure or you may have to stop KANJINTI treatment. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given KANJINTI if: </p>
<ul>
<li>you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high 
blood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood 
pressure medicine. </li>
<li>you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines 
used to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle 
and increase the risk of heart problems with KANJINTI. </li>
<li>you suffer from breathlessness, especially if you are currently using a taxane. KANJINTI can 
cause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you 
are already breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment 
have died when they were given trastuzumab. </li>
<li>you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you receive KANJINTI with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an 
aromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient 
information leaflets for these products. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
KANJINTI is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and KANJINTI 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>It may take up to 7 months for KANJINTI to be removed from the body. Therefore, you should tell 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had KANJINTI if you start any new medicine in the 7 
months after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
* If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. 
* You should use effective contraception during treatment with KANJINTI and for at least 7 
months after KANJINTI treatment has ended. 
* Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking KANJINTI during pregnancy. In 
rare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby 
within the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. This condition 
may be harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not 
developing fully resulting in foetal death. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed your baby during KANJINTI therapy and for 7 months after the last dose, as 
KANJINTI may pass to your baby through your breast milk. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
KANJINTI may affect your ability to drive a car or use machines. If during treatment you experience 
symptoms, such as dizziness, sleepiness, chills or fever, you should not drive or use machines until 
these symptoms disappear. </p>
<p>Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Before starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only 
patients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with KANJINTI. KANJINTI should only be 
given by a doctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for 
you. The dose of KANJINTI depends on your body weight. </p>
<p>It is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation is being given as 
prescribed. KANJINTI intravenous formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an 
intravenous infusion only. </p>
<p>KANJINTI intravenous formulation is given as an intravenous infusion ( drip ) directly into your 
veins. The first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health 
professional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. If the first dose is well tolerated 
the next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under  Warnings and precautions ). The 
number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. Your doctor will 
discuss this with you. </p>
<p>In order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine 
being prepared and given is KANJINTI (trastuzumab) and not another trastuzumab-containing product 
(e.g. trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab deruxtecan). </p>
<p>For early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, KANJINTI is given 
every 3 weeks. KANJINTI may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. </p>
<p>If you stop using KANJINTI 
Do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the 
right time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your 
medicine work as well as it can. </p>
<p>It may take up to 7 months for KANJINTI to be removed from your body. Therefore your doctor may 
decide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, KANJINTI can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of 
these side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. </p>
<p>During a KANJINTI infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very 
common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick 
(nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing 
difficulties, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or 
irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these symptoms can 
be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>These effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion ( drip  into your vein) and during the 
first few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a 
health care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion 
and for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or 
stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion may be 
continued after the symptoms improve. </p>
<p>Occasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, 
contact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. </p>
<p>Serious side effects 
Other side effects can occur at any time during treatment with trastuzumab, not just related to an 
infusion. Tell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects: </p>
<ul>
<li>Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has 
stopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to 
heart failure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. This 
can lead to symptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid 
retention (swelling) in the legs or arms, palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart beat) (see 
section 2. Heart checks). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your 
doctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment 
characterised by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of 
calcium). Symptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and 
confusion), heart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, 
vomiting or diarrhoea and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with KANJINTI has finished, you 
should see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with KANJINTI. </p>
