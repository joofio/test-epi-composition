occurring enzyme lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), which the body uses to breakdown fats. It is used to 
treat patients of all ages with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL deficiency). </p>
<p>LAL deficiency is a genetic disease that leads to liver damage, high blood cholesterol, and other 
complications due to a build-up of certain types of fats (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides). </p>
<p>How KANUMA works 
This medicine is an enzyme replacement therapy. This means that it replaces the missing or defective 
LAL enzyme in patients with LAL deficiency. This medicine works by lowering the build-up of fat 
that causes medical complications, including impaired growth, liver damage and heart complications. 
It also improves blood levels of fats, including elevated LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides.  </p>         </div>"""

- If you or your child has experienced life-threatening allergic reactions to sebelipase alfa that 
cannot be managed when you or your child receives the medicine again, or to egg or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
- If treated with KANUMA, you or your child may experience a side effect while you or your 
child is being given the medicine or during the hours following the infusion (see section 4). 
This is known as an infusion reaction which can sometimes be severe, and may include an </p>
<p>allergic reaction that could be life-threatening and require medical treatment. The first time that 
you or your child are given KANUMA you should be observed by a healthcare professional for 
1 hour to watch for any signs of an infusion reaction. If you or your child experiences a 
severe infusion reaction like this, seek immediate medical attention. If you or your child has 
an infusion reaction you or your child may be given additional medicines to treat or help 
prevent future reactions. These medicines may include antihistamines, fever-reducing 
medicines and/or corticosteroids (a type of anti-inflammatory medicines). 
If the infusion reaction is severe, your doctor may stop KANUMA infusion and start giving you 
or your child appropriate medical treatment. 
- The development of blood proteins against KANUMA, also called anti-drug antibodies, may 
occur during the treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience decreased efficacy with 
KANUMA 
- This medicine may contain egg proteins. If you or your child has an egg allergy or a history of 
allergies to eggs, tell your doctor or nurse (see You must not be given KANUMA).  </p>
<p>Other medicines and KANUMA 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of sebelipase alfa in pregnant women. As a precautionary measure, you 
should not be given KANUMA if you are pregnant.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether sebelipase alfa passes into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-
feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or 
whether to stop taking KANUMA, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the 
benefit of KANUMA to the mother. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
KANUMA may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse effects of 
sebelipase alfa include dizziness which could affect the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>KANUMA contains sodium<br />
This medicine, when diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion for 
intravenous administration contains 33 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) at the 
recommended dose. This is equivalent to 1.7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of 
sodium for an adult. Tell your doctor if you or your child is on a controlled sodium diet.  </p>         </div>"""
