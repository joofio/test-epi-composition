  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Karvea belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-II 
is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. 
This results in an increase in blood pressure. Karvea prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these 
receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. Karvea slows the 
decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p>Karvea is used in adult patients 
* to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) 
* to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory 
evidence of impaired kidney function. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to irbesartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
* if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Karvea in early pregnancy <br />
see pregnancy section) 
* if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.  </p>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Karvea and if any of the following apply to you: 
* if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea 
* if you suffer from kidney problems 
* if you suffer from heart problems 
* if you receive Karvea for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may perform regular 
blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor kidney function 
* if you develop low blood sugar levels (symptoms may include sweating, weakness, hunger, 
dizziness, trembling, headache, flushing or paleness, numbness, having a fast, pounding 
heartbeat), particularly if you are being treated for diabetes. 
* if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics 
* if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
 * an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. * aliskiren 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading  Do not take Karvea . </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Karvea is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy 
have not yet been fully established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Karvea 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: 
 If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not take 
Karvea  and  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>You may need to have blood checks if you take: 
* potassium supplements 
* salt substitutes containing potassium 
* potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) 
* medicines containing lithium 
* repaglinide (medication used for lowering blood sugar levels) </p>
<p>If you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan 
may be reduced. </p>
<p>Karvea with food and drink 
Karvea can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Karvea before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Karvea. Karvea is not recommended 
in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious 
harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Karvea is not recommended 
for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish 
to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Karvea is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness or 
weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your 
doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Karvea contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some 
sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>Karvea contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is 
to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Method of administration 
Karvea is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of water). 
You can take Karvea with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about the same time each

300 mg (four tablets a day) once daily depending on blood pressure response. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease 
In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, 300 mg (four tablets a day) once daily 
is the preferred maintenance dose for the treatment of associated kidney disease. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctor may advise a lower dose, especially when starting treatment in certain patients such as 
those on haemodialysis, or those over the age of 75 years. </p>
<p>The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Karvea should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets, contact 
your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you take more Karvea than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Karvea 
If you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 10 people): dizziness, feeling sick/vomiting, fatigue and blood

from a lying or sitting position, pain in joints or muscles and decreased levels of a protein in the
