included in the carton of the pen.

sure that there are at least 28 days remaining before its expiry date. Insert the cartridge into the
pen before the first use as detailed in the pen instructions. Write down the batch (Lot) number of
each cartridge and its first injection date on a calendar. The date of first injection should also be
recorded on the outer carton of Kauliv cartridge (see the provided space on the box:  First use ).
-
After inserting a new cartridge and before the first injection from this cartridge, prime the pen
according to the instructions which are provided with the pen IFU. Please ensure to prime
before each dose as per the instructions given in pen IFU.
Injecting Kauliv 
-
Before you inject Kauliv, clean your skin where you intend to inject (thigh or abdomen) as
instructed by your doctor.
-
Gently hold a fold of cleansed skin and insert the needle straight into the skin. Press the push
button and hold it pressed in until the dose indication has returned to the start position.
-
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for ten seconds to make sure that you receive
the whole dose.
-
As soon as you have finished the injection, attach the outer needle protective cap on the pen
needle and screw the cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle.
-
Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen.
If you use more Kauliv than you should<br />
If, by mistake, you have used more Kauliv than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. The 
expected effects of overdose include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache.<br />
If you forget to use Kauliv 
If you forget an injection or cannot use your medicine at your usual time, inject it as soon as possible 
on that day. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not take more than one 
injection in the same day. </p>
<p>If you stop using Kauliv 
If you are considering stopping Kauliv treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor 
will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Kauliv. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  </p>
<p>Kauliv is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired persons without the assistance
