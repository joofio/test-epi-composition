hormones (mineralocorticoids) that can damage your kidneys and heart. </p>
<p>Kerendia is used for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease (with abnormal presence of 
the protein albumin in the urine) associated with type 2 diabetes.<br />
Chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition. Your kidneys keep getting worse at removing waste 
and fluids from your blood. 
Type 2 diabetes is when your body cannot keep your blood sugar levels normal. Your body does not 
produce enough of the hormone insulin or cannot use the insulin properly. This leads to a high level of 
sugar in your blood. </p>         </div>"""
