Kesimpta contains the active substance ofatumumab. Ofatumumab belongs to a group of medicines 
called monoclonal antibodies. </p>
<p>What Kesimpta is used for 
Kesimpta is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). </p>
<p>How Kesimpta works 
Kesimpta works by attaching to a target called CD20 on the surface of B cells. B cells are a type of 
white blood cell which are part of the immune system (the body s defences). In multiple sclerosis, the 
immune system attacks the protective layer around nerve cells. B cells are involved in this process. 
Kesimpta targets and removes the B cells and thereby reduces the chance of a relapse, relieves 
symptoms and slows down the progression of the disease. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to ofatumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have been told that you have severe problems with your immune system. 
- if you are suffering from a severe infection. 
- if you have cancer. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Kesimpta 
- Kesimpta may cause the hepatitis B virus to become active again. Your doctor will perform a 
blood test to check if you are at risk of hepatitis B infection. If this shows that you have had 
hepatitis B or are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus, your doctor will ask you to see a specialist. 
- Before you start treatment with Kesimpta, your doctor may check your immune system. 
- If you have an infection, your doctor may decide that you cannot be given Kesimpta or may 
delay your treatment with Kesimpta until the infection is resolved. 
- Your doctor will check if you need any vaccinations before you start your treatment with 
Kesimpta. If you need a type of vaccine called a live or live-attenuated vaccine, it should be 
given at least 4 weeks before you start Kesimpta treatment. Other types of vaccines should be 
given at least 2 weeks before you start Kesimpta treatment. </p>
<p>While using Kesimpta 
Tell your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a general injection-related reaction or a local injection-site reaction. These are the 
most common side effects of Kesimpta treatment and are described in section 4. They usually 
occur in the 24 hours after Kesimpta is injected, in particular after the first injection. The first 
injection should take place under the guidance of a healthcare professional. </li>
<li>if you have an infection. You may get infections more easily or an infection you already have 
may get worse. This is because the immune cells that Kesimpta targets also help to fight 
infection. Infections could be serious and sometimes even life-threatening. </li>
<li>if you plan to have any vaccinations. Your doctor will tell you whether the vaccination you need 
is a live vaccine, a live-attenuated vaccine, or another type of vaccine. You should not be given 
live or live-attenuated vaccines during treatment with Kesimpta as this may result in infection. 
Other types of vaccines may work less well if they are given during treatment with Kesimpta. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get any of the following during your treatment with Kesimpta, 
because they could be signs of a serious condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have rash, hives, trouble breathing, swelling of the face, eyelids, lips, mouth, tongue or 
throat, chest tightness, or feel faint. These could be signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction. </li>
<li>if you think your multiple sclerosis is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you 
notice any new or unusual symptoms. These effects may indicate a rare brain disorder called 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by a virus infection. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because Kesimpta has not 
yet been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kesimpta 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are taking, have recently taken or might take medicines that affect the immune system. 
This is because these may have an added effect on the immune system. </li>
<li>if you plan to have any vaccinations (see  Warnings and Precautions  above). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
You should avoid becoming pregnant while using Kesimpta and for 6 months after you stop using it. </p>
<p>If there is a possibility that you could become pregnant you should use an effective birth control 
method during treatment and for 6 months after stopping Kesimpta. Ask your doctor about the 
available options. </p>
<p>If you do become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment or within 6 months after the 
last dose, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of 
Kesimpta on pregnancy. This is because Kesimpta can reduce the number of immune cells (B cells) in 
both the mother and the unborn baby. Your doctor should report your pregnancy to Novartis. You can 
also report your pregnancy by contacting the local representative of Novartis (see section 6), in 
addition to contacting your doctor. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Kesimpta can pass into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks before breast-
feeding your baby while using Kesimpta. </p>
<p>Vaccination of newborn babies 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before vaccinating your newborn baby if you have used 
Kesimpta during your pregnancy (see  Warnings and precautions  above). </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Kesimpta is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Kesimpta contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you have questions about how long to use Kesimpta, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>If you use more Kesimpta than you should 
If you have injected too much Kesimpta, contact your doctor right away. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Kesimpta 
To get the full benefit of Kesimpta, it is important that you have every injection on time. </p>
<p>If you have forgotten an injection of Kesimpta, inject yourself as soon as possible. Do not wait until 
the next scheduled dose. The timing of future injections should then be calculated from the day you 
injected this dose and not based on the original schedule (see also  How much Kesimpta to use and 
how often to use it  above). </p>
<p>If you stop using Kesimpta 
Do not stop using Kesimpta or change your dose without talking with your doctor. </p>
<p>Some side effects can be related to a low level of B cells in your blood. After you stop treatment with 
Kesimpta your blood level of B cells will gradually increase to normal. This can take several months. 
During this time some side effects described in this leaflet may still occur. </p>
