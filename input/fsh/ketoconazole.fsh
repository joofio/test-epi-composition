adults and adolescents above the age of 12 years. </p>
<p>Cushing s syndrome is caused by overproduction of a hormone called cortisol which is produced by the adrenal 
glands. Ketoconazole HRA is able to block the activity of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of cortisol 
and consequently is able to decrease the over-production of cortisol by your body and to improve the symptoms 
of Cushing s syndrome. </p>         </div>"""
