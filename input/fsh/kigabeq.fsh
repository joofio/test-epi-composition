- if your child is allergic to vigabatrin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your child’s doctor before you give Kigabeq if your child: 
- has or has had depression or any other psychiatric illness in the past 
- has had any kidney problems as he/she could develop symptoms like sedation or confusion<br />
- has had any eye problems. </p>
<p>Visual field loss (loss of sight from the edges of your child’s field of vision) may occur during 
treatment with vigabatrin. You should discuss this possibility with the doctor before your child begins 
treatment and the doctor will tell you how to detect this side effect. This visual field loss may be 
severe and permanent, so it must be detected early to avoid progression. Worsening of visual field loss 
may continue after stopping treatment. It is important that you tell the doctor promptly if there is any 
change in your child’s vision. The doctor will check your child’s visual field before your child starts 
taking vigabatrin and carry on checking it at regular intervals during the treatment. </p>
<p>If your child develops symptoms like sleepiness, reduced consciousness and movements (stupor) or 
confusion, tell your child’s doctor who may reduce the dose or stop Kigabeq treatment. </p>
<p>A small number of people being treated with epilepsy medicines such as vigabatrin have had thoughts 
of harming or killing themselves. Look for symptoms suggestive of such thoughts: disturbed sleep, 
loss of appetite or weight, isolation, loss of interest for favorite activities. 
If at any time your child has had these symptoms, immediately contact child’s doctor. </p>
<p>Movement disorders can occur in young infants treated for infantile spasms (West’s syndrome). If you 
see unusual movements in your child, tell your child’s doctor who may change the treatment. </p>
<p>Tell your child’s doctor if your child has had or is going to perform laboratory tests because this 
medicine may lead to abnormal results. </p>
<p>You must speak to your child’s doctor if your child’s condition does not improve within a month of 
starting vigabatrin.  </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give this medicine to children less than 1 month of age or more than 7 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kigabeq 
Tell your child’s doctor if the child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Kigabeq should not be used in combination with other medicines that may have side effects related to 
the eye. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
This medicine is not intended for use in women of child-bearing potential or in breast-feeding women. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your child should not ride a bicycle, climb or take part in hazardous activity if the child has symptoms 
like drowsiness or dizziness with Kigabeq. Visual disorders, which can affect the ability to cycle, 
climb or take part in hazardous activity, have occurred in some patients taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Kigabeq contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dose 
Never change the dose yourself. The doctor works out the dose individually for your child, taking 
account of the child’s body weight. </p>
<p>Kigabeq is available as 100 mg or 500 mg tablets which can be given together to make up the right 
dose for your child. Always check the label and the size of the tablets to make sure you are giving the 
right dose. </p>
<p>In infantile spasms (West’s Syndrome), the recommended starting dose is 50 milligrams per kilogram 
bodyweight daily. In resistant partial epilepsy (focal onset seizures), the recommended starting dose is 
40 milligrams per kilogram daily. The doctor will adjust the dose during treatment as necessary. If 
your child has kidney problems, the doctor may prescribe a smaller dose. </p>

<p>How to give this medicine 
Ask your child’s doctor to show you how to give this medicine. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. </p>
<p>Kigabeq is to be given by mouth and may be taken before or after meals. The tablet can be cut into 
equal halves. </p>
<p>Use only water to prepare solution. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pour one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water into a drinking glass or beaker </li>
<li>Add the right dose of Kigabeq tablets (as whole or half tablets) to the water </li>
<li>Wait until the tablet has broken down completely. This takes less than a minute but you can speed 
it up by stirring the mixture gently by hand </li>
<li>The mixture will be whitish and cloudy. This is normal and the cloudiness is because the tablet 
contains some excipients that do not dissolve completely </li>
<li>Give the mixture straightway to your child direct from the drinking glass or beaker </li>
<li>If your child cannot drink from the glass or beaker then you can use an oral syringe to gently 
squirt the mixture into your child's mouth, taking care not to cause choking: sit just in front and 
below your child in order that he/she has the head leaning forward and administer the mixture 
against his cheek </li>
<li>Rinse the glass or beaker with one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water and give this to 
your child to make sure that the child receives all the medicine </li>
<li>If the child cannot swallow, the mixture can be given through a gastric tube, using a suitable 
syringe. The tube should be rinsed with 10 ml of water </li>
</ul>
<p>If your child takes too much Kigabeq 
If your child accidentally takes too many Kigabeq tablets, tell the doctor immediately or go to your 
nearest hospital or poison information centre. Possible signs of overdose include drowsiness or 
reduced level of consciousness. </p>
<p>If you forget to give your child Kigabeq 
If you forget to give your child a dose, give the dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for 
the next dose, just give one dose. Do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.  </p>
<p>If you stop giving Kigabeq to your child 
Do not stop giving this medicine without talking to your child’s doctor. If the doctor decides to stop 
the treatment you will be advised to gradually reduce the dose. Do not stop suddenly as this may cause 
your child’s seizures to occur again. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
