from two different proteins that are fused together. One of these proteins recognises and attaches to an 
antigen (a target protein) called  gp100 . Gp100 is found at high levels in uveal melanoma cancer 
cells. The other protein recognises and attaches to a protein called CD3. CD3 is found on certain cells 
of the body s immune system. By binding to gp100 and CD3, KIMMTRAK activates your immune 
system to recognise and destroy the cancer cells. </p>
<p>KIMMTRAK is used to treat adults with a rare eye cancer called  uveal melanoma . The medicine is 
used when the uveal melanoma has grown despite local treatment, or has spread to other parts of the 
body. </p>         </div>"""
