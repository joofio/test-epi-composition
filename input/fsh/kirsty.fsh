improved versions of human insulin.  </p>
<p>Kirsty is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and 
above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce 
enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with Kirsty helps to prevent 
complications from your diabetes.  </p>
<p>Kirsty will start to lower your blood sugar 10-20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect occurs 
between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3-5 hours. Due to this short action 
Kirsty should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin 
preparations. Moreover Kirsty can be used for continuous infusion in a pump system. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless.  </p>
<p>If any of these applies, do not use Kirsty. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. </p>
<p>Before using Kirsty </p>
<p>Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin.  </p>
<p>Remove the protective cap.  </p>
<p>Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination.  </p>
<p>Needles and syringes must not be shared. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: </p>
<p>If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.  </p>
<p>If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  </p>
<p>If you are ill, carry on using your insulin and consult your doctor.  </p>
<p>If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3, How to use Kirsty). Tell your doctor if 
you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical studies have been carried 
out in children below the age of 1 year. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kirsty 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you use:<br />
<em> Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes<br />
</em> Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)<br />
<em> Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure)<br />
</em> Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure)<br />
<em> Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)<br />
</em> Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)<br />
* Sulphonamides (used to treat infections).  </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you use:<br />
<em> Oral contraceptives (birth control pills)<br />
</em> Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention)<br />
<em> Glucocorticoids (such as  cortisone  used to treat inflammation)<br />
</em> Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders)<br />
<em> Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat 
asthma)<br />
</em> Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body s metabolic processes)<br />
* Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). </p>
<p>Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  </p>
<p>Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar.  </p>
<p>Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  </p>
<p>If you have used any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Kirsty and alcohol </p>
<p>If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise 
or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before using this medicine. Kirsty can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose 
may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, 
particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.  </p>
<p>There are no restrictions on treatment with Kirsty during breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine:<br />
<em> If you have frequent hypoglycaemia.<br />
</em> If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia.  </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and 
therefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger 
yourself or others.  </p>
<p>Kirsty has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier after 
an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. </p>
<p>Kirsty contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Dose and when to use your insulin<br />
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Kirsty is generally used immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of the 
injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, Kirsty can be given soon after a meal. See How 
and where to inject below for information.  </p>
<p>Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Kirsty can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human insulin 
when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in relation 
to meals.  </p>
<p>Use in special patient groups<br />
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor.  </p>
<p>How and where to inject<br />
Kirsty is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). or for continuous infusion in a pump system. 
Administration in a pump system will require a comprehensive instruction by your healthcare 
professional. You must never inject yourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle 
(intramuscularly). If necessary Kirsty can be given directly into a vein but this must only be done by 
physicians or other healthcare staff.  </p>
<p>With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4, Possible side effects). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front of 
your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if injected into the front of your waist. You should 
always measure your blood sugar regularly.  </p>
<p>How to use Kirsty 
1. Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. 
Inject the air into the vial.<br />
2. Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull 
the needle out of the vial. Then expel the air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct. </p>
<p>How to inject Kirsty </p>
<p>Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse.  </p>
<p>Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the 
insulin.  </p>
<p>Discard the needle after each injection. </p>
<p>For use in an infusion pump system<br />
Kirsty should never be mixed with any other insulin when used in a pump.<br />
Follow the instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding the use of Kirsty in a pump. 
Before use of Kirsty in the pump system, you must have received a comprehensive instruction in the 
use and information about any actions to be taken in case of illness, too high or too low blood sugar or 
failure of the pump system.<br />
<em> Before inserting the needle, use soap and water to clean your hands and the skin where the 
needle is inserted to avoid any infection at the infusion site.<br />
</em> When you fill a new reservoir, be certain not to leave large air bubbles in either the syringe or 
the tubing.<br />
* Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set.<br />
To get the benefit of insulin infusion, and to detect possible malfunction of the insulin pump, it is 
recommended that you measure your blood sugar level regularly. </p>
<p>What to do in case of pump system failure<br />
You should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under 
the skin in case of pump system failure. </p>
<p>If you use more insulin than you should 
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia). See a) Summary of
