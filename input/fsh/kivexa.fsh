Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4. Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. Do not take Kivexa 
Take special care with Kivexa 
Some people taking Kivexa or other combination treatments for HIV are more at risk of serious side 
effects. You need to be aware of the extra risks: 
* if you have moderate or severe liver disease 
* if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B 
infection, do not stop Kivexa without your doctor s advice, as your hepatitis may come back) 
* if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman) 
* if you have a kidney problem  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you before using Kivexa. You may need extra 
check-ups, including blood tests, while you are taking your medicine. See Section 4 for more 
information.  </p>
<p>Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions 
Even patients who don t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity 
reaction (a serious allergic reaction) </p>
<p>Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4 of this 
leaflet. </p>
<p>Risk of cardiovascular events 
It cannot be excluded that abacavir may increase the risk of having cardiovascular events. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have cardiovascular problems, if you smoke, or have other illnesses that 
may increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, or diabetes. Do 
not stop taking Kivexa unless your doctor advises you to do so. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. You 
need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Kivexa. </p>
<p>Read the information  Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV  in 
Section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kivexa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or if you have taken any 
recently, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.<br />
Remember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking 
Kivexa. </p>
<p>These medicines should not be used with Kivexa: 
* Emtricitabine, to treat HIV infection 
* other medicinal products containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection or hepatitis B 
infection 
* high doses of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic 
* cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia 
Tell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these. </p>
<p>Some medicines interact with Kivexa 
These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>phenytoin, for treating epilepsy.   </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin. Your doctor may need to monitor you while you 
are taking Kivexa. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>methadone, used as a heroin substitute. Abacavir increases the rate at which methadone is 
removed from the body. If you are taking methadone, you will be checked for any 
withdrawal symptoms. Your methadone dose may need to be changed.<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking methadone. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, 
mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. </p>
<ul>
<li>Riociguat, for treating high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) 
that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. Your doctor may need to reduce your riociguat 
dose, as abacavir may increase riociguat blood levels. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy 
Kivexa is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Kivexa and similar medicines may cause 
side effects in unborn babies.<br />
If you have taken Kivexa during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other 
diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs 
during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. A small amount of the ingredients in Kivexa can also pass into your 
breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Kivexa may cause side effects which could affect your ability to drive or use machines.<br />
Talk to your doctor about your ability to drive or operate machines while taking Kivexa.  </p>
<p>Important information about some of the other ingredients of Kivexa tablets 
Kivexa contains a colouring called sunset yellow (E110), this may cause allergic reactions in some 
people. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

is one tablet once a day.<br />
Swallow the tablets whole, with some water. Kivexa can be taken with or without food. 
Stay in regular contact with your doctor 
Kivexa helps to control your condition. You need to keep taking it every day to stop your illness 
getting worse. You may still develop other infections and illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
Keep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Kivexa without your doctor s advice. </p>

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before.<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  </p>
<p>It is important to take Kivexa regularly, because if you take it at irregular intervals, you may be more

<p>If you have stopped taking Kivexa 
If you have stopped taking Kivexa for any reason   especially because you think you are having side 
effects, or because you have other illness: 
Talk to your doctor before you start taking it again. Your doctor will check whether your 
symptoms were related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been 
related, you will be told never again to take Kivexa, or any other medicine containing 
abacavir (e.g.Trizivir, Triumeq or Ziagen). It is important that you follow this advice. </p>

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  </p>
<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. </p>
<p>When you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of Kivexa 
or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV disease itself. So it is very important to talk 
to your doctor about any changes in your health. </p>
<p>Even patients who don t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity 
reaction (a serious allergic reaction), described in this leaflet in the panel headed 
 Hypersensitivity reactions .  </p>
<p>It is very important that you read and understand the information about this serious 
reaction. </p>
<p>As well as the side effects listed below for Kivexa, other conditions can develop during combination 
therapy for HIV.<br />
It is important to read the information later in this section under  Other possible side effects of 
combination therapy for HIV . </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions 
Kivexa contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in medicines such as Trizivir, Triumeq 
and Ziagen). Abacavir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. These 
hypersensitivity reactions have been seen more frequently in people taking medicines that contain 
abacavir.  </p>
<p>Who gets these reactions? 
Anyone taking Kivexa could develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which could be life 
threatening if they continue to take Kivexa. 
You are more likely to develop this reaction if you have a gene called HLA-B*5701 (but you can get a 
reaction even if you do not have this gene). You should have been tested for this gene before Kivexa 
was prescribed for you. If you know you have this gene, tell your doctor before you take Kivexa. </p>
<p>About 3 to 4 in every 100 patients treated with abacavir in a clinical trial who did not have the HLA-
B*5701 gene developed a hypersensitivity reaction. </p>
<p>What are the symptoms? 
The most common symptoms are: 
* fever (high temperature) and skin rash. </p>
<p>Other common symptoms are: 
* nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (stomach) pain, severe  </p>
<p>tiredness. </p>
<p>Other symptoms include: </p>
<p>Pains in the joints or muscles, swelling of the neck, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough, occasional 
headaches, inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), mouth ulcers, low blood pressure, tingling or 
numbness of the hands or feet. </p>
<p>When do these reactions happen? </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions can start at any time during treatment with Kivexa, but are more likely 
during the first 6 weeks of treatment. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately: 
1 
if you get a skin rash, OR 
2 
if you get symptoms from at least 2 of the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fever  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shortness of breath, sore throat or cough </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>severe tiredness or achiness, or generally feeling ill. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may advise you to stop taking Kivexa. </p>
<p>If you have stopped taking Kivexa 
If you have stopped taking Kivexa because of a hypersensitivity reaction, you must NEVER AGAIN 
take Kivexa, or any other medicine containing abacavir (e.g. Trizivir, Triumeq or Ziagen). If you 
do, within hours, your blood pressure could fall dangerously low, which could result in death. 
If you have stopped taking Kivexa for any reason   especially because you think you are having side 
effects, or because you have other illness: 
Talk to your doctor before you start again. Your doctor will check whether your symptoms were 
related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been, you will then be told 
never again to take Kivexa, or any other medicine containing abacavir (e.g. Trizivir, Triumeq or 
Ziagen). It is important that you follow this advice. </p>
<p>Occasionally hypersensitivity reactions have developed in people who start taking abacavir containing 
products again, but who had only one symptom on the Alert Card before they stopped taking it. 
Very rarely patients who have taken medicines containing abacavir in the past without any symptoms 
of hypersensitivity have developed a hypersensitivity reaction when they start taking these medicines 
again. </p>
<p>If your doctor advises that you can start taking Kivexa again, you may be asked to take your first doses 
in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. </p>
<p>If you are hypersensitive to Kivexa, return all your unused Kivexa tablets for safe disposal. Ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice. 
The Kivexa pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity 
reactions. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. </p>

and genitals (Stevens Johnson syndrome), and a more severe form causing skin peeling in 
more than 30% of the body surface (toxic epidermal necrolysis). 
* lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms contact a doctor urgently. 
Very rare side effects that may show up in blood tests are:<br />
* a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia).  </p>
<p>If you get side effects 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects gets severe or troublesome, or if you 
notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV 
Combination therapy such as Kivexa may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation 
Old infections may flare up 
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been  silent  and not 
detected by the weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the 
immune system becomes stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of 
infection or inflammation. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: 
* headache 
* stomach ache 
* difficulty breathing 
In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue 
(autoimmune disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you 
start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
* palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
* hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)<br />
* weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body 
If you get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the symptoms above: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your 
doctor s advice. </p>
<p>You may have problems with your bones </p>
<p>Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
* if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
* if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
* if they drink alcohol 
* if their immune systems are very weak 
* if they are overweight. 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
* stiffness in the joints 
* aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
* difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not 
listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this 
medicine. </p>         </div>"""
