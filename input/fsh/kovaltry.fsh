<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have: 
* tightness in the chest, dizziness (including when you get up from sitting or lying down), itchy 
nettle-rash, wheezing, feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a rare severe sudden allergic 
reaction to Kovaltry. Stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice 
if this occurs. 
* bleeding that is not being controlled with your usual dose of Kovaltry. The formation of 
inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all 
Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly, patients receiving Kovaltry will be monitored carefully for the development of these 
inhibitors. If your or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with Kovaltry, tell your 
doctor immediately. 
* previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product. If you switch factor VIII 
products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back. 
* a confirmed heart disease or are at risk of heart disease.<br />
* to use a central venous access device for the administration of Kovaltry. You may be at risk of 
device related complications where the catheter is inserted including: 
- local infections 
- bacteria in the blood<br />
- a blood clot in the blood vessel. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The listed warnings and precautions apply to patients of all ages, adults and children. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kovaltry 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Kovaltry is not likely to affect the fertility in male or female patients, as the active substance is 
naturally occurring in the body. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you experience dizziness or any other symptoms affecting your ability to concentrate and react, do 
not drive or use machines until the reaction subsides. </p>
<p>Kovaltry contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Treatment with Kovaltry will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor 
if you are not sure. 
The number of factor VIII units is expressed in International Units (IU). </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding 
 To treat a bleed, your doctor will calculate and adjust your dose and how often it should be given, 
depending on factors such as: 
* your weight 
* the severity of your haemophilia A 
* where the bleed is and how serious it is 
* whether you have inhibitors and how high their level is 
* the factor VIII level that is needed. </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding 
If you are using Kovaltry to prevent bleeding, your doctor will calculate the dose for you. This will 
usually be in the range of 20 to 40 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, injected two or three 
times per week. However, in some cases, especially for younger patients, shorter dose intervals or 
higher doses may be necessary. </p>
<p>Laboratory tests 
Laboratory tests at suitable intervals help to ensure you always have adequate factor VIII levels. For 
major surgery in particular, your blood clotting must be closely monitored. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Kovaltry can be used in children of all ages. In children below the age of 12 higher doses or more 
frequent injections than prescribed for adults may be needed. </p>
<p>Patients with inhibitors 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you may need to 
use a larger dose of Kovaltry to control bleeding. If this dose does not control your bleeding your 
doctor may consider giving you another product. 
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this. 
Do not increase the dose of Kovaltry to control your bleeding without checking with  your doctor. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
Usually, Kovaltry treatment for haemophilia is needed life-long. </p>
<p>How Kovaltry is given 
Kovaltry is injected into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort 
level and should be used within 3 hours after reconstitution.  </p>
<p>How Kovaltry is prepared for administration 
Use only the components (vial adapter, pre filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) 
provided with each package of this medicine. Please contact your doctor if these components cannot 
be used. Do not use if any component of the package is opened or damaged. </p>
<p>The reconstituted product must be filtered by using the vial adapter before administration to remove 
any possible particles in the solution. </p>
<p>Do not use the venipuncture set provided for drawing blood because it contains an in-line filter. </p>
<p>This medicine must not be mixed with other infusion solutions. Do not use solutions containing 
visible particles or that are cloudy. Follow the instructions for use given by your doctor and provided 
at the end of this leaflet. </p>
<p>If you use more Kovaltry than you should 
Tell your doctor if this occurs. No cases of overdose have been reported.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Kovaltry 
Administer your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor.<br />
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  </p>
<p>If you stop using Kovaltry 
Do not stop using this medicine without checking with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
