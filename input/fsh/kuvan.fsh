  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Kuvan contains the active substance sapropterin which is a synthetic copy of a body s own substance called 
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is required by the body to use an amino acid called phenylalanine in order to 
build another amino acid called tyrosine. </p>
<p>Kuvan is used to treat hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) or phenylketonuria (PKU) in patients of all ages. HPA 
and PKU are due to abnormally high levels of phenylalanine in the blood which can be harmful. Kuvan 
reduces these levels in some patients who respond to BH4 and can help increase the amount of phenylalanine 
that can be included in the diet. </p>
<p>This medicine is also used to treat an inherited disease called BH4 deficiency in patients of all ages, in which 
the body cannot produce enough BH4. Because of very low BH4 levels phenylalanine is not used properly 
and its levels rise, resulting in harmful effects. By replacing the BH4 that the body cannot produce, Kuvan 
reduces the harmful excess of phenylalanine in the blood and increases the dietary tolerance to 
phenylalanine. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kuvan, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are 65 years of age or older </li>
<li>if you have problems with your kidney or liver </li>
<li>if you are ill. Consultation with a physician is recommended during illness as blood phenylalanine 
levels may increase </li>
<li>if you have predisposition to convulsions </li>
</ul>
<p>When you are treated with Kuvan, your doctor will test your blood to verify how much phenylalanine and 
tyrosine it contains and may decide to adjust the dose of Kuvan or your diet if needed. </p>
<p>You must continue your diet treatment as recommended by your doctor. Do not change your diet without 
contacting your doctor. Even if you take Kuvan, if your phenylalanine blood levels are not well controlled, 
you can develop severe neurologic problems. Your doctor should continue to monitor your blood 
phenylalanine levels often during your treatment with Kuvan, to make sure that your blood phenylalanine 
levels are not too high or too low. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kuvan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. In 
particular you should tell your doctor if you are using:</p>
<ul>
<li>levodopa (used to treat Parkinson s disease) </li>
<li>medicines for treatment of cancer (e.g. methotrexate) </li>
<li>medicines for treatment of bacterial infections (e.g. trimethoprim) </li>
<li>medicines that cause dilation of blood vessels, (such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide dinitrate 
(ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), molsidomin, minoxidil). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant your doctor will tell you how to control phenylalanine levels adequately. If these are not 
strictly controlled before or when you become pregnant, this could be harmful to you and to your baby. Your 
doctor will monitor the restriction of dietary phenylalanine intake prior and during pregnancy. </p>
<p>If the strict diet does not adequately reduce phenylalanine amount in your blood your doctor will consider 
whether you must take this medicine.  </p>
<p>You should not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Kuvan is not expected to affect the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Kuvan 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dosing for PKU 
The recommended starting dose of Kuvan in patients with PKU is 10 mg for each kg of body weight. Take 
Kuvan as a single daily dose with a meal to increase the absorption, and at the same time each day, 
preferably in the morning. Your doctor may adjust your dose, usually between 5 and 20 mg for each kg of 
body weight per day, depending on your condition. </p>
<p>Dosing for BH4 deficiency 
The recommended starting dose of Kuvan in patients with BH4 deficiency is 2 to 5 mg for each kg of body 
weight. Take Kuvan with a meal to increase the absorption. Divide the total daily dose into 2 or 3 doses, 
taken over the day. Your doctor may adjust your dose up to 20 mg for each kg of body weight per day, 
depending on your condition. </p>

<p>Method of administration 
For PKU patients, the total daily dose is taken once a day at the same time each day, preferably in the 
morning.  </p>
<p>For BH4 deficiency patients, the total daily dose is divided into 2 or 3 doses over the day. </p>
<p>Use in all patients<br />
Place the prescribed number of tablets in a glass or cup of water as accurately described below and stir until 
dissolved. </p>
<p>It may take a few minutes for the tablets to dissolve. To make the tablets dissolve faster you can crush them. 
Small particles may be visible in the solution, but they will not affect the effectiveness of the medicine. 
Drink the dissolved preparation of Kuvan with a meal within 15 to 20 minutes of its preparation.  </p>
<p>Do not swallow the desiccant capsule contained in the bottle. </p>
<p>Use in patients above 20 kg body weight 
Place the tablets in a glass or cup (120 to 240 ml) of water and stir until dissolved. </p>
<p>Use in children up to 20 kg body weight 
The dose is based on body weight. This will change as your child grows. Your doctor will tell you: 
* the number of Kuvan tablets needed for one dose 
* the amount of water needed to mix one dose of Kuvan 
* the amount of solution you will need to give your child for their prescribed dose </p>
<p>Your child should drink the solution with a meal.  </p>
<p>Give your child the prescribed amount of solution within 15 to 20 minutes after dissolving. If you are not 
able to give your child s dose within 15 to 20 minutes after dissolving the tablets, you will need to prepare a 
new solution as the unused solution should not be used beyond 20 minutes. </p>
<p>Supplies needed to prepare and give your child s dose of Kuvan 
* The number of Kuvan tablets needed for one dose 
* A medicine cup with graduation markings at 20, 40, 60 and 80 ml 
* A glass or cup 
* Small spoon or clean utensil for stirring 
* Oral syringe (graduated in 1 ml divisions) (10 ml syringe for administration of volumes of  10 ml or 
20 ml syringe for administration of volumes of &gt;10 ml) </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for the medicine cup for dissolving the tablets and the 10 ml or 20 ml oral syringe if you do 
not have these supplies. </p>
<p>Steps for preparing and taking your dose: 
* Place the prescribed number of tablets in the medicine cup. Pour the amount of water into the 
medicine cup, as instructed by your doctor (e.g. your doctor told you to use 20 ml for dissolving one 
Kuvan tablet). Check to make sure that the amount of liquid lines up with the amount that your doctor 
tells you. Stir with the small spoon or clean utensil until the tablets dissolve.<br />
<em> If your doctor told you to administer only a portion of the solution, point the tip of the oral syringe into 
the medicine cup. Slowly pull back the plunger to withdraw the amount as instructed by your doctor.<br />
</em> Transfer the solution by pushing on the plunger slowly until all of the solution in the oral syringe is 
transferred to a glass or cup for administration (e.g. if your doctor told you to dissolve two Kuvan 
tablets in 40 ml water and administer 30 ml to your child, you would have to use the 20 ml oral 
syringe two times to draw up 30 ml (e.g. 20 ml + 10 ml) of the solution and transfer it to a glass or cup 
for administration). Use a 10 ml oral syringe for administration of volumes  10 ml or a 20 ml oral 
syringe for administration of volumes &gt;10 ml. 
* If your baby is too small to drink from a glass or a cup you may administer the solution via the oral 
syringe. Draw up the prescribed volume from the solution prepared in the medicine cup and place the 
tip of the oral syringe into your baby s mouth. Point the tip of the oral syringe towards either cheek. 
Push on the plunger slowly, a small amount at a time, until all of the solution in the oral syringe is 
given.<br />
* Throw away any remaining solution. Remove the plunger from the barrel of the oral syringe. Wash 
both parts of the oral syringe and the medicine cup with warm water and air dry. When the oral 
syringe is dry, put the plunger back into the barrel. Store the oral syringe and the medicine cup for 
next use. </p>
<p>If you take more Kuvan than you should 
If you take more Kuvan than prescribed, you may experience side effects that could include headache and 
dizziness. Immediately contact your doctor or pharmacist if you take more Kuvan than prescribed. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Kuvan 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose at the usual time. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Kuvan 
Do not stop taking Kuvan without prior discussion with your doctor, as phenylalanine levels in your blood 
may increase.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
