  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Kyprolis is a medicine that contains the active substance carfilzomib. </p>
<p>Carfilzomib works by blocking the proteasome. The proteasome is a system within the cells that 
breaks down proteins when they are damaged or no longer needed. By preventing the breakdown of 
proteins in cancer cells, which are more likely to contain more abnormal proteins, Kyprolis causes the 
death of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Kyprolis is used to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma who have had at least one previous 
treatment for this disease. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells (a type of white blood cell). </p>
<p>Kyprolis will be given to you together with daratumumab and dexamethasone, with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, or only with dexamethasone. Daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone are 
other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma. </p>         </div>"""

during treatment. Before starting Kyprolis, and during treatment, you will undergo blood testing. This 
is to check that you have enough blood cells and your liver and kidneys are working properly. Your 
doctor or nurse will check if you are getting enough fluids. </p>
<p>You must read the package leaflet of all medicines that you take in combination with Kyprolis so that 
you understand the information related to those medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use Kyprolis if you are allergic to carfilzomib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Kyprolis if you have any of the conditions listed below. 
You may need extra tests to check that your heart, kidneys and liver are working properly. </p>
<ul>
<li>Heart problems, including a history of chest pain (angina), heart attack, irregular heartbeat, high 
blood pressure or if you have ever taken a medicine for your heart </li>

blood, dark tarry stools, or bright red blood in your stools; or bleeding in the brain leading to 
sudden numbness or paralysis on one side of the face, legs or arms, sudden severe headache or 
trouble seeing or difficulty speaking or swallowing. This can indicate you have low numbers of 
platelets (cells that help the blood to clot) </li>
<li>A history of blood clots in your veins </li>
<li>Leg or arm pain or swelling (which could be a symptom of blood clots in the deep veins of the

</ul>
<p>Conditions you need to look out for </p>
<p>You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Kyprolis to reduce the risk of any 
problems. Kyprolis can make some conditions worse or cause serious side effects, which may be fatal, 
such as heart problems, lung problems, kidney problems, tumour lysis syndrome (a life-threatening 
condition that occurs when cancer cells break and release their content to the bloodstream), reactions 
to the Kyprolis infusion, unusual bruising or bleeding, (including internal bleeding), blood clots in 
your veins, liver problems, certain blood conditions, or a neurological condition known as PRES. See

blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way 
you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of 
sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal 
brain condition known as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these 
symptoms prior to treatment with carfilzomib, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Kyprolis </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes any medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins or herbal remedies. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking medicines used to prevent pregnancy such as oral 
contraceptives or other hormonal contraceptives, as these may not be suitable for use with Kyprolis. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>For women taking Kyprolis </p>
<p>Do not take Kyprolis if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.

lenalidomide, you must follow the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (see package leaflet for 
lenalidomide for information on pregnancy prevention and discuss with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse). </p>
<p>For men taking Kyprolis </p>
<p>While taking Kyprolis and for 90 days after stopping treatment, you should use a condom even if your 
partner is pregnant. </p>

treatment, notify your doctor or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>While you are being treated with Kyprolis you may experience fatigue, dizziness, fainting, and/or a 
drop in blood pressure. This may impair your ability to drive or operate machines. Do not drive a car 
or operate machines if you have these symptoms. </p>
