Lacosamide Accord contains lacosamide. This belongs to a group of medicines called  antiepileptic 
medicines . These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. 
  You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have. </p>
<p>What Lacosamide Accord is used for 
  Lacosamide Accord  is used: * on its own and in association with other antiepileptic medicines in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 2 years and older to treat a certain type of epilepsy characterised by the 
occurrence of partial-onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation. In this type of 
epilepsy, fits first affect only one side of your brain. However, these may then spread to 
larger areas on both sides of your brain.  * in association with other antiepileptic medicines in adults, adolescents and children aged 4 
years and older to treat primary generalised tonic- clonic seizures (major fits, including loss 
of consciousness) in patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that 
is thought to have a genetic cause). </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to lacosamide, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you are not sure whether you are allergic, please discuss with your doctor. </p>
<p>if you are allergic to peanut or soya. </p>
<p>if you have a certain type of heart beat problem called second- or third-degree AV block. </p>
<p>Do not take Lacosamide Accord if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Lacosamide Accord if: </p>
<p>you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with 
antiepileptic medicinal products such as lacosamide have had thoughts of harming or killing 
themselves. If you have any of these thoughts at any time, tell your doctor straight away. 
  you have a heart problem that affects the beat of your heart and you often have a particulary 
slow, fast or irregular heart beat  (such as AV block, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter).<br />
   you have severe heart disease such as heart failure or have had a heart attack.<br />
   you are often dizzy or fall over. Lacosamide Accord may make you dizzy- this could increase 
the risk of accidental injury or a fall. This means that- you should take care until you are used 
to the effects of this medicine. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Lacosamide Accord. 
If you are taking Lacosamide Accord, talk to your doctor if you are experiencing a new type of seizure 
or worsening of existing seizures. 
If you are taking Lacosamide Accord and you are experiencing symptoms of abnormal heartbeat (such 
as slow, rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, fainting), 
seek medical advice immediately (see section 4). </p>
<p>Children<br />
Lacosamide Accord is not recommended for children aged under 2 years with epilepsy characterised 
by the occurrence of partial-onset seizure and not recommended for children aged under 4 years with 
primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. This is because we do not yet know whether it will work 
and whether it is safe for children in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lacosamide Accord<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that affect 
your heart - this is because Lacosamide Accord can also affect your heart: </p>
<p>medicines to treat heart problems;  </p>
<p>medicines which can increase the  PR interval  on a scan of the heart (ECG or 
electrocardiogram) such as medicines for epilepsy or pain called carbamazepine, lamotrigine 
or pregabalin;   </p>
<p>medicines used to treat certain types of irregular heart beat or heart failure.  </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Lacosamide Accord.  </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines - this is because 
they may increase or decrease the effect of Lacosamide Accord on your body: </p>
<p>medicines for fungal infections such as fluconazole, itraconazole or ketoconazole;  </p>
<p>medicines for HIV such as ritonavir;  </p>
<p>medicines used to treat bacterial infections such as clarithromycin or rifampicin;  </p>
<p>a herbal medicine used to treat mild anxiety and depression called St.John s wort. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Lacosamide Accord. </p>
<p>Lacosamide Accord with alcohol 
As a safety precaution do not take Lacosamide Accord with alcohol. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Fertile women should discuss the use of contraceptives with the doctor. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not recommended to take Lacosamide Accord if you are pregnant, as the effects of lacosamide on 
pregnancy and the unborn baby are not known.  It is not recommended to breast-feed your baby while 
taking Lacosamide Accord, as Lacosamide Accord passes into breast milk. Seek advice immediately 
from your doctor if you get pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. They will help you decide if 
you should take Lacosamide Accord or not. </p>
<p>Do not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first as this could increase your fits (seizures). A 
worsening of your disease can also harm your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until you know how this medicine affects you. This is 
because Lacosamide Accord may make you feel dizzy or cause blurred vision.  </p>
<p>Lacosamide Accord contains soya lecithin. 
If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicinal product.  </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. Other form(s) of this medicine may be more suitable for children; 
ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Taking Lacosamide Accord 
   Take Lacosamide Accord twice each day- approximately 12 hours apart. Try to take it at 
about the same time each day. 
   Swallow the Lacosamide Accord tablet with a glass of water. 
   You may take Lacosamide Accord with or without food.  </p>
<p>You will usually start by taking a low dose each day and your doctor will slowly increase this over a 
number of weeks. When you reach the dose that works for you, this is called the  maintenance dose , 
you then take the same amount each day. Lacosamide Accord is used as a long term treatment. You 
should continue to take Lacosamide Accord until your doctor tells you to stop. </p>
<p>How much to take 
Listed below are the normal recommended doses of Lacosamide Accord for different age groups and 
weights. Your doctor may prescribe a different dose if you have problems with your kidneys or with 
your liver. </p>
<p>Adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more and adults 
When you take Lacosamide Accord on its own 
The usual starting dose of Lacosamide Accord is 50 mg twice a day.<br />
Your doctor may also prescribe a starting dose of 100 mg of Lacosamide Accord twice a day.<br />
Your doctor may increase your twice daily dose every week by 50 mg. This will be until you reach a 
maintenance dose between 100 mg and 300 mg twice a day.   </p>
<p>When you take Lacosamide Accord with other antiepileptic medicines 
The usual starting dose of Lacosamide Accord is 50 mg twice a day.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may increase your twice daily dose every week by 50 mg. This will be until you reach a 
maintenance dose between 100 mg and 200 mg twice a day.  </p>
<p>If you weigh 50 kg or more, your doctor may decide to start Lacosamide Accord treatment with a 
single  loading  dose of 200 mg. You would then start your ongoing maintenance dose 12 hours later.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg 
- In the treatment of partial-onset seizure: Observe that Lacosamide Accord is not recommended for 
children under 2 years of age. 
- In the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures: Observe that Lacosamide Accord is not 
recommended for children under 4 years of age. </p>
<p>The dose depends on their body weight. They usually start treatment with the syrup and only change to 
tablets if they are able to take tablets and get the correct dose with the different tablet strengths. The 
doctor will prescribe the formulation that is best suited to them. </p>
<p>If you take more Lacosamide Accord than you should<br />
If you have taken more Lacosamide Accord than you should, contact your doctor immediately. Do not 
try to drive. 
You may experience:<br />
  dizziness;<br />
  feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting);<br />
  fits (seizures), heart beat problems such a slow, fast or irregular heart beat, coma or a fall in 
blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Lacosamide Accord 
   If you have missed a dose within the first 6 hours of the scheduled dose, take it as soon as you 
remember.<br />
   If you have missed a dose beyond the first 6 hours of the scheduled dose, do not take the 
missed tablet anymore. Instead take Lacosamide Accord at the next time that you would 
normally take it.<br />
   Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Lacosamide Accord 
  Do not stop taking Lacosamide Accord without talking to your doctor, as your epilepsy may 
come back again or become worse.<br />
  If your doctor decides to stop your treatment with Lacosamide Accord , they will tell you how 
to decrease the dose step by step. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
