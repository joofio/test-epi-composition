<p>Lamivudine Teva is used to treat long term (chronic) hepatitis B infection in adults. </p>
<p>Lamivudine Teva is an antiviral medicine that suppresses the hepatitis B virus and belongs to a group 
of medicines called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). </p>
<p>Hepatitis B is a virus which infects the liver causes long term (chronic) infection, and can lead to liver 
damage. Lamivudine Teva can be used in people whose liver is damaged but still functions normally 
(compensated liver disease) and in combination with other medicines in people whose liver is damaged 
and does not function normally (decompensated liver disease). </p>
<p>Treatment with Lamivudine Teva can reduce the amount of hepatitis B virus in your body. This should 
lead to a reduction in liver damage and an improvement in your liver function. Not everyone responds 
to treatment with Lamivudine Teva in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the effectiveness of 
your treatment with regular blood tests. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Some people taking Lamivudine Teva or other similar medicines are more at risk of serious side 
effects. You need to be aware of the extra risks: </p>
<p>if you have ever had other types of liver disease, such as hepatitis C. </p>
<p>if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman). 
  Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-ups, including 
blood tests, while you are taking your medication. See section 4 for more information about the 
risks.  </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Lamivudine Teva without your doctor s advice, as there is a risk of your hepatitis 
getting worse. When you stop taking Lamivudine Teva your doctor will monitor you for at least four 
months to check for any problems. This will mean taking blood samples to check for any raised liver 
enzyme levels, which may indicate liver damage. See section 3 for more information about how to take 
Lamivudine Teva. </p>
<p>Protect other people 
Hepatitis B infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of 
infected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). Lamivudine Teva will not stop you passing 
hepatitis B infection on to other people. To protect other people from becoming infected with hepatitis 
B: </p>
<p>Use a condom when you have oral or penetrative sex. </p>
<p>Do not risk blood transfer   for example, do not share needles. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lamivudine Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.  </p>
<p>Remember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking 
Lamivudine Teva. </p>
<p>These medicines should not be used with Lamivudine Teva: 
* medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, mannitol, 
lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly 
* other medicines containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection (sometimes called the AIDS 
virus) 
* emtricitabine (used to treat HIV or hepatitis B infection) 
* cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia 
  Tell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby: 
  Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Lamivudine Teva during your 
pregnancy. 
Do not stop treatment with Lamivudine Teva without your doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Lamivudine Teva can pass into breast-milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: 
  Talk to your doctor before you take Lamivudine Teva. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Lamivudine Teva may make you feel tired, which could affect your ability to drive or use machines.<br />
  Don t drive or use machines unless you are sure you re not affected. </p>
<p>Lamivudine Teva contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

Stay in regular contact with your doctor 
Lamivudine Teva helps to control your hepatitis B infection. You need to keep taking it every day to 
control your infection and stop your illness getting worse. 
  Keep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Lamivudine Teva without your 
doctor s advice. </p>
<p>How much to take 
The usual dose of Lamivudine Teva is one tablet (100 mg lamivudine) once a day.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose if you have problems with your kidneys. An oral solution of 
Lamivudine is available for people who need a lower than usual dose, or who can t take tablets. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. </p>
<p>If you are already taking another medicine that contains lamivudine for HIV infection, your doctor will 
continue to treat you with the higher dose, (usually 150 mg twice a day), because the dose of 
lamivudine in Lamivudine Teva (100 mg) is not enough to treat HIV infection. If you are planning to 
change your HIV treatment, discuss this change with your doctor first. </p>
<p>Swallow the tablet whole, with some water. Lamivudine Teva can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more Lamivudine Teva than you should 
If you accidentally take too much Lamivudine Teva, tell your doctor or pharmacist, or contact your 
nearest hospital emergency department for further advice. If possible, show them the Lamivudine Teva 
pack. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Lamivudine Teva 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Lamivudine Teva 
You must not stop taking Lamivudine Teva without consulting your doctor. There is a risk of your 
hepatitis getting worse (see section 2). When you stop taking Lamivudine Teva your doctor will 
monitor you for at least four months to check for any problems. This will mean taking blood samples 
to check for any raised liver enzyme levels, which may indicate liver damage. </p>         </div>"""
