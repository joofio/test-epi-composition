<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V.. </p>
<p>Some people taking Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. or other combination treatments for HIV are more 
at risk of serious side effects. You need to be aware of the extra risks: 
* if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B infection, 
do not stop Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. without your doctor s advice, as your hepatitis may 
come back) 
* if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman) 
* if you or your child has a kidney problem, your dose may be altered. 
Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-ups, including blood 
tests, while you are taking your medicine. See section 4 for more information. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. You 
need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Lamivudine 
Teva Pharma B.V.. </p>
<p>Read the information  Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV  in section 4 of 
this leaflet. </p>

have taken Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular

mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the 
risk of side effects. </p>

passed on to the baby in breast milk. 
A small amount of the ingredients in Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. can also pass into your breast

<p>Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV 
Combination therapy including Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. may cause other conditions to develop 
during HIV treatment. </p>
<p>Old infections may flare up 
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When these people start treatment, they may find 
that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. These symptoms are 
probably caused by the body s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these 
infections. </p>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection while you are taking Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V.: 
Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your doctor s 
advice. </p>
<p>You may have problems with your bones 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
* if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
* if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
* if they drink alcohol 
* if their immune systems are very weak 
* if they are overweight. 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
* stiffness in the joints 
* aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
* difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety
