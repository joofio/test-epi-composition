- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to chlormethine or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Ledaga. </p>
<ul>
<li>Contact with your eyes must be avoided. Do not apply the medicine near the eyes, to the inside 
of the nostrils, the inside of the ear or on the lips. </li>
<li>If Ledaga gets in your eyes, it can cause pain, burning, swelling, redness, sensitivity to light, and 
blurred vision. It may also cause blindness and severe permanent injury to your eyes. If Ledaga 
gets in your eyes, rinse your eyes right away for at least 15 minutes with large amounts of water, 
a solution known as  0.9% sodium chloride solution  or an eye-wash solution, and seek medical 
assistance (including an eye doctor) as soon as possible. </li>
<li>If this medicine gets in your mouth or nose, it can cause pain, redness, and ulcers that may be 
severe. Rinse the affected area right away for at least 15 minutes with large amounts of water, 
and seek medical assistance as soon as possible. </li>
<li>This medicine can cause skin reactions, such as inflammation of your skin (redness and 
swelling), itching, blisters, ulcers and skin infections (see section 4). The risk for inflammation 
of the skin is increased if you apply Ledaga to your face, genital area, anus or skin folds. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to chlormethine. Contact your doctor 
or seek immediate medical attention if you experience allergic reactions to Ledaga (see 
section 4). </li>
<li>Skin cancers (abnormal growth of the cells in the skin) have been reported after application of 
chlormethine to the skin, although it is not known whether chlormethine causes this. Your 
doctor will check your skin for skin cancers during and after your treatment with Ledaga. Tell 
your doctor if you get any new damaged areas or ulcers on your skin. </li>
<li>Direct skin contact with Ledaga should be avoided in individuals other than the patient, such as 
caregivers. Risks of direct skin contact include inflammation of the skin (dermatitis), injury to 
their eyes, mouth, or nose, and skin cancers. Caregivers who accidentally come into contact 
with Ledaga must wash the affected area right away for at least 15 minutes. Remove and wash 
any contaminated clothing. Get medical help right away if Ledaga gets into your eyes, mouth, or 
nose. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents

effectiveness have not been established for this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ledaga 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>There is limited experience of chlormethine in pregnant women. Therefore, the use of this medicine is 
not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age not using contraception. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Ledaga passes into breast milk, and there may be a risk that the breast-feeding 
baby is exposed to Ledaga via contact with the mother s skin. Therefore, it is not recommended to 
breast-feed while taking this medicine.You should talk to your doctor before breast-feeding to 
determine whether or not it is best to breast-feed or to use Ledaga. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>
<p>Ledaga contains propylene glycol and butylhydroxytoluene 
Propylene glycol may cause skin irritation. Butylhydroxytoluene may cause local skin reactions (e.g. 
contact dermatits), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Ledaga is intended only for use on the skin. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is application as a thin film once a day to the affected areas of the skin. The 
dose is the same for elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) as for younger adult patients (aged 
18 years and older). </p>
<p>Your doctor may stop your treatment if you develop severe inflammation of the skin (i.e., redness and 
swelling), blisters and ulcers. Your doctor may restart the treatment upon improvement of your 
symptoms. </p>
<p>Instructions for use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Ledaga exactly as your doctor or pharmacist tells you. </li>
<li>Caregivers must wear disposable nitrile gloves when applying this medicine to patients (this is a 
special type of glove; ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions). </li>
<li>Remove the cap from the tube just before use. Use the cap to pierce the seal. </li>
<li>Apply Ledaga immediately or within 30 minutes of removing it from the refrigerator. </li>
<li>Apply a thin layer of this medicine to completely dry skin at least 4 hours before or 30 minutes 
after showering or washing. </li>
<li>Apply Ledaga to affected areas of the skin. In case of Ledaga exposure to non-affected areas of 
the skin, wash the exposed area with soap and water. </li>
<li>Allow the area to dry for 5 to 10 minutes after applying your medicine and before covering with 
clothing. </li>
<li>For patients applying the gel, wash your hands with soap and water immediately after applying. </li>

<li>Do not cover the treated area with air- or water-tight bandages after you have applied this 
medicine. </li>
<li>Until Ledaga has dried on the skin, avoid contact with an open flame or a lit cigarette. Ledaga 
contains alcohol and is therefore considered flammable. </li>
<li>Do not apply moisturisers or any other skin products (including medicines applied to the skin) 
for 2 hours before or 2 hours after the daily application of Ledaga. </li>
<li>Keep away from children and contact with food by storing Ledaga in its box and inside the 
plastic bag. </li>
</ul>

doctor. </p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
