  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>LEMTRADA contains the active substance alemtuzumab, which is used to treat a form of multiple sclerosis 
(MS) in adults, called relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). LEMTRADA does not cure MS, but it 
can reduce the number of MS relapses. It can also help to slow down or reverse some of the signs and 
symptoms of MS. In clinical studies, patients treated with LEMTRADA had fewer relapses and were less 
likely to experience worsening of their disability compared to patients treated with a beta-interferon injected 
multiple times per week. 
LEMTRADA is used if your MS is highly active despite that you have been treated with at least one other 
medicine for MS or if your MS is rapidly evolving. </p>
<p>What is multiple sclerosis? 
MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). In MS your 
immune system mistakenly attacks the protective layer (myelin) around the nerve fibres, causing 
inflammation. When the inflammation causes symptoms this is often called an “attack” or a “relapse”. In 
RRMS patients experience relapses followed by periods of recovery. </p>
<p>The symptoms you experience are determined by which part of your central nervous system is affected. The 
damage done to your nerves during this inflammation may be reversible, but as your disease progresses the 
damage may accumulate and become permanent. </p>
<p>How LEMTRADA works 
LEMTRADA adjusts your immune system to limit its attacks on your nervous system.  </p>         </div>"""

− 
if you are allergic to alemtuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
− 
if you are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
− 
if you are suffering from a serious infection<br />
− 
if you have any of the following conditions: 
o other autoimmune disease besides multiple sclerosis 
o uncontrolled high blood pressure 
o history of tears in blood vessels supplying the brain 
o history of stroke 
o history of heart attack or chest pain 
o history of bleeding disorder </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before LEMTRADA is given. After having a course of treatment with LEMTRADA you 
may be at greater risk of developing other autoimmune conditions, or experiencing serious infections. It is 
important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. You will be given a Patient Alert Card 
and a Patient Guide with further information. It is important that you keep the Patient Alert Card with you 
during treatment and for 4 years after your last infusion with LEMTRADA, because side effects may occur 
many years after treatment. When you have medical treatment, even if it is not for your MS, show the Patient 
Alert Card to the doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor will perform blood tests before you start treatment with LEMTRADA. These tests are done to 
see whether you may take LEMTRADA. Your doctor will also want to make sure that you do not have 
certain medical conditions or disorders before you start your treatment with LEMTRADA. </p>
<ul>
<li>Autoimmune conditions 
Treatment with LEMTRADA may increase the risk for autoimmune conditions. These are conditions in 
which your immune system mistakenly attacks your body. Information about some specific conditions that 
have been seen in MS patients who have been treated with LEMTRADA is provided below. </li>
</ul>
<p>The autoimmune conditions can occur many years after treatment with LEMTRADA. Therefore, regular 
blood and urine tests are needed until 4 years after your last infusion. Testing is needed even if you are 
feeling well and your MS symptoms are under control. There are certain signs and symptoms that you should 
look out for yourself. In addition, these conditions may occur beyond 4 years, therefore, you must continue 
to look for signs and symptoms, even after you no longer need to do monthly blood and urine tests. Details 
about the signs and symptoms, testing, and actions you need to take are described in sections 2 and 4 – 
autoimmune conditions.   </p>
<p>More helpful information about these autoimmune conditions (and the testing for them) can be found in the 
LEMTRADA Patient Guide. </p>
<p>o 
Acquired haemophilia A 
Uncommonly, patients developed a bleeding disorder caused by antibodies that work against 
factor VIII (a protein needed for normal clotting of blood), called acquired hemophilia A. This 
condition must be diagnosed and treated immediately. Symptoms of acquired hemophilia A are 
described in section 4.<br />
o 
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) 
Commonly, patients have developed a bleeding disorder caused by a low level of blood 
platelets, called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This must be diagnosed and treated 
early, as otherwise the effects can be serious or even fatal. Signs and symptoms of ITP are 
described in section 4.  </p>
<p>o 
Kidney disease (such as anti-GBM disease) 
Rarely, patients have experienced autoimmune related problems with their kidneys, such as anti-
glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease). Signs and symptoms of kidney 
disease are described in section 4. If untreated it can cause kidney failure requiring dialysis or 
transplantation, and may lead to death.  </p>
<p>o 
Thyroid disorders<br />
Very commonly, patients have experienced an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland 
affecting its ability to make or control hormones that are important for your metabolism.<br />
LEMTRADA may cause different types of thyroid disorders, including: 
* Over-active thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) when the thyroid produces too much 
hormone 
* Under-active thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) when the thyroid does not produce 
enough hormone. </p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders are described in section 4.<br />
If you develop a thyroid disorder, in most cases you will need to be treated for the rest of your 
life with medicines to control your thyroid disorder, and in some cases your thyroid gland may 
have to be removed.  </p>
<p>It is very important that you are properly treated for a thyroid disorder, especially if you become 
pregnant after using LEMTRADA. Having an untreated thyroid disorder could harm your 
unborn baby, or harm your baby after birth. </p>
<p>o 
Liver inflammation 
Some patients have developed liver inflammation after receiving LEMTRADA. Liver 
inflammation can be diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly after 
LEMTRADA treatment. If you develop one or more of the following symptoms report this to 
your doctor: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, yellow skin or eyes, 
dark urine, or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. </p>
<p>o 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
A blood clotting disorder called Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP), can occur with 
LEMTRADA. Blood clots form in blood vessels and can happen in the entire body. Get medical 
help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: skin or mouth bruising that may 
appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, fever, confusion, 
speech changes, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), low amount of urine, dark colored urine. 
It is advised to seek medical attention urgently as TTP can be fatal (see section 4 ‘Possible side 
effects’). </p>
<p>o    Sarcoidosis 
There have been reports of an immune system disorder (sarcoidosis) in patients treated with 
LEMTRADA. Symptoms can include persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, 
lymph node swelling, weight loss, skin rashes, and blurred vision </p>
<p>o Autoimmune Encephalitis 
Autoimmune encephalitis (an immune mediated brain disorder), can occur after receiving 
LEMTRADA. This condition may include symptoms such as behavioural and/or psychiatric 
changes, short term memory loss or seizures. The symptoms may resemble an MS relapse. If you 
develop one or more of these symptoms contact your doctor. </p>
<p>o Other autoimmune conditions<br />
Uncommonly, patients have experienced autoimmune conditions involving red blood cells or 
white blood cells. These can be diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly 
after LEMTRADA treatment. If you develop one of these conditions your doctor will tell you, 
and take appropriate measures to treat it.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Infusion reactions 
Most patients treated with LEMTRADA will experience side-effects at the time of the infusion or within hours after the infusion. To try to reduce infusion reactions, your doctor will give you other medicine(s) (see 
section 4 – infusion reactions). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other serious reactions occurring shortly after LEMTRADA infusion 
Some patients have had serious or life-threatening reactions after LEMTRADA infusion, including bleeding 
in the lung, heart attack, stroke or tears in blood vessels supplying the brain. Reactions may occur following 
any of the doses during the treatment course. In the majority of cases reactions occurred within 1-3 days of 
the infusion. Your doctor will monitor vital signs, including blood pressure, before and during the infusion. 
Get help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: trouble breathing, coughing up blood, chest 
pain, facial drooping, sudden severe headache, weakness on one side of the body, difficulty with speech or 
neck pain. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
Treatment with LEMTRADA may increase the risk of excessive activation of white blood cells associated 
with inflammation (haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated 
early. If you experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, bruising, or skin rash, contact your 
doctor immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) 
AOSD is a rare condition that has the potential to cause multi-organ inflammation with several symptoms 
such as fever &gt;39°C or 102.2°F lasting more than 1 week, pain, stiffness with or without swelling in multiple 
joints and/or a skin rash. If you experience a combination of these symptoms, contact your healthcare 
provider immediately.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infections 
Patients treated with LEMTRADA are at a higher risk of getting a serious infection (see section 4 – 
infections). In general, the infections can be treated with standard medicines. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to reduce the chance of getting an infection, your doctor will check if other medicines you are taking 
might be affecting your immune system. Therefore, it is important to tell your doctor about all medicines 
you are taking. </p>
<p>Also, tell your doctor if you are suffering from a serious infection before the start of your LEMTRADA 
treatment as your doctor should delay the treatment until the infection is resolved. </p>
<p>Patients treated with LEMTRADA are at a higher risk of developing herpes infection (e.g. a cold sore). In 
general, once a patient has had a herpes infection, they have an increased risk of developing another one. It is 
also possible to develop a herpes infection for the first time. It is recommended that your doctor prescribes a 
medicine to reduce the chance of developing a herpes infection, which should be taken on the days that you 
receive LEMTRADA treatment, and for one month following the treatment.  </p>
<p>In addition, infections which can result in abnormalities of the cervix (the neck of the womb) are possible. 
Therefore, it is recommended that all female patients have an annual screening performed, such as a cervical 
smear. Your doctor will explain to you what tests you will need. </p>
<p>Infections with a virus called cytomegalovirus have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. 
Most cases occurred within two months of alemtuzumab dosing. Tell your doctor right away if you have 
symptoms of infection such as fever, or swollen glands.  </p>
<p>Patients treated with LEMTRADA have had infections due to a virus called Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),<br />
including cases with severe and sometimes fatal liver inflammation. Tell your doctor right away if you have 
symptoms of infection such as fever, swollen glands, or fatigue.  </p>
<p>Patients treated with LEMTRADA are also at a higher risk of developing listeria infection (a bacterial 
infection caused by ingestion of contaminated foods). Listeria infection can cause serious illness, including 
meningitis, but can be treated with appropriate medicines. To reduce this risk, you should avoid eating 
uncooked or undercooked meats, soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products two weeks before treatment, 
during the treatment and for at least one month after LEMTRADA treatment. </p>
<p>If you live in a region where tuberculosis infections are common, you may be at greater risk of infection 
with tuberculosis. Screening for tuberculosis will be arranged by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are a carrier of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (these affect the liver), extra caution is needed 
before you receive LEMTRADA treatment as it is unknown if treatment could lead to activation of the 
hepatitis infection which could subsequently damage your liver.  </p>
<p>There have been cases of a rare brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy)in 
patients who have been given Lemtrada. PML has been reported in patients with other risk factors, 
specifically prior treatment with MS products associated with PML. 
PML may lead to severe disability over weeks or months and may be fatal.<br />
Symptoms may be similar to a relapse of MS and include progressive weakness  or clumsiness of limbs, 
disturbance of vision, speech difficulties or  changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to 
confusion and personality changes. It is important to inform your relatives or caregivers about your 
treatment, since they may notice symptoms that you are not aware of. Contact your doctor immediately if 
you develop any symptoms suggestive of PML. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pneumonitis and pericarditis 
Pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue) has been reported in LEMTRADA treated patients. Most cases 
occurred within the first month after treatment with LEMTRADA. Cases of pericardial effusion (collection 
of fluid around the heart) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart) have also been 
reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. You should report to your doctor symptoms like shortness of 
breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness and coughing up blood, as these could be caused by 
pneumonitis, pericardial effusion or pericarditis.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the gallbladder<br />
LEMTRADA may increase your chance of getting inflammation of the gallbladder. This may be a serious 
medical condition that can be life threatening. You should report to your doctor if you have symptoms such 
as stomach pain or discomfort, fever, nausea or vomiting.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously diagnosed cancer 
If you have been diagnosed with cancer in the past, please inform your doctor about it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines 
It is not known if LEMTRADA affects your response to a vaccine. If you have not completed the standard 
required vaccinations, your doctor will consider whether you should have them before your LEMTRADA 
treatment. In particular, your doctor will consider vaccinating you against chickenpox if you have never had 
it. Any vaccination will need to be given to you at least 6 weeks before starting a LEMTRADA treatment 
course.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must NOT receive certain types of vaccines (live viral vaccines) if you have recently received 
LEMTRADA.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
LEMTRADA is not intended to be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old as it has not been 
studied in MS patients below 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and LEMTRADA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines 
(including any vaccinations or herbal medecines). </p>
<p>Besides LEMTRADA, there are other treatments (including those for MS, or to treat other conditions) which 
could affect your immune system and so could affect your ability to fight infections. If you are using such a 
medicine, your doctor may ask you to stop this medicine before starting treatment with LEMTRADA.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice 
before being given this medicine. </p>
<p>Women who are able to conceive have to use effective contraception during each treatment course with 
LEMTRADA and for 4 months after each course of treatment. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant after treatment with LEMTRADA and experience a thyroid disorder during 
pregnancy, extra caution is needed. Thyroid disorders could be harmful to the baby (see section 2 Warnings 
and precautions – autoimmune conditions). </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is unknown if LEMTRADA can be transferred to a baby through breast milk, but there is a possibility that 
it could be. It is recommended that you do not breast-feed during each course of treatment with 
LEMTRADA and for 4 months after each treatment course. However, there may be benefits of breast milk 
(which can help protect a baby from infections), so talk to your doctor if you are planning to breast-feed your 
baby. He/She will advise you what is right for you and your baby. </p>
<p>Fertility 
During your treatment course and for 4 months afterwards, you may have LEMTRADA in your body. It is 
not known if LEMTRADA will have an effect on fertility during this period. Talk to your doctor if you are 
thinking about trying to become pregnant. There is no evidence that LEMTRADA has an impact on male 
fertility.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Many patients experience side effects at the time of the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion with 
LEMTRADA, and some of these, for example dizziness, could make it unsafe to drive or use machines. If 
affected, stop these activities until you feel better. </p>
<p>LEMTRADA contains potassium and sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘potassium- free’. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium- free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The initial treatment you will receive will consist of one infusion per day for 5 days (course 1) and one 
infusion per day for 3 days one year later (course 2). 
There is no LEMTRADA treatment between the two courses. Two treatment courses may reduce MS activity 
for up to 6 years. </p>
<p>Some patients, if they have symptoms or signs of MS disease after the initial two courses, may receive one or 
two additional treatment courses consisting of one infusion per day for 3 days . These additional treatment 
courses may be administered  twelve months or more after the prior treatments. </p>
<p>The maximum daily dose is one infusion. </p>
<p>LEMTRADA will be given to you as an infusion into a vein. Each infusion will take approximately 4 hours. 
Monitoring for side effects and regular testing must continue for 4 years after the last infusion. </p>
<p>To help you better understand the duration of the effects of treatment and the length of required follow-up, 
please refer to the diagram below. </p>
<p>Follow-up after treatment with LEMTRADA<br />
Once you have received LEMTRADA, you will need to undergo regular tests to ensure that any potential 
side effects can be diagnosed and treated promptly. These tests must continue until 4 years after your last 
infusion and are described in section 4 most important side-effects.  </p>
<p>If you are given more LEMTRADA than you should receive 
Patients who were accidentally given too much LEMTRADA in one infusion have experienced serious 
reactions, such as headache, rash, low blood pressure or increased heart rate. Doses higher than the 
recommended dose may result in more serious or longer lasting infusion reactions (see section 4) or a 
stronger effect on the immune system. The treatment consists of stopping LEMTRADA administration and 
treating the symptoms. </p>
<p>Missed LEMTRADA doses 
It is unlikely that your dose would be missed since it is administered by a health care professional. 
Nevertheless, please note that in case of missed dose, this should not be given on the same day as a scheduled 
dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The most important side effects are the autoimmune conditions described in section 2 which include: 
* Acquired haemophilia A (a type of bleeding disorder), (uncommon - may affect up to 1 in people): may show as spontaneous bruising, nose bleeds, painful or swollen joints, other types of 
bleeding, or bleeding from a cut that may take longer than usual to stop. 
* ITP (bleeding disorders), (common – may affect up to 1 in 10 people): may show as small scattered 
red, pink or purple spots on your skin; easy bruising; bleeding from a cut that is harder to stop; heavier, 
longer or more frequent menstrual periods than normal; bleeding between menstrual periods; bleeding 
from your gums or nose that is new or takes longer than usual to stop; or coughing up blood. 
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), (rare-may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): may show 
as skin or mouth bruising, that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme 
tiredness, fever, confusion, speech changes, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), low amount of 
urine, dark colored urine.<br />
* kidney disorders, (rare – may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): may show as blood in the urine (your 
urine may be red or tea-coloured), or as swelling in your legs or feet. It can also lead to damage of your 
lungs, which can result in coughing up blood. </p>
<p>If you notice any of these signs or symptoms for bleeding or kidney disorders, call your doctor 
immediately to report the symptoms. If you cannot reach your doctor, you must seek immediate 
medical attention. </p>
<ul>
<li>thyroid disorders (very common – may affect more than 1 in 10 people): may show as excessive 
sweating; unexplained weight-loss or gain; eye swelling; nervousness; fast heartbeat; feeling cold; 
worsening tiredness; or newly occurring constipation. </li>
<li>red and white blood cells disorders (uncommon – may affect up to 1 in 100 people): diagnosed from 
your blood tests. </li>
<li>sarcoidosis (uncommon – may affect up to 1 in 100 people): symptoms can include persistent dry 
cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, lymph node swelling, weight loss, skin rashes, and 
blurred vision. </li>
<li>autoimmune encephalitis (uncommon – may affect up to 1 in 100 people): may include symptoms 
such as behavioural and/or psychiatric changes, short term memory loss or seizures. The symptoms 
may resemble an MS relapse. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these serious side effects can start many years after you have received LEMTRADA. If you notice 
any of these signs or symptoms, call your doctor right away to report them. You will also have regular 
blood and urine tests to ensure that if you develop any of these conditions, they are treated promptly.  </p>
<p>Summary of tests you will have for autoimmune conditions: </p>
<p>Test 
When? 
For how long? 
Blood test<br />
(to diagnose all 
important serious side 
effects listed above) 
Before treatment starts and every 
month after treatment<br />
Until 4 years after your last 
LEMTRADA infusion<br />
Urine test<br />
(additional test to 
diagnose kidney 
disorders) 
Before treatment starts and every 
month after treatment 
Until 4 years after your last 
LEMTRADA infusion </p>
<p>After this time, if you have symptoms of ITP, acquired haemophilia A, TTP, kidney or thyroid disorders, 
your doctor will perform more tests. You should also continue looking for signs and symptoms of side effects 
beyond four years as detailed in your patient guide, and you should continue carrying the Patient Alert Card 
with you. </p>
<p>Another side effect is an increased risk of infections (see below for information on how often patients 
experience infections). In most cases, these are mild but serious infections can occur.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these signs of infection<br />
* fever and/or chills 
* swollen glands </p>
<p>To help reduce the risk of some infections your doctor may consider giving you vaccination against 
chickenpox and/or other vaccinations that they think are necessary for you (see section 2: What you need to 
know before you are administered LEMTRADA - Vaccines). Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine for 
cold sores (see section 2: What you need to know before you are administered LEMTRADA – Infections). </p>
<p>The most frequent side effects are infusion reactions (see below for information on how often patients 
experience these), which can happen at the time of the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion. In most 
cases these are mild but some serious reactions are possible. Occasionally allergic reactions could occur.  </p>
<p>To try to reduce infusion reactions, your doctor will give you medicine (corticosteroids) before each of the 
first 3 infusions of a LEMTRADA course. Other treatments to limit these reactions can also be given before 
the infusion or when you experience symptoms. In addition, you will be monitored during the infusion and 
for 2 hours after the infusion has been completed. In case of serious reactions, the infusion may be slowed 
down or even stopped. </p>
<p>Please refer to the LEMTRADA Patient Guide for more information about these events.  </p>
<p>These are the side effects that you may experience: </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
* Infusion reactions that can happen at the time of the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion: 
changes in heart rate, headache, rash, rash over your body, fever, hives, chills, itching, reddening of 
the face and neck, feeling tired, nausea 
* Infections: airway infections such as colds and sinus infections, urinary tract infections, herpes 
infections 
* Decrease in white blood cell numbers (lymphocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils) 
* Thyroid disorders such as over-active or under-active thyroid gland </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* Infusion reactions that can happen at the time of the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion:
