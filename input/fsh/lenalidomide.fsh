What Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto is used for
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto is used in adults for:
-
Multiple myeloma
-
Follicular lymphoma
Multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain kind of white blood cell, called the 
plasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide, becoming out of control. This can 
damage the bones and kidneys.
Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms can be greatly 
reduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a  response .
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma   in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto is used on its own as a maintenance therapy after patients have 
recovered enough following a bone marrow transplant.
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma   in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto is taken with other medicines. These may include:
-
a chemotherapy medicine called  bortezomib 
-
an anti-inflammatory medicine called  dexamethasone 
-
a chemotherapy medicine called  melphalan  and
-
an immunosuppressant medicine called  prednisone .
You will take these other medicines at the start of treatment and then continue to take Lenalidomide 
Krka d.d. Novo mesto on its own.
If you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check 
you carefully before starting treatment.
Multiple myeloma   in patients who have had treatment before

 dexamethasone .
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto can stop the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma getting 
worse. It has also been shown to delay multiple myeloma from coming back following treatment.
Follicular lymphoma (FL)
FL is a slow growing cancer that affects the B-lymphocytes. These are a type of white blood cells that 
help your body fight infection. When you have FL, too many of these B-lymphocytes may collect in 
your blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen.
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto is taken together with another medicine called  rituximab  for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma.
How Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto works

attacking the cancer. It works in a number of different ways:
