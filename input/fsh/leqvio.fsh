  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Leqvio is and how it works 
Leqvio contains the active substance inclisiran. Inclisiran lowers levels of LDL-cholesterol ( bad<br />
cholesterol), which can cause heart and blood circulation problems when levels are raised. </p>
<p>Inclisiran works by interfering with RNA (genetic material in body cells) to limit the production of a 
protein called PCSK9. This protein can increase LDL-cholesterol levels and preventing its production 
helps to lower your LDL-cholesterol levels. </p>
<p>What Leqvio is used for 
Leqvio is used in addition to your cholesterol-lowering diet if you are an adult with a high cholesterol 
level in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia, including heterozygous familial and non-familial, 
or mixed dyslipidaemia). </p>
<p>Leqvio is given:</p>
<ul>
<li>together with a statin (a type of medicine that treats high cholesterol), sometimes combined with 
another cholesterol-lowering treatment if the maximum dose of the statin does not work well 
enough, or </li>
<li>alone or together with other cholesterol-lowering medicines when statins do not work well or 
cannot be used. </li>
