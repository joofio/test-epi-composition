<p>Levetiracetam Hospira is used: 
* on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to 
treat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits 
(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only one 
side of the brain but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (partial 
onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given to you by 
your doctor to reduce the number of fits.<br />
* as an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines to treat: 
* partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents and children 
from 4 years of age. 
* myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in adults 
and adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. 
* primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in 
adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the 
type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause). </p>
<p>Levetiracetam Hospira concentrate for solution for infusion is an alternative for patients when 
administration of the antiepileptic levetiracetam medicine by mouth is temporarily not feasible. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Levetiracetam Hospira 
* If you suffer from kidney problems, follow your doctor s instructions. He/she may decide if 
your dose should be adjusted. 
* If you notice any slowdown in the growth or unexpected puberty development of your child, 
please contact your doctor. 
* A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Levetiracetam Hospira have 
had thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or 
suicidal ideation, please contact your doctor. 
* If you have a family or medical history of irregular heart rhythm (visible on an 
electrocardiogram), or if you have a disease and/or take a treatment that make(s) you prone to 
heartbeat irregularities or salt imbalances. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the following side effects gets serious or last longer than a few 
days: 
* Abnormal thoughts, feeling irritable or reacting more aggressively than usually, or if you or 
your family and friends notice important changes in mood or behaviour. 
* Aggravation of epilepsy: 
Your seizures may rarely become worse or happen more often, mainly during the first month 
after the start of the treatment or increase of the dose.<br />
In a very rare form of early-onset epilepsy (epilepsy associated with SCN8A mutations) that 
causes multiple types of seizures and loss of skills you may notice that the seizures remain 
present or are becoming worse during your treatment.  </p>
<p>If you experience any of these new symptoms while taking Levetiracetam Hospira, see a doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
* Levetiracetam Hospira is not indicated in children and adolescents below 16 years on its own 
(monotherapy). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Levetiracetam Hospira 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Do not take macrogol (a drug used as laxative) for one hour before and one hour after taking 
levetiracetam as this may results in a reduction of its effect.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only 
if after careful assessment it is considered necessary by your doctor. You should not stop your 
treatment without discussing this with your doctor. A risk of birth defects for your unborn child cannot 
be completely excluded. Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Levetiracetam Hospira may impair your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery, as it may 
make you feel sleepy. This is more likely at the beginning of treatment or after an increase in the dose. 
You should not drive or use machines until it is established that your ability to perform such activities 
is not affected. </p>
<p>Levetiracetam Hospira contains sodium 
One maximum single dose of Levetiracetam Hospira concentrate contains 57 mg of sodium (19 mg of 
sodium per vial) equivalent to 2.85% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for 
an adult. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""
