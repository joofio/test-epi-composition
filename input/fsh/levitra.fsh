They are used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men, a condition which implies 
difficulties in getting or keeping an erection. </p>
<p>At least one in ten men has trouble getting or keeping an erection at some time. There may be physical or 
psychological causes, or a mixture of both. Whatever the cause is, due to muscle and blood vessel 
changes not enough blood stays in the penis to make it hard and keep it hard. </p>
<p>Levitra will only work when you are sexually stimulated. It reduces the action of the natural chemical in 
your body which makes erections go away. Levitra allows an erection to last long enough for you to 
satisfactorily complete sexual activity. </p>         </div>"""
