</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given LIBTAYO if:<br />
* you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells) 
* you have had an organ transplant, or you have received or plan to receive a bone marrow 
transplant using bone marrow from another person (allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell

* you have any other medical conditions. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
LIBTAYO. </p>
<p>Look out for side effects 
LIBTAYO can cause some serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor about immediately. 
These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. You 
may have more than one side effect at the same time. </p>
<p>These serious side effects include: 
* Skin problems<br />
<em> Lung problems (pneumonitis)<br />
</em> Gut problems (colitis)<br />
<em> Liver problems (hepatitis)<br />
</em> Hormone gland problems - especially thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands and the pancreas 
* Type 1 diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from 
diabetes) 
* Kidney problems (nephritis and kidney failure) 
* Central nervous system problems (such as meningitis) 
* Infusion-related reactions<br />
* Muscle problems (inflammation of the muscles called myositis) 
* Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) 
* A disease where the immune system makes too many of otherwise normal infection-
fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes that may cause various symptoms 
(haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) (see  Possible side effects  for the list of signs and 
symptoms) 
* Problems in other parts of the body (see  Possible side effects ) </p>
<p>Look out for these side effects while you are receiving LIBTAYO. See  Possible side effects  section 
in section 4. If you have any of these effects, talk to your doctor immediately.<br />
Your doctor may give you other medicines in order to stop more severe reactions and reduce your 
symptoms. Your doctor also may delay your next dose of LIBTAYO or stop your treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
LIBTAYO should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and LIBTAYO 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking or have ever taken any of the following medicines: 
* a cancer medicine called idelalisib 
* medicines that make your immune system weak - examples include corticosteroids, such 
as prednisone. These medicines may interfere with the effect of LIBTAYO. However, 
once you are treated with LIBTAYO, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce 
the side effects that you may have with LIBTAYO.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before you are given this medicine. 
* LIBTAYO can harm your unborn baby. 
* Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are being treated with 
LIBTAYO. 
* If you are able to become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception to 
avoid becoming pregnant: </p>
<p>while you are being treated with LIBTAYO and </p>
<p>for at least 4 months after the last dose. 
* Talk to your doctor about the contraception methods that you must use during this time. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
* If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before you are 
given this medicine.<br />
<em> Do not breast-feed while you are being treated with LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months 
after the last dose.<br />
</em> It is not known if LIBTAYO passes into your breast milk.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines

not drive or use machines until you feel better.  </p>         </div>"""
