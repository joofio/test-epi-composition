<p>You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your 
blood. Liprolog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It 
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally 
use Liprolog within 15 minutes of a meal. </p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to use Liprolog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin 
comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless 
your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. </p>

- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to 
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Liprolog than you need). 
- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
  If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the 
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this 
leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how 
much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood 
glucose often. 
  A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have 
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse 
- Have you recently become ill? 
- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? 
-<br />
Are you exercising more than usual? 
  The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. 
  You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. 
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals 
at different times from when you are at home. 
  Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform 
your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of 
breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site: 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Liprolog). Contact your 
doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closey, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Liprolog 
Your insulin needs may change if you are taking<br />
  the contraceptive pill,<br />
  steroids,<br />
  thyroid hormone replacement therapy,<br />
  oral hypoglycaemics,<br />
  acetyl salicylic acid,<br />
  sulpha antibiotics,<br />
  octreotide,<br />
   beta2 stimulants  (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),<br />
  beta-blockers, or<br />
  some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),<br />
  danazol,<br />
  some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and<br />
  angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of 
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the 
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you 
have: 
* frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
* reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia </p>
<p>Liprolog contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always check the pack and the vial label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it 
from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Liprolog that your doctor has told you to use. </p>
<p>Always use Liprolog exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Dosage 
* You should normally inject Liprolog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject 
soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, 
and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes 
clinic regularly. 
* If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a 
Liprolog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the first 
injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.<br />
* Inject Liprolog under the skin. You should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told 
you to. </p>
<p>Preparing Liprolog 
* Liprolog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if 
it looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time 
you inject yourself. </p>
<p>Injecting Liprolog 
* First wash your hands. 
* Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber 
stopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. 
* Use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of 
Liprolog you want. Your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this. Do not share your 
needles and syringes. 
* Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, 
leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do 
not rub the area you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from 
the last injection and that you  rotate  the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn t 
matter which injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Liprolog 
injection will still work quicker than soluble human insulin. 
* Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Liprolog with one of the human insulins. For 
example if you do need to inject a mixture, draw the Liprolog into the syringe before the long 
acting insulin. Inject the liquid as soon as you have mixed it. Do the same thing every time. You 
should not normally mix Liprolog with one of the mixtures of human insulins. You should 
never mix Liprolog with insulins produced by other manufacturers or animal insulins. 
* You must not administer Liprolog by the intravenous route. Inject Liprolog as your physician or 
nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Liprolog by the intravenous route. He 
will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your glucose 
levels are too high. </p>
<p>Using Liprolog in an infusion pump 
* Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before 
infusing insulin lispro, the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the 
suitability or otherwise for the particular pump. Read and follow the instructions in the product 
literature supplied with the infusion pump. 
* Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. 
* Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set. </p>
<ul>
<li>In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped until the episode is 
resolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur, notify your doctor or clinic and 
consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion. </li>
<li>A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels. 
If an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in the product literature 
and if appropriate, notify your doctor or clinic. </li>
<li>When used with an insulin infusion pump, Liprolog should not be mixed with any other insulin. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you take more Liprolog than you need 
If you take more Liprolog than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.<br />
If your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. 
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will 
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your 
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat 
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to 
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Liprolog 
If you take less Liprolog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar </p>
<p>If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be 
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even 
death (see A and B in section 4  Possible Side Effects ). </p>
<p>Three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
* Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Liprolog. 
* Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
* Always carry sugar with you. </p>
<p>If you stop using Liprolog. 
If you take less Liprolog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin 
unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Systemic allergy is rare (  1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: 
* rash over the whole body * blood pressure dropping 
* difficulty in breathing 
* heart beating fast 
* wheezing </p>
<ul>
<li>sweating. 
If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Liprolog, tell your doctor at once. </li>
</ul>
<p>Local allergy is common (  1/100 to &lt;1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the 
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this 
happens to you, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Lipodystrophy is uncommon (  1/1,000 to &lt;1/100). If you inject insulin too often at the same place, 
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin 
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may 
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help 
prevent these skin changes. </p>
<p>Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of 
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Common problems of diabetes </p>
<p>A.<br />
Hypoglycaemia<br />
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
* you take too much Liprolog or other insulin; 
* you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
* you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
* you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
* there is a change in your need for insulin; or 
* you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. </p>
<p>Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. </p>
<p>The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
* tiredness </p>
<ul>
<li>rapid heartbeat </li>
<li>nervousness or shakiness * feeling sick </li>
<li>
<p>headache </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cold sweat. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. </p>
<p>B.<br />
Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. 
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
* not taking your Liprolog or other insulin; 
* taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; 
* eating a lot more than your diet allows; or 
* fever, infection or emotional stress. </p>
<p>Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. The symptoms include the following: 
* feeling sleepy 
* no appetite 
* flushed face<br />
* fruity smell on the breath 
* thirst  </p>
<ul>
<li>feeling or being sick. </li>
</ul>
<p>Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. </p>
<p>C.<br />
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
 sick rules , and tell your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

water for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been used to adjust the 
acidity.  </p>
<p>What Liprolog looks like and contents of the pack 
Liprolog 100 units/ml, solution for injection is a sterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution and 
contains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) solution for injection. Each vial 
contains 1000 units (10 millilitres). Liprolog 100 units/ml, solution for injection in vial comes in a 
pack of 1 vial, 2 vials or a multipack of 5 x 1 vial. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. </p>
