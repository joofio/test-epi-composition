these symptoms. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have or have had:</p>

<p>Before and during treatment with LITAK, you will have regular blood tests to check whether it is safe 
for you to continue with your treatment. Your doctor may decide that you should receive blood 
transfusions to improve your level of blood cells. In addition, the proper function of your liver and 
your kidneys will be checked.  </p>
<p>If you want to father a child, please tell your doctor before treatment with LITAK is started. You 
should not father a child during treatment and up to 6 months after treatment with LITAK. Your 
doctor may advise you about the possibility to store deep-frozen sperm (cryoconservation). </p>

medicines obtained without a prescription. In particular, tell your doctor if you are using any 
medicines containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>corticosteroids, commonly used to treat inflammation </li>

drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR INJECTION </p>
<p>This section contains information on how to give an injection of LITAK. It is important that you do 
not try to give yourself the injection unless you have been instructed by your doctor or nurse. Your 
doctor will tell you how much LITAK you need and how often and when you have to inject yourself. 
LITAK should be injected into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). If you have any 
question with regard to giving the injection, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. </p>
<p>LITAK is a cytotoxic and should therefore be handled with caution. When LITAK is not 
self-administered by the patient, the use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended 
when handling and administering LITAK. If LITAK contacts the skin or eyes, rinse the involved 
surface immediately with copious amounts of water. Pregnant women must avoid contact with 
LITAK. </p>
<p>What do I need for the injection? </p>
<p>To give yourself a subcutaneous injection, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one vial of LITAK (or two vials if you need to inject more than 5 ml). 
Do not use vials which are damaged, or if the solution is not clear or if it contains any particles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one sterile syringe (e.g. 10 ml LUER syringe), </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one sterile injection needle (e.g. 0.5 x 19 mm, 25 G x  ), </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alcohol wipes, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a puncture-proof container for safe disposal of the used syringe. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of LITAK? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before injection, allow LITAK to warm up to room temperature. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach it. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I prepare the injection? </p>
<p>Before you inject LITAK, you must do the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the red protective cap from the LITAK vial. Do not remove the rubber stopper of the 
vial. Clean the rubber top of the vial with an alcohol wipe. Remove the syringe from the 
wrapping without touching the tip of the syringe. Remove the injection needle from the 
wrapping and place it firmly on the tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard without 
touching the needle. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial and turn the vial and the syringe upside 
down. Be sure that the tip of the needle is in the solution. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw the correct volume of LITAK into the syringe by pulling back the plunger (your doctor 
will inform you how many ml of LITAK you need to inject). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull the needle out of the vial. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure there is no air left in the syringe: point the needle upwards and push the air out. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check you have the right volume. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inject straight away. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where should I give my injection? </p>
<p>The most suitable places to inject yourself are 
shown here: the top of your thighs and the 
abdomen, except for the area around the navel. 
If someone else is injecting you, they can also 
use the outer surface of the upper arms or the 
buttocks. </p>
<p>How do I give my injection? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pull slightly on the plunger to check that no blood vessel has been punctured. If you see blood 
in the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inject the liquid slowly and evenly for approximately one minute, always keeping the skin 
pinched. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After injecting the liquid, remove the needle. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the used syringe in the puncture-proof container. Use a new syringe and injection needle for 
each injection. The vials are for single use only. Return any portion of the contents remaining 
after use to your doctor or pharmacist for proper disposal. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Disposing of used syringes </p>
<p>Put used syringes into a puncture-proof container and keep it out of the reach and sight of children. </p>
<p>Dispose the puncture-proof container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Do not put used syringes into the normal household garbage bin. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe, 
wait for the area to dry and pinch the skin 
between your thumb and forefinger, without 
squeezing it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the needle fully into the skin at an angle 
of about 45 , as shown in the picture. </p>
</li>
</ol>         </div>"""
