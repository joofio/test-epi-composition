adolescents 12 years of age and older. Alopecia areata is a disease where the body s own immune 
system attacks hair follicles, causing inflammation that leads to hair loss on the scalp, face and/or 
other parts of the body.   </p>
<p>Litfulo works by reducing the activity of enzymes called JAK3 and TEC kinases, which are involved 
in inflammation at the hair follicle. This reduces the inflammation, leading to hair regrowth in patients 
with alopecia areata. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Litfulo 
- if you are allergic to ritlecitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).<br />
- if you have a serious infection ongoing, including tuberculosis. 
- if you have severe liver problems. 
- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see the  pregnancy, contraception, breast-feeding and 
fertility  section). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before and during treatment with Litfulo if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an infection (possible signs may be fever, sweating, chills, muscle aches, cough, shortness 
of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, diarrhoea, stomach pain, burning when you 
urinate, urinating more often than usual, feeling very tired). Litfulo can reduce your body s 
ability to fight infections and so worsen an existing infection or make it more likely for you to 
get a new infection. </li>
<li>if you have diabetes or are older than 65 years of age, you may have an increased risk of getting 
infections. </li>
<li>have, or have had, tuberculosis or have been in close contact with someone with tuberculosis, or 
if you reside or travel in regions where tuberculosis is very common. Your doctor will test you 
for tuberculosis before starting Litfulo and may retest you during treatment. </li>
<li>have ever had a herpes infection (such as chickenpox or shingles), because Litfulo may allow it 
to come back. Tell your doctor if you get a painful skin rash with blisters as this can be a sign of 
shingles. </li>
<li>have ever had hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Your doctor will test you for hepatitis before starting 
Litfulo and may retest you during treatment. </li>
<li>have cancer or have had any cancer   it is not clear if Litfulo increases the risk of cancer, and 
your doctor will discuss with you if treatment with this medicine is appropriate and whether 
check-ups including regular skin checks will be necessary during treatment.  </li>
<li>have had blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary 
embolism). Tell your doctor if you get a painful swollen leg, chest pain, or shortness of breath 
as these can be signs of blood clots in the veins. </li>
<li>have had blood clots in an artery in the eye (retinal occlusion) or heart (heart attack). Tell your 
doctor if you experience acute changes to your eyesight (blurry vision, partial or complete loss 
of vision), chest pain, shortness of breath as these changes may be a sign of blood clots in the 
arteries.  </li>
<li>have recently had or plan to have a vaccination (immunisation)   this is because certain 
vaccines (live vaccines) are not recommended while using Litfulo. Check with your doctor to 
see if your vaccinations are up to date and if you require additional vaccinations, including 
vaccination for shingles, before treatment with Litfulo. </li>
<li>have unexplained symptoms caused by a problem with the nervous system while taking Litfulo. 
Your doctor will discuss with you if treatment should be discontinued.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional monitoring tests </p>
<p>Your doctor will carry out blood tests to check if you have low white blood cell count or low platelet 
count before and approximately 4 weeks after starting Litfulo treatment and may adjust your treatment 
if necessary. </p>
<p>Children<br />
This medicine is not approved for use in children below the age of 12 years because the safety and 
benefits of Litfulo are not established in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Litfulo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Litfulo if you are taking some of the 
medicines to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>anxiety or sleep disorders (such as midazolam),  </li>
<li>heart rhythm problems (such as quinidine),  </li>
<li>gout (such as colchicine),  </li>
<li>rejection in organ transplantation (such as cyclosporine, everolimus, tacrolimus and sirolimus), </li>
<li>migraine (such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine),  </li>
<li>schizophrenia and chronic psychosis (such as pimozide),  </li>
<li>asthma (such as theophylline),  </li>
<li>muscle spasms (such as tizanidine),  </li>
<li>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (such as pirfenidone).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Litfulo may increase the amount of these medicines in your blood.  </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Litfulo. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Contraception in women </p>
<p>If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you should use an effective method of contraception 
during treatment with Litfulo, and for at least one month after your last treatment dose. Your doctor 
can advise you on suitable methods of contraception.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Do not use Litfulo if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. This 
medicine can harm the developing baby. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant or think 
you might have become pregnant during treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not use Litfulo while breast-feeding as it is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk or if 
breast-fed babies are affected. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>It is unknown if Litfulo reduces fertility in women or men of childbearing potential.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Litfulo has no or limited effect on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Litfulo contains lactose<br />
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
