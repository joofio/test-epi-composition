  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What is Livmarli 
Livmarli contains the active substance maralixibat. It helps to remove substances called bile acids 
from the body.  </p>
<p>Bile acids are found in digestive fluid called bile which is produced by the liver. Bile acids move from 
the liver into the gut, where they help with digesting food. After helping with digestion, they move 
back into the liver. </p>
<p>What is Livmarli used for 
Livmarli is used to treat cholestatic pruritus in patients aged 2 months and older who have Alagille 
syndrome (ALGS).  </p>
<p>ALGS is a rare genetic disease that can lead to a build-up of bile acids in the liver. This is called 
cholestasis. Cholestasis may get worse over time and often causes severe itching, fatty deposits under 
the skin (xanthomas), poor growth and feeling tired. </p>
<p>How does Livmarli (maralixibat) work 
Maralixibat works by reducing build-up of bile acids in the liver. It does this by blocking the bile acids 
from being taken back to the liver once they have done their job in the intestines. This allows bile 
acids to pass out of the body in stools. </p>         </div>"""

- if you or your child are allergic to maralixibat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor if your diarrhoea gets worse while taking Livmarli. If you get diarrhoea, drink 
plenty of liquids so you do not become dehydrated. </p>
<p>Increased levels in liver enzymes might be seen in liver function tests when taking Livmarli. Before 
you start taking Livmarli, your doctor will measure your liver function to check how well your liver is 
working. Your doctor will do regular checks to monitor your liver function. </p>
<p>Your doctor may do blood tests before starting and during treatment with Livmarli to check your INR 
(international normalised ratio; a laboratory test to monitor your risk for bleeding) and your levels of 
certain vitamins stored in body fat (vitamin A, D, E, and K). If your vitamin levels are low, your 
doctor may recommend that you take vitamins. </p>
<p>Some illnesses, medicines or operations may affect how fast food moves through the gut. They can 
also affect how bile acids move between the liver and the gut. This can affect how well maralixibat 
works. Make sure your doctor knows about any illnesses, medicines or operations you have had. </p>
<p>Children<br />
Livmarli is not recommended for children under 2 months of age. This is because it is not known yet 
whether it is safe and effective in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Livmarli 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
- Fluvastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin (medicines used to treat high levels of cholesterol in the 
blood) 
- Midazolam (a medicine used for sedation or to induce sleep) 
- Ursodeoxycholic acid (a medicine used to treat liver disease) </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. If you are pregnant, it is better not to 
take Livmarli.  </p>
<p>Livmarli can be used if you are breast-feeding. It does not get into your bloodstream and therefore is 
not expected to get into your breast milk. However, always follow your doctor’s advice. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Livmarli has no or very minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Livmarli contains propylene glycol and sodium 
This medicine contains 364.5 mg propylene glycol in each mL. This is equal to about 10 mcg/kg. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""
