  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What is Livmarli 
Livmarli contains the active substance maralixibat. It helps to remove substances called bile acids 
from the body.  </p>
<p>Bile acids are found in digestive fluid called bile which is produced by the liver. Bile acids move from 
the liver into the gut, where they help with digesting food. After helping with digestion, they move 
back into the liver. </p>
<p>What is Livmarli used for 
Livmarli is used to treat cholestatic pruritus in patients aged 2 months and older who have Alagille 
syndrome (ALGS).  </p>
<p>ALGS is a rare genetic disease that can lead to a build-up of bile acids in the liver. This is called 
cholestasis. Cholestasis may get worse over time and often causes severe itching, fatty deposits under 
the skin (xanthomas), poor growth and feeling tired. </p>
<p>How does Livmarli (maralixibat) work 
Maralixibat works by reducing build-up of bile acids in the liver. It does this by blocking the bile acids 
from being taken back to the liver once they have done their job in the intestines. This allows bile 
acids to pass out of the body in stools. </p>         </div>"""

- if you or your child are allergic to maralixibat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor if your diarrhoea gets worse while taking Livmarli. If you get diarrhoea, drink 
plenty of liquids so you do not become dehydrated. </p>
<p>Increased levels in liver enzymes might be seen in liver function tests when taking Livmarli. Before 
you start taking Livmarli, your doctor will measure your liver function to check how well your liver is 
working. Your doctor will do regular checks to monitor your liver function. </p>
<p>Your doctor may do blood tests before starting and during treatment with Livmarli to check your INR 
(international normalised ratio; a laboratory test to monitor your risk for bleeding) and your levels of 
certain vitamins stored in body fat (vitamin A, D, E, and K). If your vitamin levels are low, your 
doctor may recommend that you take vitamins. </p>
<p>Some illnesses, medicines or operations may affect how fast food moves through the gut. They can 
also affect how bile acids move between the liver and the gut. This can affect how well maralixibat 
works. Make sure your doctor knows about any illnesses, medicines or operations you have had. </p>
<p>Children<br />
Livmarli is not recommended for children under 2 months of age. This is because it is not known yet 
whether it is safe and effective in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Livmarli 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluvastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin (medicines used to treat high levels of cholesterol in the 
blood) </li>
<li>Midazolam (a medicine used for sedation or to induce sleep) </li>
<li>Ursodeoxycholic acid (a medicine used to treat liver disease) </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. If you are pregnant, it is better not to 
take Livmarli.  </p>
<p>Livmarli can be used if you are breast-feeding. It does not get into your bloodstream and therefore is 
not expected to get into your breast milk. However, always follow your doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Livmarli has no or very minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Livmarli contains propylene glycol and sodium 
This medicine contains 364.5 mg propylene glycol in each mL. This is equal to about 10 mcg/kg. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much to take 
* The dose of Livmarli you are given is based on your weight. Your doctor will calculate your 
dose and tell you how much to take and which oral syringe size to use.<br />
* The target dose is 380 micrograms of maralixibat for each kilogram body weight once daily. 
* The starting dose is 190 micrograms for each kilogram body weight once daily. </p>
<ul>
<li>This dose will be increased to 380 micrograms for each kilogram body weight once daily after 
one week. Your doctor will tell you when you can increase the dose. They will also tell you how 
much to take and which syringe size to use for the higher dose. </li>
</ul>
<p>Taking this medicine 
You can take Livmarli together with food or on an empty stomach up to 30 minutes before eating, in 
the morning. </p>
<p>Give the dose into the mouth using the oral syringe, and swallow it (see Figure M). <br />
Do not mix the oral solution with food or drinks. </p>

<p>How to take a dose of this medicine </p>
<p>Step 1: Draw dose </p>
<p>1.1<br />
To open the bottle, remove the child-resistant closure by pushing down firmly while turning left 
(anti-clockwise) (see Figure A). Do not throw away the child-resistant closure as you will need 
to put it back when you have taken out the dose you need. </p>
<p>Figure A </p>
<p>1.2<br />
Make sure you use the correct oral syringe size for your prescribed dose (see table above). Your 
doctor will tell you which syringe size you should use. 
* If using a new oral syringe, remove it from the wrapper (see Figure B). Throw away the 
wrapper in the household waste. 
* If using a previously used oral syringe, make sure it has been cleaned and is dry (see 2.4 
for instructions for cleaning). </p>
<p>Figure B </p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a cap on the oral syringe, remove it and throw it away in the household waste 
(see Figure C). </li>
</ul>
<p>Figure C </p>
<p>The syringe has dose markings on the barrel. One end of the syringe has a tip that is used to 
insert into the medicine bottle. The other end of the syringe has a flange and a plunger, used to 
push the medicine out of the syringe to give the medicine (see Figure D).  </p>
<p>Figure D </p>
<p>1.3<br />
Push the plunger down fully to remove air from the syringe (see Figure E). </p>
<p>Figure E </p>
<p>1.4<br />
Make sure that the closure is removed from the bottle and insert the tip of the syringe into the 
upright bottle. The tip of the syringe should fit snugly into the hole of the bottle (see Figure F). </p>
<p>Figure F </p>
<p>1.5<br />
With the syringe in place, turn the bottle upside down (see Figure G).  </p>
<p>Figure G </p>
<p>1.6<br />
To withdraw a dose from the bottle, slowly pull back on the plunger until the plunger 
lines up with the marking on the barrel of the syringe that matches the prescribed dose </p>
<p>(see Figure H). There are two kinds of plungers that you might receive with the syringe: a flat 
tip plunger or a pointy tip plunger (see Figure I under 1.6). See Figure I on how to align the 
plunger with your prescribed dose. For a flat tip plunger, the flat end of the plunger should be 
aligned with the marking on the barrel that matches the prescribed dose (Figure I.a.). For a clear 
pointy tip plunger, make sure that the flat, wide part below the tip is lined up with the correct 
marking (Figure I.b.).  </p>

Check the syringe for air bubbles. If you see any air bubbles: 
* Push the air bubbles back into the bottle by pushing the plunger (see Figure J)<br />
* then re-draw the prescribed dose following the instructions in Step 1.</p>         </div>"""

Carefully remove the syringe from the bottle (see Figure L), holding the bottle firmly in one 
hand and holding the syringe by the barrel in the other hand.<br />

<p>Step 2: Give the dose </p>
<p>Note: You or your child should stay upright while taking the dose and for a few minutes after. </p>
<p>2.1<br />
Insert the tip of the oral syringe against the inside of the cheek (see Figure M). 
Slowly press the plunger all the way down to fully and gently squirt the oral solution into the 
mouth (see Figure N). </p>

To close the bottle, screw the child-resistant closure back on the bottle by turning to the right 
(clockwise) (see Figure O). </p>
