<p>Read the list of medicines below under ‘Other medicines and Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan’ for 
information on certain other medicines which require special care.  </p>
<p>If you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about making necessary changes either in 
the treatment for your other condition(s) or in your antiretroviral treatment.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan. </p>
<p>Important information  </p>
<p>−<br />
People taking lopinavir/ritonavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
disease and AIDS. It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while 
taking lopinavir/ritonavir.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your child have/had  </p>
<p>−<br />
Haemophilia type A and B as lopinavir/ritonavir might increase the risk of bleeding.<br />
−<br />
Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.<br />
−<br />
A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B or 
C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your child experience  </p>
<p>−<br />
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in the legs 
and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels.<br />
−<br />
Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels in the 
blood.<br />
−<br />
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the blood) 
have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and these symptoms 
may suggest this condition.<br />
In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and 
symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.<br />
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, </p>
<p>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.<br />
−<br />
Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement 
as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral 
therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression (reduction in the activity 
of the immune system), higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors 
for developing this disease.<br />
−<br />
Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines. On rare 
occasions these muscle disorders have been serious.<br />
−<br />
Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats. 
Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart. 
These changes may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).  </p>
