information on certain other medicines which require special care.  </p>
<p>If you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about making necessary changes either in 
the treatment for your other condition(s) or in your antiretroviral treatment.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan. </p>
<p>Important information  </p>
<p>People taking lopinavir/ritonavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
disease and AIDS. It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor while 
taking lopinavir/ritonavir.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your child have/had  </p>
<p>Haemophilia type A and B as lopinavir/ritonavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  </p>
<p>Diabetes as increased blood sugars has been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.  </p>
<p>A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B or 
C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your child experience  </p>
<p>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in the legs 
and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels.  </p>
<p>Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels in the 
blood.  </p>
<p>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the blood) 
have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and these symptoms 
may suggest this condition.<br />
In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and 
symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.<br />
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, </p>
<p>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.  </p>
<p>Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement 
as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral 
therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression (reduction in the activity 
of the immune system), higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors 
for developing this disease.  </p>
<p>Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines. On rare 
occasions these muscle disorders have been serious.  </p>
<p>Symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or sensation of abnormal heartbeats. 
Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart. 
These changes may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. </p>

venetoclax, most tyrosine kinases inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib, also vincristine and 
vinblastine);  </p>

you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also  Do not take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan  above);  </p>
<p>anti tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline, delamanid); </p>
<p>antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir);  </p>

<p>HIV CCR5-antagonist (e.g. maraviroc);  </p>

<p>medicines used to lower blood cholesterol (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin);  </p>
<p>medicines used to treat asthma and other lung-related problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) (e.g. salmeterol);  </p>
<p>medicines used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery) 
(e.g. bosentan, riociguat, sildenafil, tadalafil);  </p>

<p>pain-relieving medicines (e.g. fentanyl);  </p>

<p>Read the list of medicines above  Do not take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan with any of the following 
medicines  for information on medicines that you must not take with lopinavir/ritonavir.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription. </p>

<p>Do not take lopinavir/ritonavir if you are currently taking avanafil or vardenafil.  </p>
<p>You must not take lopinavir/ritonavir with sildenafil used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery) (see also Do not take Lopinavir/Ritonavir Mylan 
section above).  </p>
<p>If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and lopinavir/ritonavir together, you may be at risk of side effects 
such as low blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours. 
If an erection lasts longer than 4 hours, you should get medical help immediately to avoid permanent 
damage to your penis. Your doctor can explain these symptoms to you. </p>
<p>Contraceptives  </p>
<p>If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, 
you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as lopinavir/ritonavir 
may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives.   </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you are planning to have a baby, you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding or thinking about breast-feeding,  you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.   </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended  in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Lopinavir/ritonavir has not specifically been tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or 
operate machines. Do not drive a car or operate machinery if you experience any side effects (e.g. nausea) 
that impact your ability to do so safely. Instead, contact your doctor. </p>
