Lorviqua contains the active substance lorlatinib, a medicine that is used for treatment of adults with 
advanced stages of a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lorviqua 
belongs to the group of medicines that inhibit an enzyme called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). 
Lorviqua is only given to patients who have an alteration in the ALK gene, see How Lorviqua works
below. 
What Lorviqua is used for
Lorviqua is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
It is used if your lung cancer:
-
is ALK-positive   this means your cancer cells have a fault in a gene that makes an enzyme 
called ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), see How Lorviqua works, below; and 
-
is advanced. 
Lorviqua can be prescribed to you if:
-
you have not been previously treated with an ALK inhibitor; or
-
you have been previously treated with a medicine called alectinib or ceritinib, which are ALK
inhibitors; or 
-
you have been previously treated with crizotinib followed by another ALK inhibitor.
How Lorviqua works
Lorviqua inhibits a type of enzyme called tyrosine kinase and triggers the death of cancer cells in 
patients with alterations in genes for ALK. Lorviqua is only given to patients whose disease is due to 
an alteration in the gene for ALK tyrosine kinase.
If you have any questions about how Lorviqua works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
-
Contraception   information for women
You should not become pregnant while taking this medicine. If you are able to have children, 
you must use highly effective contraception (for example, double-barrier contraception such as 
condom and diaphragm) while on treatment and for at least 5 weeks after stopping treatment. 
Lorlatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive methods (for example, birth 
control pill); therefore, hormonal contraceptives may not be considered highly effective. If 
hormonal contraception is unavoidable it must be used in combination with a condom. Talk to 
your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner.
-
Contraception   information for men
You should not father children during treatment with Lorviqua because this medicine could 
harm the baby. If there is any possibility that you may father a child while taking this medicine, 
you must use a condom during treatment, and for at least 14 weeks after completing therapy. 
Talk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner.
-
Pregnancy</p>
<p>Do not take Lorviqua if you are pregnant. This is because it may harm your baby. </p>
<p>If your male partner is being treated with Lorviqua, he must use a condom during treatment 
and for at least 14 weeks after completing therapy. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant when taking the medicine or during the 5 weeks after taking your 
last dose, tell your doctor straight away. 
-
Breast-feeding
Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine and for 7 days after the last dose. This is because 
it is not known if Lorviqua can pass into breast milk and could therefore harm your baby.
-

Lorviqua.
