or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>

coating to make sure that they pass through your stomach and only break up in your intestines to 
release the methylthioninium chloride that stains the colon blue. You must not crush or chew them. </p>

must all be taken over a period of 2 hours, the night before your colonoscopy. Your doctor will explain 
how you should take the tablets, which are normally taken together with a bowel cleansing preparation 
(a medicine to clear out your colon).  </p>
<p>Take the tablets as instructed by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Typical instructions are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After drinking at least 1 litre of the bowel cleansing preparation (or water) take the first dose of 
3 tablets. </p>
