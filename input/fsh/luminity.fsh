the active substance. 
Luminity is for diagnostic use only. It is a contrast agent (a medicine that helps to make internal body 
structures visible during imaging tests). 
Luminity is used in adults to obtain a clearer scan of the chambers of the heart, especially of the left 
ventricle, during echocardiography (a diagnostic test where an image of the heart is obtained using 
ultrasound). Luminity is used in patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease 
(obstruction of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle), when the image obtained with non-
contrast echocardiography is not optimal. </p>         </div>"""

- if you have severe heart or lung diseases or if you need mechanical help to breathe 
- if you have an artificial valve in your heart 
- if you have an acute severe inflammation/sepsis 
- if you have known hyperactive coagulation system (blood clotting issues) or recurrent 
thromboembolism (blood clots) 
- if you have a liver disease 
- if you have a kidney disease 
- if you have sickle cell disease 
- if you have had an allergic reaction in the past with polyethylene glycol </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Luminity should not be used in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) as it has not been 
studied in these groups </p>
<p>Other medicines and Luminity 
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding and ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice 
before you are given Luminity.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines

<p>Luminity contains sodium. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially  sodium-free . </p>
<p>Luminity contains propylene glycol. 
This medicine contains 103.5 mg/ml propylene glycol, which is equivalent to 182.2mg in each vial. </p>         </div>"""

you. </p>
<p>Luminity is for intravenous use (direct injection into the vein). Before use, this medicine must be 
activated by shaking it using a mechanical device called Vialmix, which is supplied to doctors who 
need to prepare the medicine. This ensures that the medicine is shaken in the correct way and for long 
enough to make up a  dispersion  of microspheres of perflutren gas of the right size to get a good 
quality image.  </p>
<p>Luminity is then given into a vein either as a  bolus  injection (given all at once) or as an infusion 
(drip solution) after being diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) 
solution for injection. In some cases, your doctor may choose to use two injections to complete the 
ultrasound examination.  The way Luminity is given and the dose depend on the technique used for the 
echocardiography. </p>

Overdose is not likely to happen since the medicine is administered by a doctor. In the case of 
overdose the doctor will take appropriate action. </p>         </div>"""
