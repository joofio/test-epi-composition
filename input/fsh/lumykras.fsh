antineoplastic agents (cancer medicines). </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) when it is advanced and has spread to other parts of the body. </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS is used when previous treatments were not effective in stopping the growth of the 
cancer, and when the cancer cells have a genetic change that allows them to produce an abnormal form 
of protein called KRAS G12C. Your doctor will test your cancer cells for this change beforehand to 
make sure that LUMYKRAS is right for you. </p>
<p>How does LUMYKRAS work? </p>
<p>The abnormal KRAS G12C protein, acts to help make cancer cells grow out of control. LUMYKRAS 
attaches to the protein and stops it from working, which may slow down or stop the growth of the 
cancer. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how LUMYKRAS works or why this medicine has been prescribed 
for you, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to sotorasib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking LUMYKRAS. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have a history of liver problems. Your doctor may carry 
out blood tests to check your liver function, and may decide to either reduce the dose of LUMYKRAS 
or stop your treatment. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any other lung problems. Some lung problems may get worse 
during treatment with LUMYKRAS, as LUMYKRAS may cause inflammation of the lungs during 
treatment. Symptoms may be similar to those from lung cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you 
have any new or worsening symptoms including difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, or cough 
with or without mucous, or fever. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS has not been studied in children or adolescents. Treatment with LUMYKRAS is not 
recommended in persons under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and LUMYKRAS </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, vitamins and herbal supplements. 
This is because LUMYKRAS can affect the way some other medicines work, and some other 
medicines can affect the way LUMYKRAS works. </p>
<p>The following medicines may reduce how well LUMYKRAS works: 
* Medicines used to reduce stomach acid and to treat stomach ulcers, indigestion and heartburn 
(see section 3) such as: 
-  dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole sodium, or 
rabeprazole (medicines known as ‘proton pump inhibitors’) 
-  ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine (medicines known as ‘H2 receptor antagonists’) 
* Rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) 
* Medicines used to treat epilepsy called phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine (also used to 
treat nerve pain) 
* St. John’s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression) 
* Enzalutamide (used to treat prostate cancer) </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS may reduce how well the following medicines work: 
* Medicines used to treat severe pain, such as alfentanil or fentanyl 
* Medicines used in organ transplantation to prevent organ rejection, such as cyclosporine, 
sirolimus, everolimus, or tacrolimus 
* Medicines used to reduce cholesterol levels, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, or lovastatin 
* Midazolam (used to treat acute seizures or as a sedative before or during surgery or medical 
procedures) 
* Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems, such as dronedarone or amiodarone 
* Medicines known as anticoagulants that stop your blood clotting, such as rivaroxaban or 
apixaban </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS may increase the risk for side effects with the following medicines:<br />
* Medicines used to treat certain cancers or inflammatory conditions, such as methotrexate, 
mitoxantrone, topotecan or lapatinib 
* Medicines used to treat heart failure, such as digoxin 
* Medicines used to lower cholesterol, such as rosuvastatin </p>
<p>Contraception </p>
<p>If you take LUMYKRAS whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may be ineffective. 
In addition, you should use another reliable method of birth control such as a barrier method (e.g. 
condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine. Talk to your doctor about 
the right methods of contraception for you and your partner. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not become pregnant while taking this medicine because the effects of LUMYKRAS in 
pregnant women are not known, it could harm the baby. If you are able to become pregnant, you must 
use highly effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 7 days after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine and for 7 days after the last dose. This is because it is 
not known whether the ingredients in LUMYKRAS pass into breast milk and could therefore harm 
your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS has no marked influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS contains lactose </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>LUMYKRAS contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- free’. </p>         </div>"""

Your doctor or pharmacist may decrease the dose or stop your medicine depending on how well you 
tolerate it. 
* The recommended dose is eight tablets (960 mg) once a day. Take your daily dose of 
LUMYKRAS by mouth once a day, at the same time each day. 
* LUMYKRAS can be taken with or without food. 
* Swallow the tablets whole. You can disperse the tablets in water but do not chew, crush, or split 
the tablets. 
* If you cannot swallow LUMYKRAS tablets whole: 
- Place your daily dose of LUMYKRAS in half a glass (not less than 120 mL) of plain, 
room temperature drinking water, without crushing the tablets. Do not use any other 
liquids, including acidic beverages (e.g. fruit juices). 
- Swirl gently until the tablets are in small pieces (the tablets will not dissolve completely). 
The appearance of the mixture may range from pale to bright yellow. 
-  Drink the mixture right away. 
- Rinse the glass with an additional half a glass of water and drink right away to make sure 
that you have taken the full dose of LUMYKRAS. 
-  If you do not drink all of the mixture immediately, stir the mixture again before you finish 
drinking it. Drink all of the mixture within two hours of preparation. 
* If necessary, your doctor may recommend you receive LUMYKRAS through a feeding tube. </p>
<p>If you need to take a medicine to reduce stomach acid such as a proton pump inhibitor or an H2 
receptor antagonist, take LUMYKRAS with an acidic beverage (such as cola) . Alternatively, you may 
use a local antacid (such as magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) and, in that case, 
LUMYKRAS should be taken either 4 hours before or 10 hours after that medicine (see section 2). </p>
<p>If you take more LUMYKRAS than you should </p>
<p>Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you take more tablets than recommended. </p>

<p>If you vomit after taking a dose of LUMYKRAS, do not take an extra dose. Take your next dose at 
your regular scheduled time. </p>
<p>If you forget to take LUMYKRAS </p>
<p>If you forget to take a dose of LUMYKRAS at your regular scheduled time, and less than 6 hours have 
passed, take your dose as normal. If more than 6 hours have passed from your regular scheduled time, 
do not take the dose. Take your next dose at your regular scheduled time the next day. </p>         </div>"""
