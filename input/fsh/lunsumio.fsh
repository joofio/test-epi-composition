  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Lunsumio contains the active substance mosunetuzumab, which is a type of antibody. This is a cancer 
medicine. It is used to treat adults who have a blood cancer called follicular lymphoma (FL).  </p>
<p>In FL, a type of white blood cells called  B cells  become cancerous. The abnormal B cells do not 
work properly and grow too quickly, crowding out the normal B cells in the bone marrow and lymph 
nodes that help protect you from infection. </p>
<p>Lunsumio is given to patients who have tried at least two previous treatments for FL, when either the 
cancer has not responded to them, or it has come back again. </p>
<p>How Lunsumio works </p>
<p>The active substance in Lunsumio, mosunetuzumab, is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that 
attaches to specific targets in the body. In this case, mosunetuzumab attaches to a target substance 
found on B cells, including the cancerous B cells, and another target found on  T cells , a different 
type of white blood cell. T cells are another part of the body s defences that can destroy invading cells. 
By attaching the two cells together like a bridge, Lunsumio encourages the T cells to destroy the 
cancerous B cells. This helps control the FL and prevent its spread. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to mosunetuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Lunsumio. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Lunsumio if any of the following apply to you (or 
you are not sure):<br />
<em> you have ever had heart, lung or kidney problems<br />
</em> you have an infection, or have had an infection in the past which lasted a long time or keeps 
coming back 
* you are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of any of the side effects listed below during or 
after treatment with Lunsumio. You may need additional medical treatment. The symptoms of each 
side effect are listed in section 4. * Cytokine release syndrome   a condition associated with medicines that stimulate T cells.  </p>
<p>Before each infusion, you may be given medicines, which help reduce possible side 
effects of cytokine release syndrome.<br />
* Tumour lysis syndrome   some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the 
blood   caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment.  </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each infusion, 
you should be well-hydrated and may be given medicines that can help reduce high levels 
of uric acid. These may help reduce possible side effects of tumour lysis syndrome.<br />
<em> Tumour flare   as your cancer is destroyed, it may react and appear to get worse   this is called 
 tumour flare reaction .<br />
</em> Infections   you may get signs of infection, which can vary depending on where in the 
body the infection is. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents under the age of 18. This is because there 
is no information about use in this age group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lunsumio  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>It is important to tell your doctor before and during treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. This is because Lunsumio may affect your unborn baby.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use Lunsumio during pregnancy, unless after discussion with your doctor, it is agreed 
that the benefits of treatment outweigh any risk to the unborn baby. </li>
</ul>
<p>Contraception </p>
<p>Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment   and for 
3 months after the last dose of Lunsumio.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception. 
Breast-feeding  </li>
</ul>
<p>You must not breast-feed during and for at least 3 months after your last treatment. This is because it is 
not known whether any Lunsumio passes into breast milk and could therefore affect the baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>Lunsumio has minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
any symptoms that may affect your ability to drive, do not drive, cycle or use tools or machines until 
the reaction stops. See section 4 for more information about side effects. </p>         </div>"""

treatment schedule explained to you by your doctor. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How Lunsumio is given </p>
<p>It is given into a vein, as a drip (infusion). 
* It is given over 4 hours during the first cycle. Each cycle is 21 days and in the first cycle, you 
will be given the 4 hour infusion on day 1, day 8 and day 15. * If side effects are not too severe, the dose may be given over 2 hours during the 
following cycles. </p>
<p>Medicines given before Lunsumio treatment  </p>
<p>You may be given other medicines 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Lunsumio. This is to help 
prevent infusion reactions and fever. These other medicines may include: 
* Corticosteroids   such as dexamethasone or methylprednisolone 
* Paracetamol<br />
* An antihistamine - such as diphenhydramine </p>
<p>How much Lunsumio is given  </p>
<p>Lunsumio is normally given in cycles of 21 days. The recommended treatment duration is at least 
8 treatment cycles. However, depending on side effects and how the disease responds to treatment, you 
may be given up to 17 cycles.  </p>
<p>In cycle 1, you will be given 3 doses of Lunsumio in the 21 days: 
* Day 1: 1 mg 
* Day 8: 2 mg 
* Day 15: 60 mg </p>
<p>In cycle 2, you will be given just one dose:<br />
* Day 1: 60 mg </p>
<p>In cycles 3 to 17, you will be given just one dose:<br />
* Day 1: 30 mg </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Lunsumio </p>
<p>If you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it 
is very important not to miss a dose. </p>
<p>If you stop receiving Lunsumio </p>
<p>Do not stop treatment with Lunsumio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because 
stopping treatment may make your condition worse.  </p>
