of age with lupus nephritis (inflammation of the kidney caused by lupus). </p>
<p>The active ingredient in Lupkynis is one of a group of medicines known as calcineurin inhibitors that 
can be used to control your body s immune response (immunosuppressants). In lupus, the immune 
system (the body s natural defences) mistakenly attacks parts of your own body, including the kidneys 
(lupus nephritis). By reducing the response of the immune system, the medicine reduces inflammation 
of your kidneys and lessens symptoms such as swelling of the legs, ankles or feet, high blood pressure, 
tiredness, as well as improving your kidney function. </p>         </div>"""
