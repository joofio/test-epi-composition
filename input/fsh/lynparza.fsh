  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Lynparza is and how it works
Lynparza contains the active substance olaparib. Olaparib is a type of cancer medicine called a PARP 
inhibitor (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase inhibitor).
PARP inhibitors can destroy cancer cells that are not good at repairing DNA damage. These specific 
cancer cells can be identified by:</p>
<p>response to platinum chemotherapy, or</p>
<p>looking for faulty DNA repair genes, such as BRCA (BReast CAncer) genes.
When Lynparza is used in combination with abiraterone (an androgen receptor signalling inhibitor), 
the combination may help enhance anti-cancer effect in prostate cancer cells with or without faulty 
DNA repair genes (e.g., BRCA genes).
What Lynparza is used for
Lynparza is used for the treatment of</p>
<p>a type of ovarian cancer (BRCA-mutated) that has responded to the first treatment with 
standard platinum-based chemotherapy.  * A test is used to find out whether you have BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>ovarian cancer that has come back (recurred). It can be used after the cancer has responded 
to previous treatment with standard platinum-based chemotherapy. </p>
<p>a type of ovarian cancer (HRD positive as defined by a BRCA mutation or genomic 
instability) that has responded to the first treatment with standard platinum-based 
chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Lynparza is used together with bevacizumab.
  a type of breast cancer (BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative) when the cancer has not spread 
to other parts of the body and treatment is going to be given after surgery (treatment 
after surgery is called adjuvant therapy). You should have received chemotherapy 
medicines before or after surgery.  If your cancer is hormone-receptor positive your 
doctor may also prescribe hormonal treatment. * A test is used to find out whether you have BRCA-mutated breast cancer.</p>
<p>a type of breast cancer (BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative) which has spread beyond the 
original tumour. You should have received chemotherapy medicines either before or after your 
cancer has spread.  * A test is used to find out whether you have BRCA-mutated breast cancer.</p>
<p>a type of pancreatic cancer (BRCA-mutated) that has responded to the first treatment with 
standard platinum-based chemotherapy.  * A test is used to find out whether you have BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>a type of prostate cancer (BRCA-mutated) which has spread beyond the original tumour 
and no longer responds to medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone. You should 
have received certain hormonal treatments, such as enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate.  * A test is used to find out whether you have BRCA-mutated prostate cancer.</p>
<p>a type of prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) beyond 
the original tumour and no longer responds to a medical or surgical treatment that lowers 
testosterone. Lynparza is used in combination with another anti-cancer medicine called 
abiraterone, together with the steroid medicine, prednisone or prednisolone.
When Lynparza is given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines it is important that you also 
read the package leaflets of these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, 
ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to olaparib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)</p>
<p>if you are breast-feeding (see section 2 below for more information).
Do not take Lynparza if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before taking Lynparza.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or during treatment with Lynparza</p>
<p>if you have low blood cell counts on testing. These may be low counts for red or white blood 
cells, or low platelet counts. See section 4 for more information about these side effects, 
including the signs and symptoms you need to look out for (for example, fever or infection, 
bruising or bleeding). Rarely, these may be a sign of more serious problems with the bone 
marrow such as  myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS) or  acute myeloid leukaemia  (AML).</p>
<p>if you experience any new or worsening symptoms of shortness of breath, coughing or 
wheezing. A small number of patients treated with Lynparza reported inflammation of the lungs 
(pneumonitis). Pneumonitis is a serious condition that can often require hospital treatment.</p>
<p>if you experience any new or worsening symptoms of pain or swelling in an extremity, shortness 
of breath, chest pain, breathing that is more rapid than normal or heart beats faster than normal. 
A small number of patients treated with Lynparza were reported to develop a blood clot in a 
deep vein, usually in the leg (venous thrombosis), or a clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).</p>
<p>if you notice yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, abnormally dark urine (brown
coloured), pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen), tiredness, feeling less hungry
than usual or unexplained nausea and vomiting contact your doctor immediately as this may
indicate problems with your liver.
If you think any of these may apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or during 
treatment with Lynparza.

given new blood or blood-based products from a donor).
