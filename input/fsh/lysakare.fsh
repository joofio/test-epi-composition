with LysaKare, read the Lutathera leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>
<p>You should not be given LysaKare 
- if you are allergic to arginine and lysine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6). 
- If you have high blood levels of potassium (hyperkalaemia). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking LysaKare if your kidneys, heart or liver are severely impaired or if 
you have a history of high blood levels of potassium (hyperkalaemia). 
Because feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting are commonly seen with amino acid infusions, you will be 
given medicines to prevent nausea and vomitting 30 minutes before the LysaKare infusion. </p>
<p>The doctor will check your blood potassium levels, and will correct them if they are too high before 
starting the infusion. The doctor will also check your kidney and liver function before starting the 
infusion. For other tests which need to be performed before your treatment, please read the Lutathera 
leaflet. 
Follow your doctor s advice on how much fluid to drink on the day of your treatment so you stay well 
hydrated. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years old because it is not 
known whether it is safe and effective in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and LysaKare 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that LysaKare will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>         </div>"""

LysaKare is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein. The infusion of LysaKare will start 30 minutes 
before you are given Lutathera, and will last over a 4 hour period. </p>
<p>If you receive more LysaKare than you should 
LysaKare will be given in a controlled clinical setting and is provided as a single dose bag. It is
