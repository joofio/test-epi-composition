<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyxumia if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when 
the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin) since this 
medicine will not be right for you </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have or have had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have a severe stomach or gut problem such as a disease of the muscles of the stomach 
called  gastroparesis  which results in delayed stomach emptying </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have severe kidney disease, or you are on dialysis as the use of this medicine will not be 
recommended  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you are also taking a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin. This is because low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may want to control your blood sugar level and then, 
decide to reduce your dose of basal insulin or sulphonylurea. Lyxumia should not be used with a 
combination of both basal insulin and sulphonylurea </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you are taking other medicines, as there are other medicines such as antibiotics or stomach 
resistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach (see section Other 
medicines and Lyxumia) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you experience loss of fluids/dehydration,e.g., in case of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. It is 
important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, especially when starting treatment 
with Lyxumia </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you suffer from heart problems which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling, since 
there is limited experience in this population. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is no experience with Lyxumia in children and adolescents less than 18 years and therefore, the 
use of Lyxumia is not recommended in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Lyxumia 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
The effect of some medicines you swallow might be affected by Lyxumia. Some medicines such as 
antibiotics or stomach resistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach may 
need to be taken at least one hour before or four hours after your Lyxumia injection.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Lyxumia should not be used during pregnancy. It is not known if Lyxumia may harm your unborn 
child.<br />
Lyxumia should not be used if breast-feeding. It is not known if Lyxumia passes into your milk.<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
If you use Lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, you may get low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia). This may make it difficult to concentrate and you may feel dizzy or sleepy. If this 
happens do not drive or use any tools or machines. </p>

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially  sodium-free .
