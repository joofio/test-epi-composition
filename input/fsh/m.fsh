When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) will make
antibodies against the measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The antibodies help protect against
infections caused by these viruses.
M-M-RvaxPro is given to help protect you or your child against measles, mumps and rubella. The
vaccine may be administered to persons 12 months of age or older.
M-M-RvaxPro can be administered to infants from 9 to 12 months of age under special circumstances. 
M-M-RvaxPro can also be used in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or for use in
previously unvaccinated persons older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant
women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.
Although M-M-RvaxPro contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, or rubella

- if the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any measles, mumps or rubella vaccine or to any of
the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin 
- if the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month
after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding)
- if the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5  C; however,
low-grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination
- if the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis
- if the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the immune
system
- if the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the
immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy)</p>

<li>if the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including
AIDS)</li>
<li>
<p>if the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary
immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the person to be vaccinated is
demonstrated.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to the doctor or pharmacist before the person to be vaccinated receives M-M-RvaxPro if he/she
has experienced any of the following:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg</p>
</li>
<li>a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits)</li>
<li>a side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps and/or rubella vaccine that involved easy
bruising or bleeding for longer than usual</li>
<li>an infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) but do not show symptoms of HIV
disease. The vaccinated person should be monitored closely for measles, mumps and rubella
because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section Do not use
M-M-RvaxPro).
As with other vaccines, M-M-RvaxPro may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.
Also, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella
virus but is not yet ill, M-M-RvaxPro may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.
M-M-RvaxPro can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case of
measles and may be incubating the disease. However, M-M-RvaxPro may not always be able to
prevent measles developing in these cases.
Other medicines and M-M-RvaxPro
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other
medicines (or other vaccines).
The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or
administration of immune globulin (known as IG). After vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro, IG should
not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
If a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or
4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RvaxPro.
M-M-RvaxPro may be given with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine at the same visit at a separate
injection site (e.g. the other arm or leg).
M-M-RvaxPro may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at the
same time. For vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, M-M-RvaxPro should be given
1 month before or after administration of those vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
M-M-RvaxPro should not be given to pregnant females. Females of childbearing age should take the
necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month, or according to doctor s recommendation, after
they have been given the vaccine.
Persons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will decide if
M-M-RvaxPro should be given.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
There is no information to suggest that M-M-RvaxPro affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.</li>
</ul>
<p>M-M-RvaxPro contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .
M-M-RvaxPro contains potassium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
 potassium-free .
M-M-RvaxPro contains sorbitol (E 420)
This medicine contains 14.5 milligrams of sorbitol per dose. The additive effect of concomitantly
administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose)
should be taken into account. </p>         </div>"""

One dose is given at an elected date usually from 12 months of age. Under special circumstances, it
can be given from 9 months of age. Further doses should be administered according to your doctor s

Other source of information
Detailed information on this vaccine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline cake. The
solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear yellow
liquid.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use the solvent supplied.
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of
infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
Reconstitution instructions
Withdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe to be used for reconstitution and
injection. Inject the entire content of the syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to
mix thoroughly. 
The reconstituted vaccine must not be used if any particulate matter is noted or if the appearance of the
solvent or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above.
After reconstitution, it is recommended to administer the vaccine immediately to minimise loss
of potency, or within 8 hours if stored in a refrigerator. 
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.</p>
