<p>Matever is used: 
* on its own in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to 
treat a certain form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits 
(seizures). Levetiracetam is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only one 
side of the brain, but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (partial 
onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation). Levetiracetam has been given to you by 
your doctor to reduce the number of fits. 
* as an add-on to other antiepileptic medicines to treat: 
  partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in adults, adolescents, children and infants 
from one month of age 
  myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles)  in adults and 
adolescents from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy 
  primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in adults 
and adolescents from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy

<p>Warnings and precautions <br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Matever </p>
<ul>
<li>If you suffer from kidney problems, follow your doctor s instructions. He/she may decide if 
your dose should be adjusted. </li>
<li>If you notice any slowdown in the growth or unexpected puberty development of your child, 
please contact your doctor. </li>
<li>A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Matever have had thoughts 
of harming or killing themselves. If you have any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal 
ideation, please contact your doctor. </li>
<li>If you have a family or medical history of irregular heart rhythm (visible on an 
electrocardiogram), or if you have a disease and/or take a treatment that make(s) you prone to 
heartbeat irregularities or salt imbalances. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the following side effects gets serious or lasts longer than 
a few days: 
* Abnormal thoughts, feeling irritable or reacting more aggressively than usually or if you or your 
family and friends notice important changes in mood or behaviour. 
* Aggravation of epilepsy 
Your seizures may rarely become worse or happen more often, mainly during the first month 
after the start of the treatment or increase of the dose. In a very rare form of early-onset epilepsy 
(epilepsy associated with SCN8A mutations) that causes multiple types of seizures and loss of 
skills you may notice that the seizures remain present or are becoming worse during your 
treatment. </p>
<p>If you experience any of these new symptoms while taking Matever, see a doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
* Matever is not indicated in children and adolescents below 16 years on its own (monotherapy). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Matever<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not take macrogol (a medicine used as laxative) for one hour before and one hour after taking 
levetiracetam as this may results in a loss of its effect. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, only 
if after careful assessment it is considered necessary by your doctor. 
You should not stop your treatment without discussing this with your doctor. 
A risk of birth defects for your unborn child cannot be completely excluded.<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Matever may impair your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery, as it may make you feel 
sleepy. This is more likely at the beginning of treatment or after an increase in the dose. You should 
not drive or use machines until it is established that your ability to perform such activities is not 
affected. </p>
<p>Matever 250 mg, 750 mg tablets contain Sunset Yellow FCF (E110)<br />
Sunset Yellow FCF (E110) colouring agent may cause allergic reactions. 
The other strengths of Matever tablets do not contain this ingredient. </p>
<p>Matever 1000 mg tablets contain lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.

<li>
<p>Adults ( 18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: 
Recommended dose: between 1 000 mg and 3 000 mg each day. 
When you will first start taking Matever, your doctor will prescribe you a lower dose during 2 
weeks before giving you the lowest daily dose. 
Example: if your daily dose is intended to be 1 000 mg, your reduced starting dose is 1 tablet of 
250 mg in the morning and 1 tablet of 250 mg in the evening, and the dose will be gradually 
incremented to reach 1 000 mg daily after 2 weeks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or less: 
Your doctor will prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form of Matever according to 
weight and dose.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dose in infants (1 month to 23 months) and children (2 to 11 years) weighing less than kg: 
Your doctor will prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form of Matever according to 
the age, weight and dose. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Levetiracetam 100 mg/ml oral solution is a formulation more appropriate to infants and children 
under the age of 6 years and to children and adolescents (from 6 to 17 years) weighing less than 
50 kg and when tablets don t allow accurate dose. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
Swallow Matever tablets with a sufficient quantity of liquid (e.g. a glass of water). You may take 
Matever with or without food. After oral administration the bitter taste of levetiracetam may be 
experienced. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
* Matever is used as a chronic treatment. You should continue Matever treatment for as long as 
your doctor has told you. 
* Do not stop your treatment without your doctor s advice as this could increase your seizures.  </p>
<p>If you take more Matever than you should 
The possible side effects of an overdose of Matever are sleepiness, agitation, aggression, decrease of 
alertness, inhibition of breathing and coma. 
Contact your doctor if you took more tablets than you should. Your doctor will establish the best 
possible treatment of overdose. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Matever 
Contact your doctor if you have missed one or more doses.<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.  </p>
<p>If you stop taking Matever 
If stopping treatment Matever should be discontinued gradually to avoid an increase of seizures. 
Should your doctor decide to stop your Matever treatment, he/she will instruct you about the gradual 
withdrawal of Matever. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
