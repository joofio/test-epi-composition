<p>if you are allergic to cladribine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in

<li>
<p>if you are HIV positive, meaning you are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus

<li>
<p>if you have active tuberculosis or liver inflammation (hepatitis). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a weakened immune system due to medical conditions or because you are taking 
other medicines that weaken your immune system or reduce the production of blood cells in 
your bone marrow. These include: </p>
</li>
<li>ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine (used to suppress the immune system, 
for example after organ transplantation); </li>
<li>methotrexate (used to treat conditions such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis); </li>
<li>

<p>if you have moderate or severe kidney problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also 'Pregnancy and breast-feeding'). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not take MAVENCLAD and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure if any of the 
above applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking MAVENCLAD. </p>
<p>Blood tests </p>
<p>You will have blood tests before you start treatment to check that you can take MAVENCLAD. The 
doctor will also do blood tests during and after treatment to check that you can continue to take 
MAVENCLAD, and that you are not developing any complications from the treatment. </p>
<p>Infections </p>
<p>You will be tested to see if you have any infections before you start MAVENCLAD treatment. It is 
important to talk to your doctor if you think you have an infection. Symptoms of infections can 
include: fever, aching, painful muscles, headache, generally feeling unwell or yellowing of the eyes. 
Your doctor may delay treatment, or interrupt it, until the infection clears up. </p>
<p>Shingles </p>
<p>If necessary, you will be vaccinated against shingles before you start treatment. You will need to wait 
between 4 and 6 weeks for the vaccination to take effect. Tell your doctor immediately if you get 
symptoms of shingles, a common complication of MAVENCLAD (see section 4), which may need 
specific treatment. </p>
<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) </p>
<p>If you believe your MS is getting worse or if you notice any new symptoms, for example changes in 
mood or behaviour, memory lapses, speech and communication difficulties, talk to your doctor as 
soon as possible. These may be the symptoms of a rare brain disorder caused by infection and called 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a serious condition that may lead to 
severe disability or death.  </p>
<p>Although PML has not been observed with MAVENCLAD, as a precaution, you may have a head 
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) before you start treatment. </p>
<p>Cancer </p>
<p>Single events of cancer have been observed in patients who had received cladribine in clinical studies. 
Talk to your doctor if you have previously had cancer. Your doctor will decide the best treatment 
options for you. As a precautionary measure, you should follow standard cancer screening 
recommendations, as advised by your doctor. </p>
<p>Liver problems </p>
<p>MAVENCLAD may cause liver problems. Talk to your doctor before taking MAVENCLAD if you 
have or have ever had liver problems. Tell your doctor immediately if you develop one or more 
of the following symptoms: feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, stomach pain, tiredness (fatigue), loss of 
appetite, yellow skin or eyes (jaundice) or dark urine. These could be symptoms of serious liver 
problems. </p>
<p>Contraception </p>
<p>Men and women must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after the 
last dose. This is important because MAVENCLAD can seriously harm your baby. </p>
<p>See also 'Pregnancy and breast-feeding'. </p>
<p>Blood transfusions </p>
<p>If you require blood transfusions, tell the doctor that you are taking MAVENCLAD. You may have to 
have the blood irradiated to prevent complications. </p>
<p>Changing treatments </p>
<p>If you change from other MS treatments to MAVENCLAD, your doctor will check that your blood 
cell counts (lymphocytes) are normal before you start treatment. </p>
<p>If you change from MAVENCLAD to other MS treatments, talk to your doctor. There can be overlaps 
in the effect on your immune system. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Use of MAVENCLAD is not recommended in patients below the age of 18 years, because it has not 
been investigated in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and MAVENCLAD </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Do not start MAVENCLAD together with medicines that weaken your immune system or reduce the 
production of blood cells by your bone marrow. These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine (used to suppress the immune system, for 
example after organ transplantation); </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>methotrexate (used to treat conditions such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis); </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>long-term corticosteroids (used to reduce inflammation, for example in asthma). Short-term 
corticosteroids can be used when advised by your doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use MAVENCLAD together with other medicines for MS unless specifically advised by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Do not take MAVENCLAD at the same time as any other medicine. Leave a gap of at least 
3 hours between taking MAVENCLAD and other medicines taken by mouth. MAVENCLAD 
contains hydroxypropylbetadex that may interact with other medicines in your stomach. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, if you are or have been treated with: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>medicines which may affect your blood cells (for example carbamazepine, used to treat 
epilepsy). Your doctor may need to supervise you more closely. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>certain types of vaccines (live and live attenuated vaccines). If you have been vaccinated within 
the last 4 to 6 weeks, MAVENCLAD therapy must be delayed. You must not receive such 
vaccines during MAVENCLAD treatment. Your immune system must have recovered before 
you can be vaccinated, and blood tests will check this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dilazep, nifedipine, nimodipine, reserpine, cilostazol or sulindac (used to treat the heart, high 
blood pressure, vascular conditions or inflammation), or eltrombopag (used to treat conditions 
associated with bleeding). Your doctor will tell you what to do if you have to take these 
medicines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rifampicin (used to treat certain types of infection), St. John's wort (used to treat depression) or 
corticosteroids (used to suppress inflammation). Your doctor will tell you what to do if you 
have to take these medicines. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not take MAVENCLAD if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. This is important 
because MAVENCLAD may seriously harm your baby. </p>
<p>You must use effective methods of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during 
MAVENCLAD treatment and for 6 months after taking the last dose. If you get pregnant more than 
6 months after the last dose in year 1, no safety risk is expected but this will mean that you cannot 
receive treatment with MAVENCLAD while you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Men must use effective methods of contraception to prevent their partner from getting pregnant while 
being treated with MAVENCLAD and for 6 months after the last dose. </p>
<p>Your doctor will give you guidance on appropriate methods of contraception. </p>
<p>Do not take MAVENCLAD, if you are breast-feeding. If your doctor believes that MAVENCLAD is 
essential for you, your doctor will advise you to stop breast-feeding during treatment and at least one 
week after the last dose. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>MAVENCLAD is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>MAVENCLAD contains sorbitol </p>
<p>This medicine contains 64 mg sorbitol in each tablet. </p>         </div>"""

<p>You will be given MAVENCLAD as two treatment courses over 2 years. 
Each treatment course consists of 2 treatment weeks, which are one month apart at the beginning of 
each treatment year. 
A treatment week consists of 4 or 5 days on which you receive 1 or 2 tablets daily (see Table 1). </p>
<p>Example: if you start your treatment mid April, you take your tablets as shown. </p>

<p>Before you start a treatment course, your doctor will do a blood test to check that the levels of 
lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) are in an acceptable range. If this is not the case, your 
treatment will be delayed. </p>
<p>Once you have completed the 2 treatment courses over 2 years, your doctor will continue to monitor 
your health for another 2 years, in which you do not need to take the medicine. </p>
