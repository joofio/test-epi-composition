Mayzent contains the active substance siponimod. Siponimod belongs to a group of medicines called 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. </p>
<p>What Mayzent is used for 
Mayzent is used to treat adults with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active 
disease. Active disease in SPMS is when there are still relapses or when MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging) results show signs of inflammation. </p>
<p>How Mayzent works 
Mayzent helps to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from attacks by the body s own immune 
system. It does this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>making some white blood cells (called lymphocytes) less able to move freely within the body, 
and </li>
<li>stopping these cells from reaching the brain and spinal cord. 
This reduces nerve damage caused by SPMS and as a result Mayzent helps to slow down the effects of 
the disease activity (such as worsening disability, brain lesions and relapses). </li>

- if you are allergic to siponimod, peanut, soya or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if you have an immunodeficiency syndrome. 
- if you have ever had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. 
- if you have an active cancer. 
- if you have severe liver problems. 
- if, in the last 6 months, you have had a heart attack, unstable angina, stroke or certain types of

pacemaker. 
- if blood tests show that your body cannot break down this medicine well enough, you should 
not take it (see  Blood tests before and during treatment  below). 
- if you are pregnant or could become pregnant and are not using effective contraception. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Mayzent: 
* if you have an infection or if your immune system does not work properly (for example due to a 
disease or to medicines that suppress the immune system; see also  Other medicines and 
Mayzent ). 
* if you have never had chickenpox and have not been vaccinated against it. You may be at 
greater risk of complications if you develop chickenpox during Mayzent treatment. Your doctor 
may want to vaccinate you against chickenpox before you start treatment. 
* if you are planning to have any vaccinations. Your doctor will advise you on this (see  Other 
medicines and Mayzent ). 
* if you have ever had, or have, difficulties with your vision (in particular a condition called 
macular oedema) or an infection or inflammation of the eye (uveitis). Your doctor may want 
you to have eye examinations before you start treatment and regularly while you are on 
treatment. Mayzent can cause a swelling in the macula (the area of the eye that enables you to 
see shapes, colours and details) known as macular oedema. Your chance of developing macular 
oedema is higher if you have had it before or if you have ever had uveitis (an inflammation of 
the eye). 
* if you have diabetes. The chance of developing macular oedema (see above) is higher in patients 
with diabetes. 
* if you have ever had any of the following conditions (even if you are receiving treatment for 
them): severe heart disease, irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), stroke or other disease 
related to the blood vessels in the brain, a slow heart rate, fainting, disturbance of heart rhythm 
(indicated by abnormal ECG results). 
* if you have severe breathing problems when sleeping (sleep apnoea). 
* if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicines. Your blood pressure 
will need to be checked regularly. 
* if you have ever had liver problems. Your doctor may want to perform blood tests to check your 
liver function before prescribing Mayzent. 
* if you could become pregnant, because siponimod can harm the unborn baby when used during 
pregnancy. Before you start treatment, your doctor will explain the risk and ask you to do a 
pregnancy test to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective contraception during 
treatment and up to 10 days after stopping treatment (see  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
fertility ). 
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor before taking Mayzent. </p>
<p>Look out for the following while taking Mayzent 
If you get any of the following while taking Mayzent, tell your doctor immediately because it could 
be serious: 
* if you have an infection. Mayzent lowers the number of white cells in your blood. White blood 
cells fight infection, so you may get infections more easily while you are taking Mayzent (and 
up to 3 to 4 weeks after you stop taking it). These could be serious and possibly even 
life-threatening. 
* if you think your multiple sclerosis (MS) is getting worse or if you notice any new or unusual 
symptoms. A rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can 
cause symptoms similar to SPMS. It can occur in patients taking medicines like Mayzent and 
other medicines used for treating MS. 
*  if you have fever, feel like you have flu or have a headache together with a stiff neck, sensitivity 
to light, nausea or confusion. These may be symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis caused 
by a viral or fungal infection (such as cryptococcal meningitis). 
* if you have changes in your vision, for example if the centre of your vision becomes blurred or 
has shadows, a blind spot develops in the centre of your vision, or you have problems seeing 
colours or fine detail. These may be symptoms of macular oedema. You may not notice any 
symptoms in the early stages of macular oedema, and it can cause some of the same visual 
symptoms as an MS attack (optic neuritis). Your doctor may want you to have an eye 
examination 3 or 4 months after starting treatment and possibly again later. If macular oedema 
is confirmed, your doctor may advise you to stop Mayzent treatment. 
* if you have symptoms such as sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision 
changes. These may be symptoms of a condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES). 
* if you have symptoms such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, 
yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes or abnormally dark urine. These may be symptoms 
of liver problems. 
* if you notice any skin nodules (e.g. shiny, pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not 
heal within weeks. </p>
<p>Slow heart rate (bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat 
During the first days of treatment, Mayzent can cause the heart rate to slow down (bradycardia). You 
may not feel anything or you may feel dizzy or tired. It may also cause your heartbeat to become 
irregular at the beginning of treatment. If anything indicates that you may be at higher risk of suffering 
from these effects, your doctor may decide to monitor you more closely at the start of treatment, refer 
you first to a heart specialist (cardiologist), or choose not to give you Mayzent. </p>
<p>Tests before and during treatment 
How quickly this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in the body varies from patient to patient and 
different people therefore require different doses. Your doctor will perform a blood or saliva test 
before you start treatment to determine which dose is best for you. In rare cases, the test result may 
indicate that you should not take Mayzent. </p>
<ul>
<li>Blood count 
The desired effect of Mayzent treatment is to reduce the amount of white blood cells in your blood. 
This will usually go back to normal within 3-4 weeks of stopping treatment. If you need to have any 
blood tests, tell the doctor that you are taking Mayzent. Otherwise, it may not be possible for the 
doctor to understand the results of the test, and for certain types of blood test your doctor may need to 
take more blood than usual. </li>
</ul>
<p>Before you start Mayzent, your doctor will confirm whether you have enough white blood cells in 
your blood and may want to repeat a check regularly. In case you do not have enough white blood 
cells, your doctor may need to stop or reduce your Mayzent dose. </p>
<p>Before the start of treatment your blood will also be tested to check how well your liver is working. </p>
<p>Skin cancer 
Skin cancers have been reported in MS patients treated with Mayzent. Talk to your doctor straight 
away if you notice any skin nodules (e.g. shiny pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not heal 
within weeks. Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin tissue (e.g. 
unusual moles) with a change in colour, shape or size over time. Before you start Mayzent, a skin 
examination is required to check whether you have any skin nodules. Your doctor will also carry out 
regular skin examinations during your treatment with Mayzent. If you develop problems with your 
skin, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after consultation may decide that it is 
important for you to be seen on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Exposure to the sun and protection against the sun 
Mayzent weakens your immune system. This may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. You 
should limit your exposure to the sun and UV rays by: 
* wearing appropriate protective clothing. 
* regularly applying sunscreen with a high degree of UV protection. </p>
<p>Worsening of MS after stopping Mayzent treatment 
Do not stop taking Mayzent or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with 
Mayzent (see  If you stop taking Mayzent  in section 3). </p>
<p>Elderly patients (65 years of age and above) 
There is no experience with Mayzent in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because it has not yet 
been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Mayzent 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Make sure to tell your doctor if you are taking or receiving any of the following medicines 
or therapies: 
* medicines for an irregular heartbeat, such as amiodarone, procainamide, quinidine or sotalol. 
Your doctor may decide not to prescribe Mayzent because it could intensify the effect on 
irregular heartbeat. 
* medicines that slow down the heartbeat, such as diltiazem or verapamil (which belong to a 
group of medicines called calcium channel blockers), digoxin or ivabradine. Your doctor may 
refer you to a heart specialist, as your medicines may need to be changed because Mayzent may 
also slow down your heartbeat in the first days of treatment. If you are taking a beta blocker, 
such as atenolol or propranolol, your doctor may ask you to temporarily stop your beta-blocker 
treatment until you have reached your full daily dose of Mayzent. 
* medicines that affect the immune system, such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressants or other 
medicines to treat MS. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking these to avoid an increased 
effect on the immune system. 
* vaccines. If you need to have a vaccination, talk to your doctor first. During and for up to 
4 weeks after stopping treatment with Mayzent, you should not be given certain types of 
vaccine (called live attenuated vaccines) as they could trigger the infection that they were 
supposed to prevent (see section 2). 
* fluconazole and certain other medicines can increase the levels of Mayzent in the blood and are 
not recommended to be taken in combination with Mayzent. Your doctor will advise you on 
this. 
* carbamazepine and certain other medicines can lower the levels of Mayzent in your blood and 
can therefore stop it from working properly. Your doctor will advise you on this. 
* modafinil and certain other medicines can lower the levels of Mayzent in the blood of certain 
patients and can therefore stop it from working properly. Your doctor will advise you on this if 
this is relevant for you. 
* phototherapy with UV radiation or PUVA photochemotherapy. UV therapy during Mayzent 
treatment may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Do not use Mayzent during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman 
who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. If Mayzent is used during 
pregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. If you are a woman who could become 
pregnant, your doctor will inform you about this risk before you start treatment with Mayzent and will 
ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective 
contraception while taking Mayzent and for at least 10 days after you stop taking it to avoid becoming 
pregnant. Ask your doctor about reliable methods of contraception. </p>
<p>If you do become pregnant while taking Mayzent, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
decide to stop treatment (see  If you stop taking Mayzent  in section 3). Specialised pre-natal 
monitoring will be performed. </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed while you are taking Mayzent. Mayzent may pass into breast milk and 
there is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Mayzent is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines when you are on your regular 
treatment dose. At the start of treatment you may occasionally feel dizzy. On your first day of 
treatment with Mayzent, therefore, you should not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Mayzent contains lactose and soya lecithin 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

Starting treatment 
You will be given a titration pack, with which your dose will be gradually increased over 5 days. 
Follow the instructions on the pack (see also the  Titration pack  table). </p>
<p>The purpose of the titration phase is to reduce the risk of side effects on your heart at the start of

<p>On day 6, you will switch to your regular treatment dose. </p>
<p>On the first 6 days of treatment, it is recommended that you take the tablets in the morning with or 
without food. </p>
<p>Treatment dose 
The recommended dose is 2 mg once daily (one tablet of 2 mg Mayzent) with or without food. </p>
<p>Your doctor may instruct you to take only 1 mg once daily (one tablet of Mayzent 1 mg or four tablets 
of Mayzent 0.25 mg) if the blood test performed before the start of treatment showed that your body 
breaks down Mayzent slowly (see  Tests before and during treatment ). If this applies to you, note 
that it is nevertheless safe for you to take five 0.25 mg tablets on day 5 of the titration period as 
indicated above. </p>
<p>Mayzent is for oral use. Take the tablet with water. </p>
<p>If you take more Mayzent than you should 
If you have taken too many Mayzent tablets, or if you take your first tablet from the treatment dose 
pack instead of the titration pack by mistake, call your doctor straight away. Your doctor may decide 
to keep you under observation. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Mayzent 
During the first 6 days of treatment, if you have forgotten to take your dose on one day, call your 
doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor will need to prescribe a new titration pack. You will 
have to restart at day 1. If you miss a dose when you are on the regular treatment dose (day 7 onwards), take it as soon as you 
remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue as usual. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget to take Mayzent for 4 or more days in 
a row, call your doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor will need to prescribe a new 
titration pack and you will have to restart treatment at day 1. If you stop taking Mayzent 
Do not stop taking Mayzent or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Mayzent will stay in your body for up to 10 days after you stop taking it. Your white blood cell 
(lymphocyte) count may remain low for up to 3 to 4 weeks after you stop taking Mayzent. The side 
effects described in this leaflet may still occur during this period (see  Possible side effects  in 
section 4). </p>
<p>If you have to restart Mayzent more than 4 days after you stopped taking it, your doctor will prescribe 
a new titration pack and you will have to restart treatment at day 1 again. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with 
Mayzent. </p>
