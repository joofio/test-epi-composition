melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. </p>
<p>Mekinist in combination with dabrafenib is also used to prevent melanoma from coming back after it 
has been removed by surgery. </p>
<p>Mekinist in combination with dabrafenib is also used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </p>
<p>Both cancers have a particular change (mutation) in a gene called BRAF at the V600 position. This 
mutation in the gene may have caused the cancer to develop. Your medicine targets proteins made 
from this mutated gene and slows down or stops the development of your cancer. </p>         </div>"""

skin cancers. </p>
<p>Your doctor will also check your head, neck, mouth and lymph glands and you will have scans of your 
chest and stomach area (called CT scans) regularly. You may also have blood tests. These checks are 
to detect if any other cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, develops inside your body. Pelvic 
examinations (for women) and anal examinations are also recommended before and at the end of your 
treatment. </p>

<p>Immune system disorders 
If you experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph glands, bruising or skin rash, at the
