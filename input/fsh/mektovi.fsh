melanoma when it has

* spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. </p>
<p>Mutations in the BRAF gene can produce proteins that cause the melanoma to grow. Mektovi targets 
another protein called  MEK  that stimulates cancer cell growth. When Mektovi is used in 
combination with encorafenib (which targets the changed  BRAF  protein), the combination slows

<p>Do not take Mektovi<br />
-  if you are allergic to binimetinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Mektovi about all of your medical conditions, 
particularly if you have any of the following: <br />
<em> heart problems 
* bleeding problems or if you are taking medicines that may cause bleeding<br />
</em> eye problems including glaucoma or increased pressure in your eyes 
* muscle problems 
* high blood pressure 
* blood clots 
* lung or breathing problems 
* liver problems  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had blockage in the vein carrying blood away from the eye (retinal 
vein occlusion), as Mektovi is not recommended in such cases. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma, as binimetinib when taken 
with encorafenib may worsen certain other types of cancers. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get the following while you are taking this 
medicine: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heart problems: Mektovi can make your heart work less well, or make existing heart problems 
worse. Your doctor will check that your heart is working properly before and during your 
treatment with this medicine. Talk to your doctor immediately if you have any symptoms of 
heart problems such as feeling dizzy, tired, lightheaded, if you have shortness of breath, if you 
feel like your heart is pounding, racing, beating irregularly or if you have swelling in the legs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bleeding problems: Mektovi may cause serious bleeding problems. Talk to your doctor 
immediately if you have any symptoms of bleeding problems such as coughing up of blood, 
blood clots, vomit containing blood or that looks like  coffee grounds , red or black stools 
that look like tar, passing blood in the urine, stomach (abdominal) pain, unusual vaginal 
bleeding. Also tell your doctor if you have headache, dizziness or weakness.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eye problems: Mektovi can cause serious eye problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if 
you get blurred vision, loss of vision or other vision changes (such as coloured dots in your 
vision), halo (seeing blurred outline around objects). Your doctor will examine your eyes for 
any problems with your sight while you are taking Mektovi.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle problems: Mektovi can cause breakdown of muscle (rhabdomyolysis). Your doctor 
will run blood tests to check for muscle problems before and during treatment. As a 
precaution, drink plenty of fluids during treatment. Talk to your doctor immediately if you get 
muscle pain, cramps, stiffness, spasm, dark urine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High blood pressure: Mektovi can raise blood pressure. Your doctor or nurse will check your 
blood pressure before and during treatment with Mektovi. Talk to your doctor immediately if 
you get severe headache, feel dizzy, lightheaded or if your blood pressure measured on a home 
blood pressure device is much higher than usual. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood clots: Mektovi can cause blood clots in your arms or legs, and if a clot travels to your 
lungs it could lead to death. Talk to your doctor immediately if you get chest pain, sudden 
shortness of breath, trouble breathing, pain in your legs with or without swelling, swelling in 
your arms and legs, or a cool, pale arm or leg. If necessary, your doctor may interrupt your 
treatment or stop it altogether. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lung or breathing problems: This medicine may cause lung or breathing problems including 
inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease); signs and symptoms can 
include: cough, shortness of breath or fatigue. If necessary, your doctor may interrupt your 
treatment or stop it altogether.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin changes: Mektovi, when taken with encorafenib, may cause other types of skin cancer 
such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Your doctor will check your skin before initiation 
of treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months after you stop taking 
these medicines to look for any new skin cancer. Tell your doctor immediately if you detect 
any skin changes during and after the treatment including: new wart, skin sore or reddish 
bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in size or colour of a mole. 
Additionally, your doctor needs to check for squamous cell carcinoma on your head, neck, 
mouth and lymph glands, and you will have CT scans regularly. This is a precaution in case a 
squamous cell carcinoma develops inside your body. Genital examinations (for women) and 
anal examinations are also recommended before the initiation and at the end of your treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver problems: Mektovi can cause abnormal blood tests related to your liver (raised levels of 
liver enzymes). Your doctor will run blood tests to check your liver before and during 
treatment.  </p>
