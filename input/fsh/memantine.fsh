Memantine ratiopharm contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. It belongs to a group 
of medicines known as anti-dementia medicines. 
Memory loss in Alzheimer s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve 
signals important in learning and memory. Memantine ratiopharm belongs to a group of medicines 
called NMDA-receptor antagonists. Memantine ratiopharm acts on these NMDA-receptors improving 
the transmission of nerve signals and the memory. </p>
<p>What is Memantine ratiopharm used for 
Memantine ratiopharm is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer s 
disease. </p>         </div>"""
