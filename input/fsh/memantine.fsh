Memory loss in Alzheimer s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve 
signals important in learning and memory. Memantine Mylan belongs to a group of medicines called 
NMDA-receptor antagonists. Memantine Mylan acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the 
transmission of nerve signals and the memory. </p>
