adolescents and adults at risk of exposure to a bacterium named Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, 
C, W-135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. The vaccine works by causing your body to make its 
own protection (antibodies) against these bacteria. </p>
<p>Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious and sometimes 
life-threatening infections such as meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). </p>
<p>Menveo cannot cause bacterial meningitis. This vaccine contains a protein (called CRM197) from 
the bacteria that cause diphtheria. Menveo does not protect against diphtheria. This means that 
you (or your child) should receive other vaccines to protect against diphtheria when these are due 
or when advised by your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>ever had an allergic reaction to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this 
vaccine (listed in section 6) </li>
<li>ever had an allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid (a substance used in a number of other 
vaccines) </li>
<li>an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example 
cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions: </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given Menveo if you or your child:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a weakened immune system. Little is known about the effectiveness of Menveo when 
administered to individuals with weakened immunity due to the use of immunosuppressive 
medications, or HIV infection, and other possible causes. It is possible that the effectiveness 
of Menveo could be reduced in such individuals. </li>
<li>have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from clotting properly, such as 
persons receiving blood thinners (anticoagulants). </li>
<li>receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as complement activation, 
such as eculizumab. Even if you have been vaccinated with Menveo you remain at increased risk of 
disease caused by the Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. </p>
<p>This vaccine can only protect against meningococcal group A, C, W-135, and Y bacteria. It cannot 
protect against other types of meningococcal bacteria other than groups A, C, W-135 and Y, or against 
other causes of meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). </p>
<p>As with any vaccine, Menveo may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine. </p>
<p>If you or your child received a dose of Menveo more than one year ago and remains at particular 
risk of exposure to meningococcal group A bacteria, consideration may be given to administering 
a booster dose to maintain protection. Your doctor will advise you if and when you should receive 
a booster dose. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Menveo </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Menveo may be given at the same time as other vaccinations but any other injected vaccines should 
preferably be given into a different arm from the site of the Menveo injection. </p>
<p>These include the following vaccines: tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap), 
human papillomavirus (HPV), yellow fever, typhoid fever (Vi polysaccharide), Japanese encephalitis, 
rabies, hepatitis A and B and meningococcal group B (Bexsero). </p>
<p>Menveo s effect could be diminished when administered to individuals who are taking medicines that 
suppress the immune system. </p>
<p>Separate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is being administered at the same time. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before this medicine is given. Your doctor or nurse may still recommend that 
you receive Menveo if you are at high risk of infection with meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y 
bacteria. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
Dizziness has been very rarely reported following vaccination. This may temporarily affect the ability 
to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Menveo contains </p>
<p>This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
 sodium-free . 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially
