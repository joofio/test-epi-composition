<p>MEPACT is used to treat osteosarcoma (bone cancer) in children, adolescents and young adults 
(between 2 and 30 years). It is used after you have had surgery to remove the tumour and together 
with chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer coming back. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to mifamurtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you are taking medicines containing ciclosporin or other calcineurin inhibitors or high 
doses of non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (see  Using other medicines<br />
below). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using MEPACT:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have had problems with your heart or blood vessels, like blood clots 
(thrombosis), bleeding (haemorrhage) or inflammation of the veins (vasculitis). You 
should be more closely monitored while receiving MEPACT treatment. If you have 
long-lasting or worsening symptoms, you should contact your doctor, as MEPACT 
treatment may need to be delayed or discontinued. </li>
<li>if you have a history of asthma or other breathing disorders. Before using MEPACT, you 
should discuss with your doctor whether you should take medicine for your asthma when 
using MEPACT. </li>
<li>if you have a history of inflammatory or autoimmune disease or have been treated with 
corticosteroids or other medicines that may affect your immune system. </li>
<li>if you have any allergic reactions to any medicines such as rash, breathlessness and high 
blood pressure. If you have worsening symptoms, you should contact your doctor, as these 
may have been caused by MEPACT.  </li>
<li>if you have stomach problems such as nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite. If your 
problems increase, you should contact your doctor, as these may have been caused by 
MEPACT when used with chemotherapy.  </li>
<li>if you develop chills or shivering, or feel warm. You should take your temperature as you 
may have a fever. A fever with a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) may be a sign 
of serious infection.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed information on warnings and precautions relating to side effects that could occur while you 
are taking the medicine is presented in section 4. Children<br />
It is not recommended to give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years because 
information on how safe and how well this medicine works is not available for this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and MEPACT 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines that may be obtained without a prescription. It is especially important to tell 
your doctor if you are taking medicines containing any of the following active substances:</p>
<ul>
<li>ciclosporin, tacrolimus, used after a transplant to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, or 
other immunosuppressants used e.g. to treat psoriasis (a skin disease). </li>
<li>Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, or 
diclofenac, used for treatment of headaches, fever or pain. You must not use MEPACT with 
high doses of NSAIDs. </li>
<li>corticosteroids, used to treat inflammations, allergies or asthma. Regular use of 
corticosteroids should be avoided when using MEPACT as this may affect the way the 
medicine works. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to separate the times of administration of MEPACT and doxorubicin or other 
medicines if used in the same chemotherapy treatment regimen. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
MEPACT has not been tested in pregnant women. Therefore, MEPACT should not be used during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.<br />
You should use effective contraception if you are being treated with MEPACT.  </p>
<p>It is not known whether MEPACT passes to human milk. If you are breast-feeding, you should 
discuss with your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some very common and common side effects of MEPACT treatment (such as dizziness, vertigo, 
fatigue and blurred vision) may affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>MEPACT contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

MEPACT will be administered only under the supervision of a specialist physician.<br />
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are 
not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose of MEPACT is 2 mg mifamurtide/m2 body surface area. It will be given to 
you twice a week (at least three days apart) for the first 12 weeks, then once a week for 24 more 
weeks.  </p>
<p>The schedule of your MEPACT treatments can be adjusted to fit with your chemotherapy 
schedule. It is not necessary to interrupt your schedule of MEPACT if your chemotherapy is 
delayed; you should complete 36 weeks (9 months) of treatment with MEPACT without an 
interruption. </p>
<p>How MEPACT is given 
The freeze-dried powder has to be reconstituted into a liquid suspension, filtered using the filter 
provided and further diluted before use. MEPACT is then infused directly into your vein 
(intravenous) over about 1 hour. This is done by your doctor or a nurse, who will also monitor you 
during that time. You do not need to be hospitalised to receive MEPACT. It can also be 
administered as an outpatient. </p>
<p>If you use more MEPACT than you should 
You may experience more severe side effects, including fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
headache and high blood pressure or low blood pressure. In the event of such an overdose, contact 
your doctor or nearest hospital. </p>
<p>If you stop using MEPACT 
You should not stop treatment with MEPACT before finishing the course of treatment without 
discussing with your doctor first. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Instructions for preparation of MEPACT for intravenous infusion </p>
<p>Materials provided in each package - * 1 vial of MEPACT (mifamurtide) 
* 1 Filter for MEPACT </p>
<p>Materials required but not provided - * Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, 100 mL bag<br />
* 1 single use 60 or 100 mL sterile syringe with luer lock 
* 2 medium (18) gauge sterile injection needles </p>
<p>It is recommended that the reconstitution of the liposomal suspension should be performed in a 
laminar flow cabinet utilising sterile gloves using aseptic technique. </p>
<p>The lyophilised powder should be allowed to reach a temperature between approximately 
20  C-25  C prior to reconstitution, filtering using the filter provided and dilution. This should 
take approximately 30 minutes.  </p>
<ol>
<li>The cap of the vial should be removed and the stopper cleaned using an alcohol pad. </li>
<li>The filter should be removed from the blister pack, and the cap removed from the filter 
spike.<br />
The spike should then be inserted into the vial septum firmly until seated. The filter luer 
connector cap should not be removed at this time. </li>
<li>The 100 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection bag, needle and syringe 
should be unpacked (not provided in the pack). </li>
<li>The site of the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection bag where the needle 
is going to be inserted should be swabbed with an alcohol pad. </li>
<li>Using the needle and syringe, 50 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection should be withdrawn from the bag. </li>
<li>After removing the needle from the syringe, the syringe should be attached to the filter by 
opening the filter luer connector cap (figure 1). </li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 1 </p>
<ol>
<li>The sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is added to the vial by slow, 
firm depression of the syringe plunger. The filter and syringe must not be removed from 
the vial. </li>
<li>The vial should be allowed to stand undisturbed for 1 minute to ensure thorough hydration 
of the dry substance. </li>
<li>The vial should then be shaken vigorously for 1 minute while keeping the filter and 
syringe attached. During this time the liposomes are formed spontaneously (figure 2). </li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 2 </p>
<ol>
<li>The desired dose may be withdrawn from the vial by inverting the vial and slowly pulling 
back on the syringe plunger (figure 3). Each mL reconstituted suspension contains 0.08 mg 
mifamurtide. The volume of suspension to be withdrawn for dose quantities is calculated as 
follows: </li>
</ol>
<p>Volume to withdraw = [12.5 x calculated dose (mg)] mL </p>
<p>For convenience, the following table of concordance is provided: </p>
<p>Dose 
Volume 
1.0 mg 
12.5 mL 
2.0 mg 
25 mL 
3.0 mg 
37.5 mL 
4.0 mg 
50 mL 
Figure 3 </p>
<ol>
<li>The syringe should then be removed from the filter and a new needle placed on the 
suspension-filled syringe. The bag injection site should be wiped with an alcohol pad and 
the suspension in the syringe should be injected into the original bag containing the 
remaining 50 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (figure 4). </li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 4 </p>
<ol>
<li>The bag should be gently swirled to mix the solution. </li>
<li>Patient identification, time and date should be added to the label on the bag containing the 
reconstituted, filtered and diluted liposomal suspension.  </li>
<li>Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 6 hours at room 
temperature (between approximately 20  C-25  C). </li>
<li>From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the 
user and would normally not be longer than 6 hours at room temperature. </li>
</ol>
<p>No special requirements for disposal. </p>         </div>"""
