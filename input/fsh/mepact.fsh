<p>MEPACT is used to treat osteosarcoma (bone cancer) in children, adolescents and young adults 
(between 2 and 30 years). It is used after you have had surgery to remove the tumour and together

<li>if you are allergic to mifamurtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you are taking medicines containing ciclosporin or other calcineurin inhibitors or high 
doses of non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (see  Using other medicines<br />
below). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using MEPACT:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have had problems with your heart or blood vessels, like blood clots 
(thrombosis), bleeding (haemorrhage) or inflammation of the veins (vasculitis). You 
should be more closely monitored while receiving MEPACT treatment. If you have 
long-lasting or worsening symptoms, you should contact your doctor, as MEPACT 
treatment may need to be delayed or discontinued. </li>
<li>if you have a history of asthma or other breathing disorders. Before using MEPACT, you 
should discuss with your doctor whether you should take medicine for your asthma when 
using MEPACT. </li>
<li>if you have a history of inflammatory or autoimmune disease or have been treated with 
corticosteroids or other medicines that may affect your immune system. </li>
<li>if you have any allergic reactions to any medicines such as rash, breathlessness and high 
blood pressure. If you have worsening symptoms, you should contact your doctor, as these 
may have been caused by MEPACT.  </li>
<li>if you have stomach problems such as nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite. If your 
problems increase, you should contact your doctor, as these may have been caused by 
MEPACT when used with chemotherapy.  </li>
<li>if you develop chills or shivering, or feel warm. You should take your temperature as you 
may have a fever. A fever with a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) may be a sign 
of serious infection.  </li>

<p>Other medicines and MEPACT 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines that may be obtained without a prescription. It is especially important to tell 
your doctor if you are taking medicines containing any of the following active substances:</p>
<ul>
<li>ciclosporin, tacrolimus, used after a transplant to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, or 
other immunosuppressants used e.g. to treat psoriasis (a skin disease). </li>
<li>Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, or 
diclofenac, used for treatment of headaches, fever or pain. You must not use MEPACT with 
high doses of NSAIDs. </li>
<li>corticosteroids, used to treat inflammations, allergies or asthma. Regular use of 
corticosteroids should be avoided when using MEPACT as this may affect the way the 
medicine works. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to separate the times of administration of MEPACT and doxorubicin or other 
medicines if used in the same chemotherapy treatment regimen. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
MEPACT has not been tested in pregnant women. Therefore, MEPACT should not be used during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.<br />
You should use effective contraception if you are being treated with MEPACT.  </p>
<p>It is not known whether MEPACT passes to human milk. If you are breast-feeding, you should 
discuss with your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some very common and common side effects of MEPACT treatment (such as dizziness, vertigo, 
fatigue and blurred vision) may affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>MEPACT contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

MEPACT will be administered only under the supervision of a specialist physician.<br />
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are 
not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose of MEPACT is 2 mg mifamurtide/m2 body surface area. It will be given to 
you twice a week (at least three days apart) for the first 12 weeks, then once a week for 24 more 
weeks.  </p>
<p>The schedule of your MEPACT treatments can be adjusted to fit with your chemotherapy 
schedule. It is not necessary to interrupt your schedule of MEPACT if your chemotherapy is 
delayed; you should complete 36 weeks (9 months) of treatment with MEPACT without an 
interruption. </p>
<p>How MEPACT is given 
The freeze-dried powder has to be reconstituted into a liquid suspension, filtered using the filter 
provided and further diluted before use. MEPACT is then infused directly into your vein 
(intravenous) over about 1 hour. This is done by your doctor or a nurse, who will also monitor you 
during that time. You do not need to be hospitalised to receive MEPACT. It can also be 
administered as an outpatient. </p>
<p>If you use more MEPACT than you should 
You may experience more severe side effects, including fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
headache and high blood pressure or low blood pressure. In the event of such an overdose, contact 
your doctor or nearest hospital. </p>
<p>If you stop using MEPACT 
You should not stop treatment with MEPACT before finishing the course of treatment without 
discussing with your doctor first. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask
