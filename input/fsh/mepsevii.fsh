Mepsevii contains an enzyme called vestronidase alfa. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
enzyme replacement therapies. It is used in adults and children of all ages with MPS VII to treat non-
neurological manifestations of the disease (mucopolysaccharidosis VII, also known as Sly Syndrome).  </p>
<p>What is MPS VII 
MPS VII is an illness that runs in families, where the body does not produce enough of an enzyme 
called beta glucuronidase. 
- This enzyme helps to break down sugars in the body called mucopolysaccharides. 
- Mucopolysaccharides are made in the body and they help build bones, cartilage, skin, and 
tendons. 
- These sugars are re-cycled all the time   new ones are made and old ones are broken down.<br />
- Without enough beta glucuronidase, parts of these sugars build up in cells, leading to damage 
in the body. </p>
<p>How Mepsevii works<br />
This medicine replaces beta-glucuronidase   this helps to break down the sugars that collect in the 
tissues of people with MPS VII.<br />
- Treatment may improve various signs and symptoms of illness, like walking difficulties and 
tiredness. </p>
<p>Starting treatment early in children may stop the illness getting worse and reduce permanent damage. </p>         </div>"""

- If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to vestronidase alfa or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before you are given Mepsevii. 
The effects of treatment with vestronidase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered in cases where clear benefits (including stabilisation of disease 
manifestations) are not observed. Discontinuation of treatment may cause significant worsening of 
clinical status. </p>
<p>It should be considered that the administration of vestronidase alfa does not affect the irreversible 
complications (e.g. skeletal deformities). 
Look out for side effects during or shortly after Mepsevii infusion 
- You may have side effects while you are being given Mepsevii or for up to a day afterwards. 
These side effects are called infusion reactions because they are caused by the infusion (drip) of 
the medicine. They may include an allergic reaction (see section 4). If you have an infusion 
reaction, tell your doctor straight away. 
- If you have an allergic reaction during your infusion your doctor may slow down, or stop your 
infusion. Your doctor may also give (or have given) you other medicines to manage the allergic 
reaction such as an antihistamine or corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever.<br />
Other symptoms to look out for 
- If you have neck or back pain, feel numb in your arms or legs, or experience lack of control 
over passing water (urine) or stools, tell your doctor straight away. These problems can be 
signs of the illness and may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Mepsevii 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>You will not be given Mepsevii if you are pregnant unless treatment is clearly necessary. Discuss with 
your doctor if the benefits of using Mepsevii are greater than the possible risks to your unborn baby. 
This is because there is no experience on the use of Mepsevii during pregnancy. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Mepsevii passes into breast milk, but transfer of the medication to your baby 
is not expected. Discuss with your doctor if the benefits of using Mepsevii are greater than the 
potential risk to your baby while breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Mepsevii is not likely to affect you being able to drive or use machines.  </p>
<p>Mepsevii contains sodium 
This medicine contains 17.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5-mL vial, 
and is administered with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL as a diluent. Each vial dosed is therefore 
equivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Take 
this into account if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""
