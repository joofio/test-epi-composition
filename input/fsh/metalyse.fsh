Metalyse belongs to a group of medicines called thrombolytic agents. These medicines help to 
dissolve blood clots. Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator.
Metalyse is used to treat myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) within 6 hours after the onset of 
symptoms and helps to dissolve the blood clots that have formed in the blood vessels of the heart. This 
helps to prevent the damage caused by heart attacks and has been shown to save lives. </p>         </div>"""
