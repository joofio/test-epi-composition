  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What MINJUVI is 
MINJUVI contains the active substance tafasitamab. This is a type of protein called a monoclonal 
antibody designed to kill cancer cells. This protein acts by attaching to a specific target on the surface 
of a type of white blood cell called B cells or B lymphocytes. When tafasitamab sticks to the surface 
of these cells, the cells die. </p>
<p>What MINJUVI is used for 
MINJUVI is used to treat adults with a cancer of B cells called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. It is 
used when the cancer has come back after, or not responded to, previous treatment, if patients cannot 
be treated with a stem cell transplant instead. </p>
<p>What other medicines MINJUVI is given with 
MINJUVI is used with another cancer medicine lenalidomide at the start of treatment, after which 
MINJUVI treatment is continued on its own. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using MINJUVI if you have an infection or a history of 
recurring infections. </p>
<p>You might notice the following during treatment with MINJUVI: 
* Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions may occur most frequently during the first infusion. Your doctor will 
monitor you for infusion-related reactions during your infusion of MINJUVI. Inform your 
doctor immediately if you have reactions such as fever, chills, flushing, rash or breathing 
difficulties within 24 hours of infusion. 
Your doctor will give you treatment before each infusion to reduce the risk of infusion-related 
reactions. If you do not have reactions, your doctor may decide that you do not need these 
medicines with later infusions. 
* Reduced number of blood cells 
Treatment with MINJUVI can severely reduce the number of some types of blood cells in your 
body, such as white blood cells called neutrophils, platelets and red blood cells. Tell your doctor 
immediately if you have fever of 38  C or above, or any signs of bruising or bleeding, as these 
may be signs of such a reduction. 
Your doctor will check your blood cell counts throughout treatment and before starting each 
treatment cycle.<br />
* Infections 
Serious infections, including infections that can cause death, can occur during and following 
MINJUVI treatment. Tell your doctor if you notice signs of an infection, such as fever of 38  C 
or above, chills, cough or pain on urination. 
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
PML is a very rare and life threatening infection in the brain. Tell your doctor straight away if 
you have symptoms such as memory loss, trouble speaking, difficulty walking, or problems 
with your eyesight or numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg.<br />
If you had any of these symptoms before or during treatment with MINJUVI, or you notice any 
changes, tell your doctor straight away as these may be signs of PML. 
* Tumour lysis syndrome<br />
Some people may develop unusually high levels of some substances (such as potassium and uric 
acid) in the blood caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This is called 
tumour lysis syndrome. Tell your doctor if you have symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, lack 
of appetite or fatigue, dark urine, decreased urine or side or back pain, muscle cramps, 
numbness, or heart palpitations. Your doctor may give you treatment before each infusion to 
reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome and perform blood tests to check you for tumour lysis 
syndrome. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of these problems. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>MINJUVI is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years, as there is no information 
about the use in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and MINJUVI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>The use of live vaccines during treatment with tafasitamab is not recommended. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contraception<br />
Use of effective contraception during treatment with MINJUVI and for at least 3 months after 
end of treatment is recommended for women of childbearing potential.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not use MINJUVI during pregnancy and if you are of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. Pregnancy must be ruled out before treatment. Tell your doctor immediately if 
you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant during treatment with MINJUVI. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MINJUVI is given with lenalidomide for up to 12 cycles. Lenalidomide can harm the unborn 
baby and must not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential, 
unless all of the conditions of the lenalidomide pregnancy prevention programme are met. Your 
doctor will provide you with more information and recommendations. </p>
<ul>
<li>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with MINJUVI until at least 3 months after the last dose. It 
is not known whether tafasitamab passes into breast milk. </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>MINJUVI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, fatigue 
has been reported in patients taking tafasitamab and this should be taken into account when driving or 
using machines. </p>
<p>MINJUVI contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 37.0 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose of 5 vials 
(the dose of a patient weighing 83 kg). This is equivalent to 1.85% of the recommended maximum 
daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

one of your veins via infusion (drip). During and after the infusion, you will be checked regularly for 
infusion-related side effects. 
MINJUVI will be given to you in cycles of 28 days. The dose you get is based on your weight and will 
be worked out by your doctor.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 12 mg tafasitamab per kilogram body weight. This is given as an infusion 
into a vein according to the following schedule: 
* Cycle 1: infusion on day 1, 4, 8, 15 and 22 of the cycle 
* Cycles 2 and 3: infusion on day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle

<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>MINJUVI is provided in sterile, preservative-free single-use vials.<br />
MINJUVI should be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous infusion. 
Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and dilution. </p>
<p>Instructions for reconstitution 
* Determine the dose of tafasitamab based on patient weight by multiplying 12 mg by the patient 
weight (kg). Then calculate the number of tafasitamab vials needed (each vial contains 200 mg 
tafasitamab).<br />
* Using a sterile syringe, gently add 5.0 mL sterile water for injections into each MINJUVI vial. 
Direct the stream toward the walls of each vial and not directly on the lyophilised powder. 
* Gently swirl the reconstituted vial(s) to aid the dissolution of the lyophilised powder. Do not 
shake or swirl vigorously. Do not remove the contents until all of the solids have been 
completely dissolved. The lyophilised powder should dissolve within 5 minutes. 
* The reconstituted solution should appear as a colourless to slightly yellow solution. Before 
proceeding, ensure there is no particulate matter or discolouration by inspecting visually. If the 
solution is cloudy, discoloured or contains visible particles, discard the vial(s).  </p>
<p>Instructions for dilution 
* An infusion bag containing 250 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection 
should be used. 
* Calculate the total volume of the 40 mg/mL reconstituted tafasitamab solution needed. 
Withdraw a volume equal to this from the infusion bag and discard the withdrawn volume. 
* Withdraw the total calculated volume (mL) of reconstituted tafasitamab solution from the vial(s) 
and slowly add to the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) infusion bag. Discard any unused 
portion of tafasitamab remaining in the vial. 
* The final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 2 mg/mL to 8 mg/mL of 
tafasitamab.<br />
* Gently mix the intravenous bag by slowly inverting the bag. Do not shake. </p>
<p>Method of administration<br />
<em> For the first infusion of cycle 1, the intravenous infusion rate should be 70 mL/h for the first 
30 minutes. Afterwards, increase the rate to complete the first infusion within a 2.5-hour period.<br />
</em> All subsequent infusions should be administered within a 1.5 to 2-hour period. 
* Do not co-administer other medicines through the same infusion line. 
* Do not administer MINJUVI as an intravenous push or bolus. </p>
<p>Reconstituted solution (prior to dilution) 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours at 2  C   25  C. </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the risk of 
microbial contamination, the reconstituted solution should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. </p>
<p>Diluted solution (for infusion) 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for a maximum of 36 hours at 2  C <br />
8  C followed by up to 24 hours at up to 25  C. </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8  C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled 
and validated aseptic conditions. </p>
<p>Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. </p>         </div>"""
