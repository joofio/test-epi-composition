It is applied to the skin of the face to treat redness due to rosacea in adult patients.
Redness of the face due to rosacea is caused by high levels of blood flow in the facial skin, which is 
the result of enlargement (dilation) of the small blood vessels of the skin.
When applied, Mirvaso acts to narrow these blood vessels again which reduces the excess blood flow 
and redness.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to brimonidine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
-
in children below 2 years of age, as they may be at greater risk of side effects from any of the 
medicine absorbed through the skin.
-
if you are taking certain medicines used for depression or Parkinson s disease including 
so-called monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (for example selegiline or moclobemide)
or tricyclic antidepressants (such as imipramine) or tetracyclic antidepressants (such as 
maprotiline, mianserin or mirtazapin). Use of Mirvaso when taking these medicines may result 
in a fall in blood pressure.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist, before using Mirvaso especially if:
-
the skin of your face is irritated or has open wounds.
-
you have problems with your heart or your blood circulation.
-
you have depression, decreased blood flow to the brain or the heart, fall in blood pressure on 
standing up, decreased blood flow to the hands, feet or skin, or Sj gren s syndrome (a chronic 
disease in which the body s natural defence - the immune system - attacks the 
moisture-producing glands).
-
you have kidney or liver problems or have had them in the past.
-
you have had, or plan to have any laser procedure on the skin of your face.
It is important to start treatment with a small amount of gel, increase the dose gradually but do not 
exceed the maximum dose of 1 gram (approximately 5 pea sized amounts). See also instructions  How 
to use Mirvaso .
Do not apply Mirvaso more than once a day and do not exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram
(approximately 5 pea sized amounts). See also instructions  How to use Mirvaso .
Worsening of skin redness, flushing or burning feeling of the skin
Up to 1 in 6 patients experience the return of their redness worse than it was initially. Such worsening 
of redness usually develops within the first 2 weeks of treatment with Mirvaso. Generally, it resolves 
spontaneously after treatment is stopped. The effect should gradually disappear within a few days in 
most cases. Before you restart the treatment with Mirvaso, test it on a small area of the face on a day 
when you can stay at home. If you do not experience worsening of redness or burning, continue with 
the usual treatment (see section 3).
In case of worsening or unexpected redness, discontinue the treatment and contact your doctor.
If any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor since this medicine may not be suitable for you.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and 
efficacy has not been established for this age group. This is particularly important in children under 
the age of 2 years (see  Do not use Mirvaso ).
Other medicines and Mirvaso
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, because these medicines could affect your treatment with Mirvaso or Mirvaso could affect 
your treatment with these medicines.
Do not take Mirvaso with selegiline, moclobemide, imipramine, mianserin, or maprotiline, which are 
medicines that can be used for depression or Parkinson s disease, as this could lead to a change in the 
effectiveness of Mirvaso or could increase the chances for side effects such as a fall in blood pressure 
(see under  Do not use Mirvaso ).
Also, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:
-
medicines used for the treatment of pain, sleep disorders, or anxiety disorders
-
medicines used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine) or used for 
hyperactivity (methylphenidate) or used for high blood pressure (reserpine).
-
medicines which act on the same body mechanism as Mirvaso (other alpha agonists, e.g. 
clonidine; so-called alpha blockers or alpha antagonists, e.g. prazosin, isoprenaline which are 
most often used for treatment of high blood pressure, slow heart rate or asthma).
-
cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin), used to treat heart problems.
-
blood pressure lowering medicine such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (e.g. 
propranolol, amlodipine).
If any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure, talk to your doctor.
Mirvaso with alcohol
Tell your doctor if you consume alcohol regularly as this could affect your treatment with this 
medicine.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
The use of Mirvaso is not recommended during pregnancy. This is because its effects on your unborn 
baby are unknown. You should not use this medicine during breast-feeding, as it is unknown whether 
this medicine passes into the breast milk.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Mirvaso has no significant influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Mirvaso contains Methylparahydroxybenzoate (E218) which may cause allergic reactions 
(possibly delayed). This medicine also contains 55 mg propylene glycol (E1520) in each gram 
which is equivalent to 5.5% w/w, it may cause skin irritation.</p>         </div>"""

you are not sure.
Important: Mirvaso is intended for adults and only for use on the skin of the face. Do not use this 
medicine on other parts of your body, especially moist body surfaces, e.g. your eyes, mouth, nose or 
vagina.
Do not swallow.
Keep Mirvaso gel away from children.
How to use Mirvaso
Mirvaso is recommended to be applied to the face once a day only.
During the first week, start the treatment with a small amount of gel (a pea-sized amount) as explained 
by your doctor or nurse. 
If your symptoms remain the same or improve only slightly, you may then gradually increase the 
amount of gel. Spread it smoothly and evenly as a very thin layer as directed by your doctor or nurse. 
It is important not to exceed the maximum daily dose of 1gram (5 pea sized amounts applied to the 
whole face).
You should wash your hands immediately after applying this medicine.
If your symptoms worsen during treatment with Mirvaso (increased redness, or burning), stop 
treatment and make an appointment to see your doctor   see also section 2 under `Warnings and 
precautions .
You must avoid the eyes, eyelids, lips, mouth, and the inside of the nose. Should any gel get onto these 
areas, wash them immediately with plenty of water. If you experience worsening of redness or burning 
you should stop using Mirvaso and contact your doctor if needed.
Do not apply any other skin medicines or cosmetics immediately before the daily application of 
Mirvaso. You should use these products only after the applied Mirvaso has dried.
Pay attention when opening the tube / pump for the first time, not to spill a larger quantity of gel than 
what is needed. If this occurs, you should discard the excess gel so as not to apply more than the 
recommended dose. See paragraph  How to use Mirvaso  above.
[EU/1/13/904/004-006, EU/1/13/904/008-009]
How to open the tube with a child-resistant cap
To avoid spilling, do not squeeze the tube while opening or closing.
Push down on the cap and turn counterclockwise (turn to the left). Then pull the cap off.
How to close the tube with a child-resistant cap
Push down and turn clockwise (turn to the right).
[EU/1/13/904/007]
How to open the pump with a child-resistant cap
Push down on the cap and turn counterclockwise (turn to the left) until the cap can be removed.
Note: when the cap is removed, the pump is not child-resistant.
Before the first use, prime the pump by pressing down several times until the medicine is idispensed 
onto your fingertip.
To apply Mirvaso gel to your face, dispense a pea-sized amount of Mirvaso from the pump onto your 
fingertip. Continue to press down the pump to get the number of pea sizes you need according to your 
doctor s prescription (but no more than 5 pea sizes in total).
To close the pump, place the cap back on the pump. Push down and turn the cap to the right 
(clockwise) until it stops. The pump is child-resistant again.
If you use more Mirvaso than you should
If you use more than the maximum daily dose of 1 gram within a 24 hour period, it could lead to skin 
irritation or other side effects at the application site. Repeated doses within the same 24 hour period 
could result in side effects, such as low blood pressure, drowsiness or sleepiness.
Please contact your doctor, who will advise you on what action to take.
If anyone, especially a child, accidentally swallows Mirvaso, they may have serious side effects 
and need to be treated in a hospital.
Contact your doctor immediately or go to a hospital emergency department right away if you, a child, 
or anyone else swallows this medicine and has any of these symptoms: feeling dizzy from low blood 
pressure, vomiting, tiredness or drowsiness, decreased or irregular heartbeats, small pupils (constricted 
pupils), difficult or slow breathing, floppiness, low body temperature and convulsions (fits). Take the 
medicine pack with you, so the doctor knows what was swallowed.
If you forget to use Mirvaso
Mirvaso works on a daily basis, starting with the first day of treatment. If you miss a daily dose, your 
redness will not be reduced for that day. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose and 
continue your treatment as prescribed.
If you stop using Mirvaso
A potential consequence of stopping the treatment before finishing the course of treatment is the 
disease to come back to its initial state. Please contact your doctor before stopping your treatment, so 
that he could advice a replacement treatment as appropriate.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
