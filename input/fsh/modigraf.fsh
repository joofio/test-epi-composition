Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Modigraf  </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have had liver problems.  </li>
<li>if you have diarrhoea for more than one day.  </li>
<li>if you feel strong abdominal pain accompanied or not with other symptoms, such as chills, 
fever, nausea or vomiting. </li>
<li>if you have an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called  QT prolongation . </li>
<li>if you have or have had damage to the smallest blood vessels, known as thrombotic 
microangiopathy/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Tell 
your doctor if you develop fever, bruising under the skin (which may appear as red dots), 
unexplained tiredness, confusion, yellowing of the skin or eyes, reduced urine output, vision </li>
</ul>
<p>loss and seizures (see section 4). When tacrolimus is taken together with sirolimus or 
everolimus, the risk of developing these symptoms may increase. </p>
<p>Please avoid taking any herbal remedies, e.g., St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or any other 
herbal products as this may affect the effectiveness and the dose of Modigraf that you need to receive. 
If in doubt please consult your doctor prior to taking any herbal products or remedies.  </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to adjust your dose of Modigraf.  </p>
<p>You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do 
blood, urine, heart, eye tests, to set the right dose of Modigraf.  </p>
<p>You should limit your exposure to the sun and UV (ultraviolet) light whilst taking Modigraf. This is 
because immunosuppressants like Modigraf could increase the risk of skin cancer. In case of sun 
exposure, wear appropriate protective clothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor.  </p>
<p>Precaution for handling: 
Direct contact with any part of your body like your skin or eyes, or breathing in of injection solutions, 
powder or granules contained in tacrolimus products should be avoided during preparation. If such 
contact occurs, wash the skin and eyes. 
Other medicines and Modigraf 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>It is not recommended that Modigraf is taken with ciclosporin (another medicine used for the 
prevention of transplant organ rejection).  </p>
<p>If you need to attend a doctor other than your transplant specialist, tell the doctor that you are 
taking tacrolimus. Your doctor may need to consult your transplant specialist if you should use 
another medicine that could increase or decrease your tacrolimus blood level. </p>
<p>Modigraf blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other 
medicines can be affected by taking Modigraf, which may require interruption, an increase or a 
decrease in Modigraf dose.  </p>
<p>Some patients have experienced increases in tacrolimus blood levels while taking other medicines. 
This could lead to serious side effects, such as kidney problems, nervous system problems, and heart 
rhythm disturbances (see section 4).<br />
An effect on the Modigraf blood levels may occur very soon after starting the use of another medicine, 
therefore frequent continued monitoring of your Modigraf blood level may be needed within the first 
few days of starting another medicine and frequently while treatment with the other medicine 
continues. Some other medicines may cause tacrolimus blood levels to decrease, which could increase 
the risk of rejecting the transplanted organ. In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking 
or have recently taken medicines like:</p>
<ul>
<li>antifungal medicines and antibiotics, particularly so-called macrolide antibiotics, used to treat 
infections e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, 
clotrimazole, isavuconazole, miconazole, caspofungin, telithromycin, erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, josamycin, azithromycin, rifampicin, rifabutin, isoniazid and flucloxacillin </li>
<li>letermovir, used to prevent illness caused by CMV (human cytomegalovirus)  </li>
<li>HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), the booster medicine cobicistat, 
and combination tablets, or HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz, 
etravirine, nevirapine) used to treat HIV infection  </li>
<li>
<p>HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., telaprevir, boceprevir, the combination 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, and 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir), used to treat hepatitis C infection </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nilotinib and imatinib, idelalisib, ceritinib, crizotinib, apalutamide, enzalutamide, or mitotane 
(used to treat certain cancers) </p>
</li>
<li>mycophenolic acid, used to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection  </li>
<li>medicines for stomach ulcer and acid reflux (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole or cimetidine)  </li>
<li>antiemetics, used to treat nausea and vomiting (e.g.,  metoclopramide)  </li>
<li>cisapride or the antacid magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide, used to treat heartburn  </li>
<li>the contraceptive pill, hormone treatments with ethinylestradiol, or hormone treatments with 
danazol  </li>
<li>medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g., nifedipine, nicardipine, 
diltiazem and verapamil)  </li>
<li>anti-arrhythmic medicines (amiodarone) used to control arrhythmia (uneven beating of the 
heart) </li>
<li>medicines known as  statins  used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides  </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy  </li>
<li>metamizole, used to treat pain and fever </li>
<li>the corticosteroids prednisolone and methylprednisolone, belonging to the class of 
corticosteroids used to treat inflammations or suppress the immune system (e.g., in transplant 
rejection) </li>
<li>nefazodone, used to treat depression  </li>
<li>herbal preparations containing St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or extracts of 
Schisandra sphenanthera. </li>
<li>cannabidiol (uses amongst others include treatment of seizures) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are receiving treatment for hepatitis C. The drug treatment for hepatitis C may 
change your liver function and may affect blood levels of tacrolimus. Tacrolimus blood levels may fall 
or may increase depending on the medicines prescribed for hepatitis C. Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels and make necessary adjustments of Modigraf dose after you 
start treatment for hepatitis C. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking or need to take ibuprofen (used to treat fever, inflammation and 
pain), antibiotics (cotrimoxazole, vancomycin, or aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin), 
amphotericin B (used to treat fungal infections) or antivirals (used to treat viral infections e.g. 
acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet). These may worsen kidney or nervous system problems 
when taken together with Modigraf.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking sirolimus or everolimus. When tacrolimus is taken together with 
sirolimus or everolimus, the risk of developing thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura, and haemolytic uraemic syndrome may increase (see section 4).  </p>
<p>Your doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or certain diuretics used for 
heart failure, hypertension and kidney disease, (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), or the 
antibiotics trimethoprim or cotrimoxazole that may increase levels of potassium in your blood, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. ibuprofen) used for fever, inflammation and 
pain, anticoagulants (blood thinners), or oral medicines for diabetes, while you take Modigraf.  </p>
<p>If you need to have any vaccinations, please tell your doctor before. 
Modigraf with food and drink<br />
You should generally take Modigraf on an empty stomach or at least 1 hour before or 2 to 3 hours after 
a meal. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking Modigraf, since it can affect its 
levels in the blood. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you take Modigraf during pregnancy, it may pass into your baby through the placenta. It could 
potentially influence the health of the baby or adversely influence the course of the pregnancy. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Modigraf passes into breast milk. Therefore, you should not breast-feed whilst using Modigraf. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy or sleepy, or have problems seeing clearly 
after taking Modigraf. These effects are more frequent if you also drink alcohol. 
Modigraf contains lactose and sodium<br />
Modigraf contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. Modigraf should be prescribed by doctors trained to treat transplant patients and 
experienced in the use of medicines that control the body s immune system (immunosuppressants). </p>
<p>Make sure that you receive the same tacrolimus medicine every time you collect your prescription, 
unless your transplant specialist has agreed to change to a different tacrolimus medicine.  </p>
<p>This medicine should be taken twice a day. If the physical appearance has changed from the normal 
white granules, or if dose instructions have changed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist as soon as 
possible to make sure that you have the right medicine.  </p>
<p>The starting dose to prevent the rejection of your transplanted organ will be determined by your doctor 
calculated according to your body weight. Initial doses just after transplantation will generally be in 
the range of 0.075 - 0.30 mg per kg body weight per day depending on the transplanted organ. When 
treating rejection, these same doses may be used. </p>
<p>Your dose depends on your general condition and on which other immunosuppressive medicines you 
are taking.<br />
Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents will receive doses of Modigraf calculated in the same way as adults. In 
general children need higher doses per kg of body weight to achieve the same effective levels in the 
blood as adults. </p>
<p>Following the initiation of your treatment with Modigraf, frequent blood tests will be taken by your 
doctor to define the correct dose and to adjust the dose from time to time. Your doctor will usually 
reduce your Modigraf dose once your condition has stabilised. Your doctor will tell you exactly how 
many sachets to take. </p>
<p>You will need to take Modigraf every day as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent rejection 
of your transplanted organ. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor.  </p>
<p>Modigraf is taken orally twice daily, usually in the morning and evening. Take Modigraf on an empty 
stomach or 2 to 3 hours after a meal. Wait at least 1 hour until the next meal.  </p>
<p>How to prepare the Modigraf sachets for use?<br />
Your doctor will advise you on the number of sachets that you need to open and the volume of water 
that is required to make a suspension. For accurate measuring the volume of water you can use a 
syringe or graduated cylinder.  </p>
<p>Pour the prescribed volume of water (at room temperature) into a glass or cup, up to a maximum of 
50 ml. Place the cup with water on a stable surface. Do not use cups or spoons that are made of PVC 
(polyvinylchloride) to take Modigraf because the active substance in Modigraf may stick to PVC.  </p>
<p>Carefully open the prescribed number of sachets, e.g. with a pair of scissors at the point indicated with 
an arrow. Hold the opened sachet between thumb and index finger above the cup with the open side of 
the sachet facing downwards. Gently tap on the closed end of the sachet and pour the contents of each 
sachet into the glass or cup containing the water. Do not use any utensils or liquids to empty the 
sachet. If you follow these instructions, you will get the right amount of granules from the sachet. It is 
normal that some granules stay behind; the sachet was designed that way.<br />
Stir, or swirl gently until the granules have been suspended completely. The suspension can be drawn 
up with a syringe or swallowed directly by the patient. The liquid has a sweet taste. Rinse the glass or 
cup once with the same amount of water and drink this, too. The liquid should be drunk immediately 
after preparation. 
If you take more Modigraf than you should 
If you have accidentally taken too much Modigraf, contact your doctor or nearest hospital emergency 
department immediately. 
If you forget to take Modigraf 
Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.<br />
If you have forgotten to take your Modigraf, wait until it is time for the next dose, and then continue as 
before. 
If you stop taking Modigraf 
Stopping your treatment with Modigraf may increase the risk of rejection of your transplanted organ.<br />
Do not stop your treatment unless your doctor tells you to do so. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
