  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Mounjaro contains an active substance called tirzepatide and is used to treat adults with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Mounjaro reduces the level of sugar in the body only when the levels of sugar are 
high.  </p>
<p>Mounjaro is also used to treat adults with obesity or overweight (with BMI of at least 27 kg/m2). 
Mounjaro influences appetite regulation, which may help you eat less food and reduce your body 
weight. </p>
<p>In type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>on its own when you can t take metformin (another diabetes medicine). </li>
<li>with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. 
These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by injection. </li>
</ul>
<p>Mounjaro is also used together with diet and exercise for weight loss and to help keep the weight 
under control in adults, who have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BMI of 30 kg/m  or greater (obesity) or  </li>
<li>a BMI of at least 27 kg/m  but less than 30 kg/m  (overweight) and weight-related health 
problems (such as prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in 
the blood, breathing problems during sleep called  obstructive sleep apnoea  or a history of 
heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems) </li>
</ul>
<p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. 
It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to tirzepatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions <br />
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before using Mounjaro if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer 
than normal (including severe gastroparesis). </li>
<li>you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which may cause severe pain in 
the stomach and back which does not go away). </li>
<li>you have a problem with your eyes (diabetic retinopathy or macular oedema). </li>
<li>you are using a sulphonylurea (another diabetes medicine) or insulin for your diabetes, as low 
blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these 
other medicines to reduce this risk. </li>
</ul>
<p>When starting treatment with Mounjaro, in some cases you may experience loss of fluids/dehydration, 
e.g. due to vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea, which may lead to a decrease in kidney function. It is 
important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any 
questions or concerns. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Mounjaro<br />
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. This medicine should not be used during pregnancy as the effects of 
this medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception 
while using this medicine. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
It is unknown whether tirzepatide passes into breast milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be ruled 
out. If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you should stop breast-feeding or delay using 
Mounjaro. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
It is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you use 
Mounjaro in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may 
occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any 
signs of low blood sugar, e.g. headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling hungry, confusion, 
irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating (see section 4). See section 2,  Warnings and precautions  for 
information on increased risk of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. </p>
<p>Mounjaro contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. </p>
<p>How much to use 
* The starting dose is 2.5 mg once a week for four weeks. After four weeks your doctor will 
increase your dose to 5 mg once a week.<br />
* Your doctor may increase your dose by 2.5 mg increments to 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg or 
15 mg once a week if you need it. In each case your doctor will tell you to stay on a particular 
dose for at least 4 weeks before going to a higher dose. </p>
<p>Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to. </p>
<p>Each pen contains one dose of Mounjaro either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg.  </p>
<p>Choosing when to use Mounjaro<br />
You can use your pen at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same day 
each week if you can. To help you remember, when to use Mounjaro, you may wish to tick the day of 
the week when you inject your first dose on the box that your pen comes in, or mark it on a calendar. </p>
<p>If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly Mounjaro injection, as long as it has been at least 
3 days since your last injection. After selecting a new dosing day, continue with once-a-week dosing 
on that new day. </p>
<p>How to inject Mounjaro<br />
Mounjaro is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper 
leg (thigh) or upper arm. You may need help from someone else if you want to inject in your upper 
arm. </p>
<p>If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a 
different injection site within that area. If you also inject insulin choose a different injection site for 
that injection. </p>
<p>Read the  Instructions for Use  for the pen carefully before using Mounjaro. </p>
<p>Testing blood glucose levels<br />
If you are using Mounjaro with a sulphonylurea or insulin, it is important that you test your blood 
glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (see section 2,  Warnings and 
precautions ). </p>
<p>If you use more Mounjaro than you should<br />
If you use more Mounjaro than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this 
medicine may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Mounjaro<br />
If you forget to inject a dose and,<br />
* it has been 4 days or less since you should have used Mounjaro, use it as soon as you 
remember. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. 
* If it has been more than 4 days since you should have used Mounjaro, skip the missed dose. 
Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. </p>
<p>Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. The minimum time between two doses must 
be at least 3 days. </p>
<p>If you stop using Mounjaro<br />
Do not stop using Mounjaro without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Mounjaro, and you 
have type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar levels can increase. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
