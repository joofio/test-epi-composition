<p>if you have continuing nausea, vomiting, constipation, low energy, or muscle weakness. These 
may be signs there is too much calcium in your blood.</p>
<p>if you suffer from kidney stones or have had kidney stones.</p>
<p>if you suffer from kidney problems (moderate renal impairment).
Some patients get dizzy or get a fast heartbeat after the first few doses of Movymia. For the first doses, 
inject Movymia in a place where you can sit or lie down right away if you get dizzy.
The recommended treatment time of 24 months should not be exceeded.
Before inserting a cartridge in Movymia Pen write down the batch (Lot) number of the cartridge and 
its first injection date on the outer carton of the cartridge and provide this information when reporting 
any side effects.
Movymia should not be used in growing adults.
Children and adolescents
Movymia should not be used in children and adolescents (aged less than 18 years).
Other medicines and Movymia
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
This is important, because some medicines (e.g. digoxin/digitalis, a medicine used to treat heart 
disease) may interact with teriparatide.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Do not use Movymia if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are a woman of child-bearing 
potential, you should use effective methods of contraception during use of Movymia. If you become 
pregnant while using Movymia, Movymia should be discontinued. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice before taking this medicine.

Some patients may feel dizzy after injecting Movymia. If you feel dizzy you should not drive or use 
machines until you feel better.

you are not sure.
The recommended dose is 20 micrograms (corresponding to 80 microliters) given once a day by 
injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in the thigh or abdomen.
To help you remember to use your medicine, inject it at about the same time each day. Movymia can 
be injected at meal times. Inject Movymia each day for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. 
The total duration of treatment with Movymia should not exceed 24 months. You should not receive 
more than one treatment course of 24 months over your lifetime.
Your doctor may advise you to use Movymia with calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will tell you 
how much you should take each day.
Movymia can be given with or without food.
Movymia cartridges are designed to be used only with the Movymia Pen reusable, multidose medicine 
delivery system and compatible pen needles. The pen and injection needles are not included with 
Movymia. However, for treatment initiation a cartridge and pen pack should be used containing one 
inner carton of Movymia cartridge and one inner carton of Movymia Pen.
The pen can be used with injection needles developed according to the pen needle ISO standard of a 
gauge between 29 G and 31 G (diameter 0.25   0.33 mm) and a length between 5 mm to 12.7 mm for 
subcutaneous injection only.
Before the first use, insert the cartridge into the pen. For the correct use of this medicine it is very 
important to closely follow the detailed instructions for use of your pen which are provided with the 
pen.
Use a new injection needle for each injection to prevent contamination and safely dispose of the 
needle after use.
Never store your pen with the needle attached.
Never share your pen with others.
Do not use your Movymia Pen to inject any other medicine (e.g. insulin).
The pen is customised for use with Movymia only.
Do not refill the cartridge.
Do not transfer the medicine into a syringe.
You should inject Movymia shortly after you take the pen with inserted cartridge out of the 
refrigerator. Put the pen with inserted cartridge back into the refrigerator immediately after you have 
used it. Do not remove the cartridge from the pen after each use. Store it in the cartridge holder during 
the whole 28-day treatment period.
Preparing the pen for use
-
To ensure the correct administration of Movymia always read the instructions for use of
Movymia Pen, which is included in the carton of the pen.
-
Wash your hands before handling the cartridge or pen.
-
Check the expiry date on the cartridge label before inserting the cartridge into the pen. Make 
sure that there are at least 28 days remaining before its expiry date. Insert the cartridge into the 
pen before the first use as detailed in the pen instructions. Write down the batch (Lot) number of 
each cartridge and its first injection date on a calendar. The date of first injection should also be 
recorded on the outer carton of Movymia (see the provided space on the box: {First use:}).
-
After inserting a new cartridge and before the first injection from this cartridge prime the pen 
according to the instructions which are provided. Do not prime again after the first dose.
Injecting Movymia
-
Before you inject Movymia, clean your skin where you intend to inject (thigh or abdomen) as 
instructed by your doctor.
-
Gently hold a fold of cleansed skin and insert the needle straight into the skin. Press the push 
button and hold it pressed in until the dose indication has returned to the start position.
-
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for six seconds to make sure that you receive 
the whole dose.
-
As soon as you have finished the injection, attach the outer needle protective cap on the pen 
needle and screw the cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. This will keep the remaining 
Movymia sterile and prevent leaking from the pen. It will also stop air going back into the 
cartridge and the needle from clogging.
-
Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen.
If you use more Movymia than you should
If, by mistake, you have used more Movymia than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist.
The expected effects of overdose include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache.
If you forget to use Movymia
If you forget an injection or cannot use your medicine at your usual time, inject it as soon as possible 
on that day. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not take more than one 
injection in the same day.
If you stop using Movymia
If you are considering stopping Movymia treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor 
will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Movymia.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

Instructions for use
Movymia Pen
Re-usable pen injector to be used with Movymia cartridges for subcutaneous injections
Always follow instructions provided below and on the back page when using the Movymia Pen.
Movymia Pen parts
Pen preparation - First use/changing cartridges
Write down the first injection date of each new cartridge. This helps you to know when the 28 daily 
doses per cartridge are used (see section 2  Warnings and precautions  and section 3  Preparing the 
pen for use  in the Package leaflet of Movymia).
Follow the instructions every time you insert a new Movymia cartridge into your Movymia Pen. Do 
not repeat this before each daily injection, otherwise you will not have enough Movymia for 28 days.
Read the patient information leaflet for Movymia cartridge provided separately.
A: Remove the pen cap.
B: Remove the cartridge holder by turning it (bayonet coupling).
C: Remove the empty cartridge, in the case of changing cartridge. Insert a new Movymia cartridge 
into the cartridge holder, with the metal crimped cap of the cartridge first.
D: Push back the threaded rod carefully with your finger, in a straight line and as far as it will go. This 
is not necessary when the rod is already in the starting position, such as at the very first use. The 
threaded rod cannot be pushed back to the pen housing entirely.
E: Attach the cartridge holder to the housing by turning it 90 degrees, until it stops.
F: Attach a new pen needle as follows:
  Pull off the peel foil.
  Screw the pen needle clockwise onto the cartridge holder. Make sure that the pen needle is attached 
correctly and sits firmly on the cartridge holder.
  Remove the outer needle cap and save it.
  Remove and dispose the inner needle cap.
While attaching the needle some drops may escape, this is normal.
G: Priming
The pen must be primed and tested after inserting a new cartridge and prior the first injection from 
each cartridge.
  Turn the dose knob clockwise until you see a droplet sign on the dose display. Make sure that the 
two indicator stripes are aligned. During dose dialling the pen provides an audible clicking sound 
and a noticeable resistance.
  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards.
  Press the push button fully in. Hold it pressed in until the dose indication has turned back to the start 
position. Some drops of medicine must be expelled from the needle tip.
If no drops emerge, repeat step G until you see some drops. Do not repeat step G more than four times, 
but follow the instructions given under Troubleshooting section on the back page.
Administration using the Movymia Pen
Wash your hands carefully with soap to minimise the risk of infection.
Make sure you have ready:
  your Movymia Pen with inserted cartridge
  a compatible pen needle
  a puncture-resistant sharps disposal container for used needles.
Do not use the pen if the cartridge is cloudy, discoloured or contains particles.
Read the patient information leaflet for Movymia cartridge provided separately.
1. Attach the pen needle
Use a new needle for every injection. Do not use the pen needle if the packaging is damaged or not 
opened by yourself.
Note: There is no need to change the needle when using directly after the pen preparation. In this case 
continue with step  2. Setting the dose and injection .
  Pull off the peel foil.
  Screw the pen needle clockwise onto the cartridge holder. Make sure that the pen needle is attached 
correctly and sits firmly on the cartridge holder.
  Remove the outer needle cap and save it.
  Remove and dispose the inner needle cap.
While attaching the needle some drops may escape, this is normal.
2. Setting the dose and injection
Warning: Ensure the use of the correct medicine. Check the label of the cartridge before its insertion 
into the cartridge holder.
  To set the fixed daily dose of 80 microliters, turn the dose knob clockwise until it stops and cannot 
be rotated any further. Make sure the display shows an arrow sign and it is aligned with the indicator 
stripe. During dose dialling the pen provides an audible clicking sound and a noticeable resistance. 
Do not try to force the dose knob any further.
Note: If the cartridge contains less than 80 microliters, the dose knob cannot be turned clockwise up to 
the arrow sign. In this case, remove the pen needle, change the cartridge and proceed with priming 
according the pen preparation steps.
  Select an appropriate injection site and prepare your skin as recommended by your doctor. Gently 
hold a skin fold between the thumb and index finger. Insert the needle straight and gently into the 
skin, as shown in the illustration.
Warning: Prevent the pen needle from bending or breaking. Do not tilt the pen after the needle has 
been inserted into the skin. Tilting the pen may result in bending or breaking of the needle. Broken 
needles can get stuck in the skin. Immediately consult the doctor if a broken needle gets stuck in the 
skin.
  Press the push button until the dose indication has returned to the start position. Keep the needle in 
the skin fold for a further 6 seconds.
  Pull out the pen slowly. Check if the display is at the start position to make sure that the full dose 
has been injected.
3. Removing the pen needle
  Carefully attach the outer needle cap on the pen needle.
  Screw the needle cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. Dispose of it correctly, for example, 
in a puncture-resistant sharps disposal container.
4. Re-attach pen cap
  Do not remove the cartridge from the Movymia Pen before it is empty.
  Re-attach the pen cap after each use.
  Put the Movymia Pen, with the cartridge inserted, back into the refrigerator between 2 and 8  C 
immediately after use.
Note for healthcare professionals
Local, healthcare professional or institutional policies may replace the instructions regarding needle 
handling and disposal.
