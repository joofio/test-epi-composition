MULTAQ,  </li>
<li>if you have a very slow heart beat (less than 50 beats a minute), </li>
<li>if your ECG (electrocardiogram) shows a heart problem called  prolonged QT corrected 
interval  (this interval is more than 500 milliseconds), </li>
<li>if you have a type of atrial fibrillation called permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). In permanent

flow to your organs, </li>
<li>if you have or had a problem where your heart cannot pump the blood round your body as well 
as it should (condition called heart failure). You may have swollen feet or legs, trouble 
breathing when lying down or sleeping, or shortness of breath when moving around,  </li>
<li>if the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts is too low (condition called 
left ventricular dysfunction), </li>

liver problems, </li>
<li>if you take medicines for infection (including fungal infection or AIDS), allergies, heart beat

problem should be corrected before starting treatment with MULTAQ, 
* you are more than 75 years old, 
* you have a condition when the vessel that supplies blood to heart muscle becomes hardened and 
narrowed (coronary artery disease). </p>
<p>While taking MULTAQ, tell your doctor if<br />
* your atrial fibrillation becomes permanent while you are taking MULTAQ. You should stop 
taking MULTAQ, 
* you have swollen feet or legs, trouble breathing when lying down or sleeping, shortness of

<p>If this applies to you (or you are not sure), please talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
MULTAQ.  </p>
<p>Heart, lung and blood tests 
While you are taking MULTAQ, your doctor may perform tests to check your medical condition and 
how the medicine is working for you. 
* Your doctor may look at your heart s electrical activity using an ECG (electrocardiogram) 
machine. 
* Your doctor will order blood tests to check your liver function before you start taking 
MULTAQ and during treatment.<br />
<em> If you are taking some medicines against blood clot formation such as warfarin, your doctor will 
order a blood test called INR to check how well your medicine is working.<br />
</em> Your doctor may also do other blood tests. The results of one of the blood tests to check kidney 
function (blood creatinine levels) may be changed by MULTAQ. Your doctor will take this into 
account when checking your blood levels and will use another reference of the  normal  value 
of blood creatinine.<br />
* Your doctor may check your lungs. 
In some cases, MULTAQ treatment may need to be stopped. 
Please tell any other person who checks your blood that you are taking MULTAQ. </p>
