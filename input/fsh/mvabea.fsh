Mvabea is a vaccine used to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.
It is given to people aged 1 year and older who may possibly come into contact with Ebola virus.
Mvabea is given as the second dose of a 2-dose course of vaccinations to protect you from getting 
Ebola virus disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus, which is a type of Filovirus. This vaccine will not 
protect you against the other types of Filovirus. 
Because Mvabea does not contain the whole Ebola virus, it cannot give you Ebola virus disease.
The 2-dose course of vaccinations consists of:</p>
<p>a first dose of Zabdeno vaccine,</p>
<p>followed around 8 weeks later by a dose with Mvabea vaccine.
Even after you have had the course of Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccination you should be very careful
not to come into contact with Ebola virus. As with all vaccinations, the vaccination course may not 
fully protect everyone from Ebola virus disease.
The Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccinations should be used according to official 
recommendations.
What is Ebola</p>
<p>Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. People catch Ebola from people or animals who are 
infected with Ebola virus or who died from Ebola.</p>
<p>You can catch Ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat, breast 
milk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with Ebola virus.</p>
<p>You can also catch Ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person or 
animal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).</p>
<p>Ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.
Ebola virus disease usually causes a high fever   and it can stop the blood from clotting, causing 
severe bleeding ( severe haemorrhagic fever ). This can lead to serious illness, and in some cases 
death.</p>
<p>First signs and symptoms may be fever, feeling tired, weak or dizzy, and muscle aches.</p>
<p>Later signs and symptoms may include bleeding under the skin, into organs in the body such as 
the liver or kidneys and from the mouth, eyes or ears. Some people get severe diarrhea, sudden 
drop in blood pressure or blood flow to the organs in the body (shock) which may cause serious 
and permanent damage to these organs, severe confusion (delirium), fits (seizures), kidney 
failure and coma.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first to decide if you should be given this vaccine.
How the vaccine works
The Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose vaccine course stimulates the body s natural defences (immune 
system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the 
virus that causes the Ebola infection. This will help to protect against Ebola virus disease in the future.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Mvabea if you or your child:</p>
<p>have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection,</p>
<p>have ever fainted, after having an injection,</p>
<p>have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily,</p>
<p>currently have a fever or an infection,</p>
<p>are taking medicines that weaken the immune system, such as high-dose corticosteroids (such as 
prednisone) or chemotherapy (cancer medicines),</p>
<p>have a weak immune system   for example, due to HIV infection or an illness that runs in the 
family ( genetic disorder ).
If any of the above apply to you or your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Mvabea.
If you are at high risk of being in contact with the Ebola virus, a booster vaccination with Zabdeno
may be recommended for you or your child. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if this applies to 
you or your child.
If you or your child only have one of the vaccines, Zabdeno or Mvabea, it may give less protection
from Ebola virus disease than having a course of both vaccines.
As with all vaccines, the Zabdeno and Mvabea 2-dose course of vaccination may not fully protect 
everyone from Ebola virus disease and it is not known how long you will be protected.</p>
<p>People who have been given the 2-dose course of vaccination should still take precautions 
to avoid coming into contact with Ebola virus.
Washing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like
Ebola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to
person.
Proper hand washing methods are described below.</p>
<p>Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. There is no 
need to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands.</p>
<p>Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. Do not use alcohol-based hand 
sanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.
While in an area affected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the following:</p>
<p>Contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, 
semen, and vaginal fluids).</p>
<p>Items that may have come in contact with an infected person s blood or body fluids (such as 
clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).</p>
<p>Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.</p>
<p>Contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these 
animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.</p>
<p>Contact with semen from a man who had Ebola. You should follow safe sex practices until the 
virus is gone from the semen. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice about how 
long to maintain safe sex practices.
Children younger than 1 year of age
There is no recommendation for use of Mvabea in children younger than 1 year of age.
Other medicines and Mvabea
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take, any 
other medicines or vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before having this vaccine if you or your child is pregnant or 
breast-feeding. Also do this if you think you or your child may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby.
Driving and using machines
Mvabea has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
Mvabea contains Sodium
Mvabea contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 0.5 mL, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""
