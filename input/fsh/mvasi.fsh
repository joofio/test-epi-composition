  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>MVASI contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a 
type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection 
and cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF 
protein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with 
nutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking 
the growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. </p>
<p>MVASI is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, 
i.e. in the colon or rectum. MVASI will be administered in combination with chemotherapy treatment 
containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine. </p>
<p>MVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for 
patients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called 
paclitaxel or capecitabine. </p>
<p>MVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
MVASI will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. </p>
<p>MVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer when 
cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
MVASI will be administered in combination with erlotinib. </p>
<p>MVASI is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for 
patients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. </p>
<p>MVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. </p>
<p>When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, MVASI will be administered in 
combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. </p>
<p>When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, MVASI will be administered in 
combination with paclitaxel, or topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. </p>
<p>MVASI is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer. MVASI will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, 
paclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>you are allergic (hypersensitive) to bevacizumab or to any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
<li>you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell products or to other 
recombinant human or humanised antibodies. </li>
<li>you are pregnant. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using MVASI </p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible that MVASI may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you have 
conditions causing inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, colitis 
associated with chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor. </li>
<li>MVASI may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway between 
two organs or vessels. The risk of developing connections between the vagina and any parts of 
the gut can increase if you have persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. </li>
<li>MVASI can increase the risk of bleeding or increase the risk of problems with wound healing 
after surgery. If you are going to have an operation, if you have had major surgery within the 
last 28 days or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery, you should not receive 
this medicine. </li>
<li>MVASI may increase the risk of developing serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under 
the skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing. </li>
<li>MVASI can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure 
which is not well controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your doctor as it is 
important to make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting MVASI 
treatment. </li>
<li>MVASI increases the risk of having protein in your urine especially if you already have high 
blood pressure. </li>
<li>The risk of developing blood clots in your arteries (a type of blood vessel) can increase if you 
are over 65 years old, if you have diabetes, or if you have had previous blood clots in your 
arteries. Please talk to your doctor since blood clots can lead to heart attack and stroke. </li>
<li>MVASI can also increase the risk of developing blood clots in your veins (a type of blood 
vessel). </li>
<li>MVASI may cause bleeding, especially tumour-related bleeding. Please consult your doctor if 
you or your family tend to suffer from bleeding problems or you are taking medicines to thin the 
blood for any reason. </li>
<li>It is possible that MVASI may cause bleeding in and around your brain. Please discuss this with 
your doctor if you have metastatic cancer affecting your brain. </li>
<li>It is possible that MVASI can increase the risk of bleeding in your lungs, including coughing or 
spitting blood. Please discuss with your doctor if you noticed this previously. </li>
<li>MVASI can increase the risk of developing a weak heart. It is important that your doctor knows 
if you have ever received anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin, a specific type of 
chemotherapy used to treat some cancers) or had radiotherapy to your chest, or if you have heart 
disease. </li>
<li>MVASI may cause infections and a decreased number of your neutrophils (a type of blood cell 
important for your protection against bacteria). </li>
<li>It is possible that MVASI can cause hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic shock) and/or 
infusion reactions (reactions related to your injection of the medicine). Please let your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse know if you have previously experienced problems after injections, such as 
dizziness/feeling of fainting, breathlessness, swelling or skin rash. </li>
<li>A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
has been associated with MVASI treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, confusion or 
seizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor. </li>
<li>If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past. </p>
<p>Before you are given MVASI or while you are being treated with MVASI: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, 
numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your doctor and 
dentist immediately. </li>
<li>if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you 
are being treated with MVASI (bevacizumab), in particular when you are also receiving or have 
received an injection of bisphosphonate into your blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>You may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with MVASI. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>MVASI use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the 
safety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations. </p>
<p>Death of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw have been reported in patients under 
18 years old when treated with bevacizumab. </p>
<p>Other medicines and MVASI </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Combinations of MVASI with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and 
gastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you 
do not combine these medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast 
cancer. These therapies in combination with MVASI may increase the risk of severe side effects. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>You must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. MVASI may cause damage to your unborn baby 
as it may stop the formation of new blood vessels. Your doctor should advise you about using 
contraception during treatment with MVASI and for at least 6 months after the last dose of MVASI. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you are pregnant, become pregnant during treatment with this 
medicine, or plan to become pregnant in the near future. </p>
<p>You must not breast-feed your baby during treatment with MVASI and for at least 6 months after the 
last dose of MVASI, as this medicine may interfere with the growth and development of your baby. </p>
<p>MVASI may impair female fertility. Please consult your doctor for more information. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>MVASI has not been shown to reduce your ability to drive or to use any tools or machines. However, 
sleepiness and fainting have been reported with MVASI use. If you experience symptoms that affect 
your vision or concentration, or your ability to react, do not drive and use machines until symptoms 
disappear. </p>
<p>MVASI contains sodium </p>
<p>MVASI 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion (4 mL) </p>
<p>This medicine contains 5.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 4 mL vial. This 
is equivalent to 0.3% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>MVASI 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion (16 mL) </p>
<p>This medicine contains 21.7 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 16 mL vial. 
This is equivalent to 1.1% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The dose of MVASI needed depends on your body weight and the kind of cancer to be treated. The 
recommended dose is 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg per kilogram of your body weight. Your doctor 
will prescribe a dose of MVASI that is right for you. You will be treated with MVASI once every 2 or 
3 weeks. The number of infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to 
treatment; you should continue to receive this medicine until MVASI fails to stop your tumour 
growing. Your doctor will discuss this with you. </p>
<p>Method and route of administration </p>
<p>Do not shake the vial. MVASI is a concentrate for solution for infusion. Depending on the dose 
prescribed for you, some or all of the contents of the MVASI vial will be diluted with sodium chloride 
solution before use. A doctor or nurse will give you this diluted MVASI solution by intravenous 
infusion (a drip into your vein). The first infusion will be given to you over 90 minutes. If this is well-
tolerated the second infusion may be given over 60 minutes. Later infusions may be given to you over 
30 minutes. </p>
<p>The administration of MVASI should be temporarily discontinued </p>
<ul>
<li>if you develop severe high blood pressure requiring treatment with blood pressure medicines, </li>
<li>if you have problems with wound healing following surgery, </li>
<li>if you undergo surgery. </li>

<li>serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under the skin, </li>
<li>a blood clot in your arteries, </li>
<li>a blood clot in the blood vessels of your lungs, </li>
<li>any severe bleeding. </li>
</ul>
<p>If too much MVASI is given </p>
<ul>
<li>you may develop a severe migraine. If this happens you should talk to your doctor, pharmacist

irregular or are missed and may experience impaired fertility. If you are considering having children 
you should discuss this with your doctor before your treatment starts. </p>
<p>MVASI has been developed and made to treat cancer by injecting it into the bloodstream. It has not 
been developed or made for injection into the eye. It is therefore not authorised to be used in this way. 
When bevacizumab is injected directly into the eye (unapproved use), the following side effects may 
occur: </p>
<ul>
<li>infection or inflammation of the eye globe, </li>
<li>redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain, </li>
<li>seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision, </li>
<li>increased eye pressure, </li>
<li>bleeding in the eye. </li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting
