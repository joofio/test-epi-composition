leptin. </p>
<p>What Myalepta is used for 
Myalepta is used to treat the complications of not having enough leptin in patients with lipodystrophy. </p>
<p>It is used in adults, adolescents and children 2 years or over:</p>
<ul>
<li>who have generalised lipodystrophy (the whole of your body does not have enough fatty 
tissue)  </li>
</ul>
<p>It is used, when other treatments have been ineffective, in adults, and adolescents 12 years or over:</p>
<ul>
<li>who have partial lipodystrophy which is inherited (also called congenital or familial 
lipodystrophy)  </li>
<li>or partial lipodystrophy has been caused by your body s response to something such as a viral 
illness (also called acquired lipodystrophy) </li>
</ul>
<p>How Myalepta works 
Natural leptin is produced by fatty tissue and has many functions in the body including:</p>
<ul>
<li>controlling how hungry you feel and your energy levels </li>
<li>helping the insulin in your body manage sugar levels. 
Metreleptin works by copying the effects of leptin. This improves the ability of the body to control 
energy levels. </li>

- you are allergic to metreleptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Myalepta if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are pregnant </li>
<li>you have ever had a type of cancer called lymphoma </li>
<li>you have ever had problems with your blood (such as a low blood count) </li>
<li>you have ever had inflammation of an organ called the pancreas ( pancreatitis ) </li>
<li>you have or ever have had problems with your immune system (autoimmune disease including 
autoimmune-related liver problems) </li>
</ul>
<p>Lymphoma </p>
<p>People with lipodystrophy can get a type of blood cancer called lymphoma, whether or not they are 
using Myalepta. 
However, you may be at higher risk of getting a lymphoma when using the medicinal product. 
Your doctor will decide if you should use Myalepta and will monitor you during treatment. </p>
<p>Serious and severe infections </p>
<p>While being treated with Myalepta, your body might produce antibodies which may increase the risk 
of developing serious or severe infections. Tell your doctor straight-away if you develop a high 
temperature, accompanied by increasing tiredness (see section 4). </p>
<p>Low blood sugar with insulin or other anti-diabetic medicines </p>
<p>If you are using a medicine such as insulin or other medicines to treat diabetes, your doctor will 
closely monitor your blood sugar. Your doctor will change your dose of insulin or other medicines if 
needed. 
This is to prevent your blood sugar from getting too low ( hypo-glycaemia ). For signs of low blood 
sugar levels, see section 4 under  Signs of high and low blood sugar'. </p>
<p>High blood sugar and fat levels </p>
<p>You may have higher amounts of sugar ( hyper-glycaemia ) or fat ( hyper-triglyceridaemia ) in your 
blood while on Myalepta, which may be a sign that this medicine is not working as well as it should. 
Signs of high blood sugar levels and high fat levels are listed in section 4 under  Signs of high and low 
blood sugar  and  Signs of high fat . 
If you notice any of the symptoms referred to above and described further in section 4 of this leaflet, 
or you are not sure, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor might need to change your 
treatment. </p>
<p>Autoimmune disease </p>
<p>People who have or have had problems with their immune system (autoimmune disease, including 
autoimmune-related liver problems) may have worsening of their symptoms with Myalepta. Talk to 
your healthcare provider about what symptoms you should watch for that would warrant further 
testing. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions </p>
<p>While being treated with Myalepta, you may get an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor straight-away if 
you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction can be seen in section 4 
under  Allergic reactions . </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>Myalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy (see section  Pregnancy, 
breast-feeding and fertility ). </p>
<p>Myalepta contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free . </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years with generalised lipodystrophy, or 
below the age of 12 years with partial lipodystrophy. This is because it is not known how this 
medicine will affect children under these ages. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Myalepta 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Myalepta can 
affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way this 
medicine works. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* hormonal contraceptives as Myalepta may reduce how well they work at preventing pregnancy 
* theophylline used in lung problems such as asthma 
* blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin or phenprocoumon) 
* medicines which suppress the immune system (such as cyclosporine) 
* anti-diabetic medicines (such as insulin or insulin secretagogues), see section 2  Low blood sugar 
with insulin or other anti-diabetic medicines   </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before using Myalepta. Some 
medicines need to be monitored while you are using Myalepta since the dose of these medicines might 
need to be changed. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not use Myalepta if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. This is because it is not 
known how Myalepta will affect your unborn baby. Women who could get pregnant should use 
effective contraception, including non-hormonal methods such as condoms, while using Myalepta. 
Discuss appropriate contraceptive methods with your doctor as Myalepta may reduce how well 
hormonal contraceptives work at preventing pregnancy. </p>
<p>It is not known if Myalepta will pass into breast milk. Talk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding or 
plan to do so. You and your doctor will decide whether or not to continue breast-feeding while using 
this medicine, considering the benefit of breast-feeding the baby and the benefit of Myalepta to the 
mother.  </p>
<p>Myalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Myalepta has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You might feel dizzy or tired 
when using this medicine. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines. Talk to your 
doctor if you are not sure.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Myalepta is an injection once a day under the skin ( subcutaneous injection ). This medicine is for use 
in children aged 2 years and above, adolescents and adults with generalised lipodystrophy; it is also for 
use in children aged 12 years and above, adolescents and adults with partial lipodystrophy.<br />
While using this medicine, you or your child will be monitored by your doctor, who will decide the 
dose you or your child should use. </p>
<p>Your doctor may decide that you inject the medicine yourself. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will 
show you how to prepare and inject this medicine. 
* Do not try to prepare the medicine or inject yourself if you have not been trained. </p>
<p>How much to inject 
Your dose of Myalepta may change over time depending on how this medicine works for you. The 
Myalepta powder is dissolved by mixing it with water for injections to make the solution for injecting. 
Read the  Instructions for Use for how to make the solution before injecting. 
Your doctor will have prescribed the correct dose for you, based on the following: 
* If you weigh 40 kg or less: </p>
<p>A starting dose is 0.06 mg (0.012 mL of solution) for each kilogram of body weight. 
* If you are male and weigh more than 40 kg: </p>
<p>A starting dose is 2.5 mg (0.5 mL of solution). 
* If you are female and weigh more than 40 kg: </p>
<p>A starting dose is 5 mg (1 mL of solution). 
Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much of the solution to inject. If you are not sure how 
much of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before injecting. 
* The syringe you need to use to inject this medicine depends on the dose prescribed for you. * 
Your pharmacist will give you the correct syringe for injecting. * 
See the  Instructions for Use  to find out which syringe to use. 
* To know how much medicine to inject (in mL), you divide your dose (in mg) by 5.* 
For example, if you have been prescribed a 5 mg dose of Myalepta, 5 mg divided by 5 gives 
you 1 mL which is the amount you need to inject of the solution, using a 1 mL syringe. 
* If your dose is 1.50 mg (0.30 mL of solution) or less, you will need to use a 0.3 mL syringe. * 
The 0.3 mL syringe will show the injection amount in  Unit  instead of  mL . See the 
 Instructions for Use  (section 7) for more information on reading and using the different 
syringes. * 
To know how much solution to inject (in Units), divide your dose (in mg) by 5, and then 
times it by 100. If you need to inject 1 mL or more of Myalepta solution, your doctor might tell you to give the dose as 
two separate injections. This can help make the injections more comfortable. 
You must use a clean syringe and needle for both injections. 
If you are not sure how much of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before 
injecting. 
When small doses/volumes are prescribed (e.g. in children), the vials will remain almost completely 
filled with product after withdrawal of the required dose. Remaining solution should be discarded after 
use. </p>
<p>If you use more Myalepta than you should 
If you use more Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Your 
doctor will monitor you for side effects. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Myalepta 
* If you forget to inject a dose, inject it as soon as you remember. 
* Then have your normal dose the next day. 
* Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have injected less Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
monitor you for side effects. </p>
<p>If you stop using Myalepta 
Do not stop using Myalepta without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will decide if you should stop 
using this medicine. </p>
<p>If you need to stop using Myalepta, your doctor will gradually reduce the dose over two weeks before 
stopping it altogether. Your doctor will also ask you to follow a reduced fat diet. 
* It is important to gradually reduce the dose over two weeks because this can help prevent a 
sudden increase in the levels of fat (called  triglycerides ) in your blood. 
* A sudden increase in the amount of triglyceride in your blood can make your pancreas 
inflamed ( pancreatitis ). Gradually reducing your dose, and following a reduced fat diet may 
help to prevent this. 
You should not stop using Myalepta unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
