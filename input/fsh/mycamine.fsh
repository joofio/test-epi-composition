  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Mycamine contains the active substance micafungin. Mycamine is called an antifungal medicine 
because it is used to treat infections caused by fungal cells. 
Mycamine is used to treat fungal infections caused by fungal or yeast cells called Candida. Mycamine 
is effective in treating systemic infections (those that have penetrated within the body). It interferes 
with the production of a part of the fungal cell wall. An intact cell wall is necessary for the fungus to 
continue living and growing. Mycamine causes defects in the fungal cell wall, making the fungus 
unable to live and grow. </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed Mycamine for you in the following circumstances when there are no other 
suitable antifungal treatments available (see section 2): </p>
<ul>
<li>To treat adults, adolescents and children including neonates who have a serious fungal infection 
called invasive candidiasis (infection that has penetrated the body). </li>
<li>To treat adults and adolescents   16 years of age who have a fungal infection in the gullet 
(oesophagus) where treatment into a vein (intravenous) is appropriate. </li>
<li>To prevent infection with Candida in patients who are having a bone-marrow transplant or who 
are expected to have a neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) for days or more. </li>

- if you are allergic to micafungin, other echinocandins (Ecalta or Cancidas) or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
In rats, long-term treatment with micafungin led to liver damage and subsequent liver tumours. The 
potential risk of developing liver tumours in humans is not known, and your doctor will assess the 
benefits and risks of Mycamine treatment before starting your medicine. Please tell your doctor if you 
have severe liver problems (e.g. liver failure or hepatitis) or have had abnormal liver function tests. 
During treatment your liver functions will be monitored more closely. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Mycamine 
- if you are allergic to any medicine. 
- if you have haemolytic anaemia (anaemia due to breakdown of red blood cells) or haemolysis 
(breakdown of red blood cells). 
- if you have kidney problems (e.g. kidney failure and abnormal kidney function test). If this 
happens, your doctor may decide to monitor your kidney function more closely. </p>
<p>Micafungin may also cause severe inflammation/eruption of the skin and mucous membranes 
(Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis). 
Other medicines and Mycamine 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>It is especially important to inform your doctor if you are using amphotericin B desoxycholate or 
itraconazole (antifungal antibiotics), sirolimus (an immunosuppressant) or nifedipine (calcium channel 
blocker used to treat high blood pressure). Your doctor may decide to adjust the dose of these 
medicines. 
Mycamine with food and drink<br />
As Mycamine is given intravenously (into a vein), no restrictions on food or drink are required. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant of breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Mycamine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you use Mycamine you 
should not breast-feed. 
Driving and using machines 
Micafungin is unlikely to have an effect on driving or using machines. However some people may feel 
dizzy when taking this medicine and if this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. 
Please inform your doctor if you experience any effects that may cause you to have problems with 
driving or using other machinery. </p>

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
