Mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, 
you must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the 
contraception advice given to you by your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of 
mycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before 
you take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under  Warnings and 
precautions  and  Pregnancy and breast-feeding . </p>
<p>Do not take Myclausen 
* If you are allergic to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* If you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test 
before your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. 
* If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant 
* If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). 
* If you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Do not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking Myclausen. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with Myclausen 
* If you are older than 65 years as you may have an increased risk of developing adverse events 
such as certain viral infections, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary oedema when 
compared to younger patients 
* If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
* If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
* If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer 
* If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are 
taking Myclausen. 
* If you have a hereditary enzyme deficiency such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller </p>
<p>syndrome </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting 
treatment with Myclausen. </p>
<p>The effect of sunlight 
Myclausen reduces your body s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit 
the amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
* wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
* using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years because based on the limited safety and 
efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Myclausen 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This 
is because Myclausen can affect the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect 
the way Myclausen works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before 
you start Myclausen: 
* azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system (given after a transplant 
operation) 
* cholestyramine (used to treat high cholesterol) 
* rifampicin (an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB)) 
* antacids or proton pump inhibitors (used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion) 
* phosphate binders (used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate 
gets absorbed into their blood). 
* antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) 
* isavuconazole (used to treat fungal infections) 
* telmisartan (used to treat high blood pressure) </p>
<p>Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while taking Myclausen, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist first. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. </p>
<p>You must not donate blood during treatment with Myclausen and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with Myclausen and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Myclausen with food and drink 
Taking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with Myclausen. </p>
<p>Contraception in women taking Myclausen 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use an effective method of contraception 
with Myclausen. This includes: 
* Before you start taking Myclausen 
* During your entire treatment with Myclausen 
* For 6 weeks after you stop taking Myclausen. 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended 
pregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not 
have been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. </p>
<p>You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
* You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year 
ago (if your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a 
chance you could become pregnant) 
* Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy) 
* Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
* Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a 
specialist gynaecologist) 
* You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the 
XY genotype, Turner s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
* You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. </p>
<p>Contraception in men taking Myclausen 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the 
father takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precautionyou or 
your female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days 
after you stop taking Myclausen.  </p>
<p>If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative 
therapies. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about 
the risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant 
organ if: 
* You plan to become pregnant. 
* You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
* You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking Myclausen until you see him or her. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - 27%) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, 
of face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat 
with the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the 
spine are not properly developed).Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor 
may request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take Myclausen if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can 
pass into the mother s milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Myclausen has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines 
until you feel better. </p>
<p>Myclausen contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Talk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects   you 
may need urgent medical treatment: 
* you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
* you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
* you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may 
be having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). </p>
<p>Usual problems 
Some of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection 
and vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in 
* the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. </p>
<p>Children may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, 
fewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. </p>
<p>Fighting infections 
Myclausen reduces your body s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, 
your body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more 
infections than usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and 
urinary system. </p>
<p>Lymph and skin cancer 
As can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of 
patients on Myclausen have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin. </p>
<p>General unwanted effects 
You may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic 
reactions (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such 
as stomach, chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling. </p>
<p>Other unwanted effects may include: </p>
<p>Skin problems such as: 
* acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth, hair loss, rash, itching. </p>
<p>Urinary problems such as: 
* blood in the urine. </p>
<p>Digestive system and mouth problems such as: 
* swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers 
* inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach 
* gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding 
* liver disorders 
* diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. </p>
<p>Nervous system problems such as: 
* feeling dizzy, drowsy or numb 
* tremor, muscle spasms, convulsions 
* feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. </p>
<p>Heart and blood vessel problems such as: 
* change in blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat, widening of blood vessels. </p>
<p>Lung problems such as: 
* pneumonia, bronchitis 
* shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung 
airways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor 
if you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness 
* fluid on the lungs or inside the chest 
* sinus problems. </p>
<p>Other problems such as: 
* weight loss, gout, high blood sugar, bleeding, bruising. </p>
