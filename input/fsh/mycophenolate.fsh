Mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, 
you must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the 
contraception advice given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of 
mycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before 
you take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and 
precautions” and “Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding”. </p>
<p>Do not take Mycophenolate mofetil Teva, 
• if you are allergic to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
• if you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test 
before your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. 
• if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant. 
• if you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). 
• if you are breast-feeding. 
Do not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with Mycophenolate mofetil Teva: 
• if you are older than 65 years as you may have an increased risk of developing adverse events such 
as certain viral infections, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary oedema when compared to 
younger patients. 
• if you experience any evidence of infection (e.g. fever, sore throat), unexpected bruising and/or 
bleeding. 
• if you have or ever have had any problems with your digestive system, e.g. stomach ulcers. 
• if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are taking 
Mycophenolate mofetil Teva. 
• if you have a hereditary enzyme deficiency such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. </p>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil Teva reduces your body’s defence mechanism. Because of this, there is an 
increased risk of skin cancer. Therefore you should limit your exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet 
(UV) light by wearing appropriate protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection 
factor. </p>
<p>You must not donate blood during treatment with Mycophenolate mofetil Teva and for at least 
6 weeks after stopping treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with Mycophenolate 
mofetil Teva and for at least 90 days after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Mycophenolate mofetil Teva is used in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) to prevent a body 
rejecting a transplanted kidney. 
Mycophenolate mofetil Teva should not be used in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) for heart or 
liver transplantation. 
Mycophenolate mofetil Teva should not be used at all in children under 2 years because based on the 
limited safety and efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Mycophenolate mofetil Teva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If you answer yes to any of the following questions talk to your doctor before you start to take 
Mycophenolate mofetil Teva: 
• Are you taking any medicines containing: 
o azathioprine or other immunosuppressive agents (which are sometimes given to patients after a 
transplant operation), 
o cholestyramine (used to treat patients with high blood cholesterol), 
o rifampicin (antibiotic), 
o antacids or proton pump inhibitors (used for acid problem in your stomach such as indigestion), 
o phosphate binders (used in patients with chronic kidney failure to reduce the absorption of 
phosphate), 
o antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections), 
o isavuconazole (used to treat fungal infections), 
o telmisartan (used to treat high blood pressure) 
o or any other medicines (including those you can buy without a prescription) that your doctor 
does not know about? 
• Do you need to have a vaccination (live vaccines)? Your doctor will have to advise you what is 
indicated for you. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Contraception in women taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use an effective method of contraception 
with Mycophenolate mofetil Teva. This includes: 
• Before you start taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva 
• During your entire treatment with Mycophenolate mofetil Teva 
• For 6 weeks after you stop taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva. 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended 
pregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not 
have been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. </p>
<p>You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
• You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago 
(if your periods have stopped because you have treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance you 
could become pregnant). 
• Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy). 
• Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy). 
• Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist 
gynaecologist). 
• You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY 
genotype, Turner`s syndrome or uterine agenesis. 
• You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. </p>
<p>Contraception in men taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the 
father takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or 
your female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days 
after you stop taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva. </p>
<p>If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative 
therapies. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about 
the risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant 
organ if: 
• You plan to become pregnant. 
• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
• You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva until you see him or her. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects 
(23-27%) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of 
eyes, of face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the 
throat with the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of 
the spine are not properly developed)).Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor 
may request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not take Mycophenolate mofetil Teva if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of 
the medicine can pass into the mother’s milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Mycophenolate mofetil Teva has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or 
machines. If you feel drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use 
any tools or machines until you feel better. </p>
<p>Mycophenolate mofetil Teva contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Your treatment is started and monitored by a doctor who is specialised in transplants. </p>
<p>The usual way to take Mycophenolate mofetil Teva is as follows: </p>
<p>Kidney Transplant </p>
<p>Adults 
The first dose will be given within 72 hours after the transplant operation. The recommended daily 
dose is 8 capsules (2 g of the active ingredient) taken as 2 separate doses. This means taking 4 
capsules in the morning then 4 capsules in the evening. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (aged 2 to 18) 
The dose given will vary depending on the size of the child. Your doctor will decide the most 
appropriate dose based on body surface area (height and weight). The recommended dose is 
600 mg/m2 taken twice a day. </p>
<p>Heart Transplant </p>
<p>Adults 
The first dose will be given within 5 days following the transplant operation. The recommended daily 
dose is 12 capsules (3 g of the active ingredient) taken as 2 separate doses. This means taking 6 
capsules in the morning then 6 capsules in the evening. </p>
<p>Children 
There is no information for the use of Mycophenolate mofetil Teva in children with a heart transplant. </p>
<p>Liver Transplant </p>
<p>Adults 
The first dose of oral Mycophenolate mofetil Teva will be given to you at least 4 days after the 
transplant operation and when you are able to swallow oral medicines. The recommended daily dose is 
12 capsules (3 g of the active ingredient) taken as 2 separate doses. This means taking 6 capsules in 
the morning then 6 capsules in the evening. </p>
<p>Children 
There is no information for the use of Mycophenolate mofetil Teva in children with a liver transplant. </p>
<p>Method and route of administration 
Swallow your capsules whole with a glass of water. You can take them with or without food. Do not 
break or crush them and do not take any capsules that have broken open or split. Avoid contact with 
any powder that spills out from damaged capsules. If a capsule breaks open accidentally, wash any 
powder from your skin with soap and water. If any powder gets into your eyes or mouth, rinse 
thoroughly with plenty of plain, fresh water. </p>
<p>Treatment will continue for you as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent rejection of your 
transplanted organ. </p>
<p>If you take more Mycophenolate mofetil Teva than you should 
It is important not to take too many capsules. Contact your nearest hospital Accident and Emergency 
department or a doctor for advice if you have swallowed more capsules than you have been told to 
take or if you think a child has swallowed any. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Mycophenolate mofetil Teva 
If you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember, then continue to take 
it at the usual times. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva 
Do not stop taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva because you feel better. It is important to take the 
medicine for as long as the doctor has told you to. Stopping your treatment with Mycophenolate 
mofetil Teva may increase the chance of rejection of your transplanted organ. Do not stop taking your 
medicine unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
