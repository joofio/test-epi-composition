before having Myocet liposomal. </p>
<p>Warning and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before having Myocet liposomal.  </p>
<p>Check with your doctor or nurse before having your medicine if:

Your doctor will do tests during your treatment to check that the medicine is working properly. They 
will also look out for any side effects such as blood problems or heart problems. </p>
<p>Radiation therapy 
If you have already had radiation therapy, this may react with Myocet liposomal. You may get painful, 
red or dry skin. This can happen straight away or later on in your treatment.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Myocet liposomal 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Myocet liposomal can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines 
can affect the way Myocet liposomal works. </p>
<p>In particular tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* phenobarbital or phenytoin – for epilepsy 
* warfarin – for thinning the blood 
* streptozotocin – for cancer of the pancreas

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before having Myocet liposomal.<br />
<em> Myocet liposomal should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.<br />
</em> Women having Myocet liposomal should not breast-feed.<br />
* Women who could get pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment with Myocet 
liposomal and for 6.5 months after treatment. 
* Women desiring to have children following completion of therapy are recommended to obtain 
genetic counselling and advice on fertility preservation before treatment. </p>

You may feel dizzy after having Myocet liposomal. If you feel dizzy or are not sure how you feel, do 
not drive or use any tools or machines. </p>

Myocet liposomal is available in cartons containing 1 set or 2 sets of 3 vials (not all pack-sizes may be 
marketed). When the 3 vials have been mixed together, your medicine contains about 108 mg sodium 
(main component of cooking/table salt). This is equivalent to 5.4 % of the recommended maximum 
daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much you will be given 
Your doctor will work out exactly how much you need. This is based on the size of your body 
(measured in “square metres” or “m2”). </p>
<p>The recommended dose is between 60 and 75 mg of the medicine for each square meter of your body: 
* this is given once every 3 weeks 
* the medicine “cyclophosphamide” is given on the same day. 
The doctor may give you a lower dose if they think you need it. </p>
<p>The number of times you have the drip depends on: 
* the stage of your breast cancer 
* how well your body responds to the medicine. 
Treatment usually lasts for about 3 to 6 months. </p>
<p>If you get Myocet liposomal on your skin 
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if any medicine leaks from the drip (infusion) onto your skin. 
This is because Myocet liposomal can damage your skin. The drip will be stopped straight away. Ice 
will be put on the affected area for 30 minutes. Then the drip will be started in another vein. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
