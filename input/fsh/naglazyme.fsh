  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Naglazyme is used to treat patients with MPS VI disease (Mucopolysaccharidosis VI).  </p>
<p>People with MPS VI disease have either a low level, or no level, of an enzyme called 
N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase, which breaks down specific substances (glycosaminoglycans) in 
the body. As a result, these substances do not get broken down and processed by the body as they 
should. They accumulate in many tissues in the body, which causes the symptoms of MPS VI. </p>
<p>How this medicine works </p>
<p>This medicine contains a recombinant enzyme called galsulfase. This can replace the natural enzyme 
which is lacking in MPS VI patients.  Treatment has been shown to improve walking and stair-
climbing ability, and to reduce the levels of glycosaminoglycans in the body.  This medicine may 
improve the symptoms of MPS VI. </p>         </div>"""

- If you have experienced severe or life-threatening allergic (hypersensitive) reactions to 
galsulfase or any of the other ingredients of Naglazyme and re-administration of the medicine 
was not successful.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
- If you are treated with Naglazyme, you may develop infusion-associated reactions. An infusion 
associated reaction is any side effect occurring during the infusion or until the end of the 
infusion day (see section 4  Possible Side Effects ). When you experience such a reaction, you 
should immediately contact your doctor.<br />
-<br />
If you have an allergic reaction your doctor may slow down, or stop, your infusion.  Your doctor 
may also give you additional medicines to manage any allergic reactions.<br />
- If you have a fever, or if you are having difficulty breathing before this medicine is given, talk 
with your doctor about delaying your Naglazyme infusion. 
- If you have an underlying heart condition, please inform your doctor at any point while being 
treated with Naglazyme. They may adjust your infusion based on this information. 
-<br />
This medicine has not been tested in patients with kidney or liver problems. Talk to your doctor 
if you have kidney or liver insufficiency. 
- Please talk to your doctor if you experience muscle pain, numbness in your arms or legs, or any 
bowel or bladder problems as these may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Naglazyme 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Naglazyme should not be given during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  It is not known whether galsulfase is excreted in 
milk, therefore breast-feeding should be stopped during Naglazyme treatment. Ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. </p>
<p>This medicine contains Sodium 
Each 5 ml vial contains 0.8 mmol (18.4 mg) of sodium and is administered in sodium chloride 9 
mg/ml solution for injection. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""
