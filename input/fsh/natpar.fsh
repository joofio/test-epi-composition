Natpar is a hormone replacement for adults with under-active parathyroid glands, a condition known 
as  hypoparathyroidism .
Hypoparathyroidism is a disease caused by low levels of parathyroid hormone, which is produced by 
the parathyroid glands in the neck. This hormone controls the amount of calcium and phosphate in the 
blood and urine.
If your levels of parathyroid hormone are too low, you can have low blood calcium. Low calcium can 
cause symptoms in many parts of your body, including the bones, heart, skin, muscles, kidneys, brain 
and nerves. For a list of symptoms of low calcium, see section 4. Natpar is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone that helps you keep calcium and phosphate levels in 
your blood and urine at a normal level.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6)
-
if you are having or have had radiation therapy to the skeleton
-
if you have cancer of the bones or other cancer that has spread to your bones
-
if you are at increased risk of developing a bone cancer called osteosarcoma (for instance, if you 
have Paget s disease or other bone diseases)
-
if a blood test shows you have unexplained increases in bone alkaline phosphatase
-
if you have pseudohypoparathyroidism, a rare condition where the body does not respond 
adequately to the parathyroid hormone produced by the body
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Natpar.
If you are treated with Natpar, you may have side effects related to low or high levels of calcium in 
your blood (see section 4 for these side effects).
These effects are more likely to occur:
-
when first starting Natpar,
-
if you change your Natpar dose,
-
if you miss one of your daily injections,
-
if you stop taking Natpar for a short time or altogether.
You may be given medicines to treat or help prevent these side effects, or you may be asked to stop 
some of the medicines you are taking. These medicines include calcium or vitamin D.
If your symptoms are severe, your doctor may give you additional medical treatment.
Your doctor will check your calcium levels. You may need to change your Natpar dose or stop the
injections for a short time.
Tests and checks
Your doctor will check how you respond to the treatment:
-
during the first 7 days of starting treatment and
-
if your dose is changed.
This will be done using tests to measure the level of calcium in your blood or urine. Your doctor may 
tell you to change the amount of calcium or vitamin D you take (in any form, including foods rich in 
calcium).
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Natpar if you suffer from kidney stones.
Children and adolescents
Natpar should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years old.
Other medicines and Natpar
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including:
-
digoxin, also known as digitalis, a heart medicine
-
medicines used to treat osteoporosis, called bisphosphonates, such as alendronic acid
-
medicines that can affect calcium levels in your blood such as lithium or some medicines used 
to increase the amount of urine (diuretics).
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. There is limited information on the 
safety of Natpar in pregnant women. Natpar has been shown to pass into breast milk in rats, but it is 
not known if Natpar would pass into breast milk in humans.
Your doctor will decide whether to start treatment with Natpar. Your doctor will also decide if you 
should keep taking this medicine if you become pregnant or start breast-feeding while taking it.
It is not known if Natpar has any effects on fertility.
Driving and using machines
Natpar has no effect on your being able to drive or use machines. However, hypoparathyroidism itself 
may affect your ability to concentrate. If your ability to concentrate is impaired, you should not drive 
or use machines until your ability to concentrate is improved.
Natpar contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor or nurse will train you on how to use the Natpar pen.
Natpar is given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection every day, using a pen to help you inject 
your medicine.
The  Natpar reusable pen  is called  Natpar pen  or  pen  in this leaflet.
Dose
The recommended starting dose of Natpar is 50 micrograms per day.
-
However, your doctor may start you on 25 micrograms per day based on a blood test result.
-
After 2 to 4 weeks, your doctor may adjust the dose.
The dose of Natpar varies from person to person. People may need between 25 and100 micrograms of 
Natpar per day.
Your doctor may tell you to take other medicines such as calcium supplements or vitamin D while you 
are taking Natpar. Your doctor will tell you how much you should take each day.
How to use the pen
Read  Section 7. Instructions for use  in this leaflet before you use the pen.
Do not use the pen if the solution is cloudy or coloured or if it contains visible particles.
Before the pen is used for the first time, the medicine has to be mixed.
After you have mixed the medicine, the Natpar pen is ready for use and the medicine can be injected 
under the skin of your thigh. Inject in the other thigh the following day and continue to alternate 
between the two.
It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Natpar, the name and batch number 
of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used.
How long to use
Keep using Natpar for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you.
If you use more Natpar than you should
If, by mistake, you inject more than one dose of Natpar in a day, contact your doctor or pharmacist
immediately.
If you forget to use Natpar
If you forget to use Natpar (or cannot inject it at your usual time), use your injection as soon as you 
can but do not inject more than one dose in the same day.
Take your next dose of Natpar at the usual time the next day. You may need to take more calcium 
supplements if you have signs of low blood calcium; see section 4 for symptoms.
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Natpar
Discuss with your doctor if you want to stop treatment with Natpar.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
