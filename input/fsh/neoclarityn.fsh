Neoclarityn contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine. </p>
<p>How Neoclarityn works 
Neoclarityn is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your allergic 
reaction and its symptoms. </p>
<p>When Neoclarityn should be used 
Neoclarityn relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages 
caused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults and adolescents 
12 years of age and older. These symptoms include sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy palate, and 
itchy, red or watery eyes.  </p>
<p>Neoclarityn is also used to relieve the symptoms associated with urticaria (a skin condition caused by 
an allergy). These symptoms include itching and hives. </p>
<p>Relief of these symptoms lasts a full day and helps you to resume your normal daily activities and 
sleep. </p>         </div>"""
