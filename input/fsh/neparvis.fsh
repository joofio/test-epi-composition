* if you are allergic to sacubitril, valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6). 
* if you are taking another type of medicine called an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril), which is used to treat high blood 
pressure or heart failure. If you have been taking an ACE inhibitor, wait for 36 hours after 
taking the last dose before you start to take Neparvis (see  Other medicines and Neparvis ). 
* if you have ever had a reaction called angioedema (rapid swelling under the skin in areas such 
as the face, throat, arms and legs which can be life threatening if throat swelling blocks the 
airway) when taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (such as 
valsartan, telmisartan or irbesartan). 
* if you have a history of angioedema which is hereditary or for which the cause is unknown 
(idiopathic). 
* if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are being treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren (see  Other medicines and Neparvis ). 
* if you have severe liver disease. 
* if you are more than 3 months pregnant (see  Pregnancy and breast-feeding ). 
If any of the above applies to you, do not take Neparvis and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or when taking Neparvis: 
* if you are being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or aliskiren (see  Do not 
take Neparvis ). 
* if you have ever had angioedema (see  Do not take Neparvis  and section 4  Possible side 
effects ). 
* if you have low blood pressure or are taking any other medicines that reduce your blood 
pressure (for example, a medicine that increases urine production (diuretic)) or are suffering 
from vomiting or diarrhoea, especially if you are aged 65 years or more, or if you have kidney 
disease and low blood pressure. 
* if you have kidney disease. 
* if you are suffering from dehydration. 
* if your kidney artery has narrowed. 
* if you have liver disease. 
* if you experience hallucinations, paranoia or changes in sleeping pattern while taking Neparvis. 
* if you have hyperkalaemia (high levels of potassium in the blood). 
* if you suffer from heart failure classified as NYHA class IV (unable to carry on any physical 
activity without discomfort and may have symptoms even when resting). </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you take 
Neparvis. </p>
<p>Your doctor may check the amount of potassium and sodium in your blood at regular intervals during 
Neparvis treatment. In addition, your doctor may check your blood pressure at start of treatment and 
when the doses are increased. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children aged below 1 year because it has not been studied in this age 
group. For children one year and older with a body weight below 40 kg, this medicine will be given as 
granules (instead of tablets). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Neparvis 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. It may be necessary to change the dose, to take other precautions, or even to stop taking 
one of the medicines. This is particularly important for the following medicines: 
* ACE inhibitors. Do not take Neparvis with ACE inhibitors. If you have been taking an ACE 
inhibitor, wait 36 hours after taking the last dose of the ACE inhibitor before starting to take 
Neparvis (see  Do not take Neparvis ). If you stop taking Neparvis, wait 36 hours after taking 
your last dose of Neparvis before starting an ACE inhibitor. 
* other medicines used to treat heart failure or lower blood pressure, such as angiotensin receptor 
blockers or aliskiren (see  Do not take Neparvis ). 
* some medicines known as statins that are used to lower high cholesterol levels (for example 
atorvastatin). 
* sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil or avanafil, which are medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction 
or lung hypertension. 
* medicines that increase the amount of potassium in the blood. These include potassium 
supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing medicines and heparin. 
* painkillers of the type called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or selective 
cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitors. If you are taking one of these, your doctor may want to 
check your kidney function when starting or adjusting treatment (see  Warnings and 
precautions ). 
* lithium, a medicine used to treat some types of psychiatric illness. 
* furosemide, a medicine belonging to the type known as diuretics, which are used to increase the 
amount of urine you produce. 
* nitroglycerine, a medicine used to treat angina pectoris. 
* some types of antibiotics (rifamycin group), ciclosporin (used to prevent rejection of 
transplanted organs) or antivirals such as ritonavir (used to treat HIV/AIDS). 
* metformin, a medicine used to treat diabetes. 
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before you take Neparvis. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will 
normally advise you to stop taking this medicine before you become pregnant or as soon as you know 
you are pregnant, and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Neparvis. </p>
<p>This medicine is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 
3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after the third month of 
pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Neparvis is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding. Tell your doctor if you are 
breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Before you drive a vehicle, use tools or operate machines, or carry out other activities that require 
concentration, make sure you know how Neparvis affects you. If you feel dizzy or very tired while 
taking this medicine, do not drive a vehicle, cycle or use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Neparvis contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 97 mg/103 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially  sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Adults 
You will usually start by taking a 24 mg/26 mg or 49 mg/51 mg tablet twice a day (one tablet in the 
morning and one tablet in the evening). Your doctor will decide your exact starting dose based on 
which medicines you have been taking previously and your blood pressure. Your doctor will then 
adjust the dose every 2-4 weeks depending on how you respond to the treatment until the best dose for 
you is found. </p>
<p>The usual recommended target dose is 97 mg/103 mg twice a day (one tablet in the morning and one 
tablet in the evening). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (one year and older) 
Your (or your child s) doctor will decide the starting dose based on body weight and other factors 
including previously taken medicines. The doctor will adjust the dose every 2-4 weeks until the best 
dose is found. </p>
<p>Neparvis should be given twice a day (one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening). </p>
<p>Neparvis film-coated tablets are not meant to be used in children who weigh less than 40 kg. For these 
patients, Neparvis granules are available. </p>
<p>Patients taking Neparvis can develop low blood pressure (dizziness, light-headedness), a high level of 
potassium in the blood (which would be detected when your doctor performed a blood test) or 
decreased kidney function. If this happens, your doctor may reduce the dose of any other medicine you 
are taking, temporarily reduce the Neparvis dose, or stop Neparvis treatment completely. </p>
<p>Swallow the tablets with a glass of water. You can take Neparvis with or without food. Splitting or 
crushing of the tablets is not recommended. </p>
<p>If you take more Neparvis than you should 
If you have accidentally taken too many Neparvis tablets, or if someone else has taken your tablets, 
contact your doctor immediately. If you experience severe dizziness and/or fainting, tell your doctor as 
quickly as possible and lie down. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Neparvis 
It is advisable to take your medicine at the same time each day. However, if you forget to take a dose, 
you should simply take the next one at the scheduled time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Neparvis 
Stopping your treatment with Neparvis may cause your condition to get worse. Do not stop taking 
your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
