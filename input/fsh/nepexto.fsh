<p>Nepexto is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein 
in the body that causes inflammation. This medicine works by reducing the inflammation associated 
with certain diseases. </p>
<p>In adults (aged 18 and over), Nepexto can be used for: 
* moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis (long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects 
joints); 
* psoriatic arthritis (a type of inflammatory arthritis which can affect any joint in the body); 
* severe axial spondyloarthritis (a type of chronic inflammatory arthritis involving the spine 
and/or sacroiliac joints) including ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that affects the 
spine); 
* moderate or severe psoriasis (raised, red, scaly patches on the skin). 
In each case Nepexto is used, usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough 
or are not suitable for you. </p>
<p>For rheumatoid arthritis, this medicine is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it 
may also be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in 
combination with methotrexate, Nepexto can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the 
rheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. 
For psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, this medicine can improve your 
ability to do normal daily activities. </p>
<p>For patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), this 
medicine can slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease. </p>
<p>Nepexto is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents. </p>
<ul>
<li>For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not 
worked well enough or is not suitable for them: </li>
</ul>
<p>Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in 
patients from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more 
when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who have had 
an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. </p>

* if you or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients 
of Nepexto (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest 
tightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Nepexto, and contact your doctor 
immediately. 
* if you or the child have or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If 
you are not sure, please contact your doctor; 
* if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Nepexto. </p>
<ul>
<li>Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, 
wheezing, dizziness or rash, stop using this medicine, and contact your doctor immediately. </li>
<li>Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major 
surgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with this medicine. </li>
<li>Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or 
suffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. </li>
<li>Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If 
you or the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, tell your 
doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the 
presence of infections after you stop using Nepexto. </li>
<li>Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Nepexto, 
your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting treatment with 
this medicine. This may include a thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. 
The conduct of these tests should be recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you 
tell your doctor if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis or have been in close contact with 
someone who has had tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, 
weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell 
your doctor immediately. </li>
<li>Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor 
should test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with 
this medicine. Treatment with Nepexto may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who 
have previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using 
this medicine. </li>
<li>Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to 
monitor the treatment with this medicine in case the infection worsens. </li>
<li>Blood disorders: Tell your doctor immediately if you or the child have any signs or symptoms 
such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms may point to 
the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require discontinuation 
of Nepexto. </li>
<li>Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, 
optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of 
the spinal cord). Your doctor will determine if using this medicine is an appropriate treatment. </li>
<li>Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart 
failure (when your heart muscle doesn t pump blood as well as it should), because this medicine 
needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. </li>
<li>Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or 
any other cancer before you use this medicine. Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who 
have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher than average risk of developing 
lymphoma. Children and adults using this medicine may have an increased risk of developing 
lymphoma or another cancer. Some children and teenage patients who have received etanercept 
or other medicines that work the same way as etanercept have developed cancers, including 
unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. Some patients receiving Nepexto have 
developed skin cancer. Tell your doctor if you or the child develop any change in the 
appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. </li>
<li>Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using this 
medicine. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. </li>
<li>Alcohol abuse: Do not use this medicine for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. 
Tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. </li>
<li>Wegener s granulomatosis: this medicine is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener s 
granulomatosis (a rare inflammatory disease). Tell your doctor if you or the child in your care 
have Wegener s granulomatosis. </li>
<li>Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking 
medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic 
medicine while using this medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
Nepexto. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using this 
medicine. Tell your doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Nepexto should not be used in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg. </p>
<p>Nepexto should not be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below the age of 
2 years, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis below the age of 12 years, or 
in children with psoriasis below the age of 6 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nepexto </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking or have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines (including sulfasalazine), including those not prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>You or the child should not use Nepexto with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or 
abatacept. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Nepexto should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if 
you become pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. </p>
<p>If you received Nepexto during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. 
In addition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, 
compared with mothers who had not received this medicine or other similar medicines (TNF- antagonists), but there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no 
increased risk of birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will 
help you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you want to breastfeed while on Enbrel treatment. It is important that you tell 
your baby s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Enbrel during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding before your baby receives any vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>The use of Nepexto is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Nepexto contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say, essentially  sodium- free . </p>         </div>"""
