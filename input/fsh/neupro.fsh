which is important for movement. </p>
<p>What Neupro is used for<br />
Neupro is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of: 
* Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)   this can be associated with discomfort in your legs or arms, 
urges to move around, sleep disturbance and feeling tired or sleepy during the day. These 
symptoms are either reduced or their duration is shortened with Neupro treatment. </p>         </div>"""

* you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
* you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside 
of the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy) 
* you need  cardioversion  (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat). </p>
<p>You must take your Neupro patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
cardioversion to avoid skin burns  because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on 
afterwards.  </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you, do not use Neupro. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor 
or pharmacist or nurse first. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before using Neupro. This is because: 
* your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Neupro, especially at the start of the 
treatment. Neupro may affect your blood pressure. 
* your eyes need checking regularly while using Neupro. If you notice any problems with your 
eyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. 
* if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver 
problems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. 
* you may get skin problems caused by the patch   see  Skin problems caused by the patch  in 
section 4. * you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly   see  Driving and using machines  in 
section 2. * your symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome may start earlier than usual, be more intense and 
involve other limbs. If you experience such symptoms either before or after beginning treatment 
with Neupro, contact your doctor as your treatment may need to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Medicines used to treat Restless Legs Syndrome should be reduced or stopped gradually. Tell your 
doctor if after stopping or reducing your Neupro treatment you experience symptoms such as 
depression, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. </p>
<p>Loss of consciousness can occur 
Neupro can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Neupro or 
when your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. </p>
<p>Changes in behaviour and abnormal thinking 
Neupro can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to 
tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. 
This is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes 
in your behaviour. Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are using the drug 
excessively or developing craving for large doses of Neupro or other medicines used to treat Restless 
Legs Syndrome. </p>
<p>See  Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking  in section 4 for more information. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or 
effective in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Neupro 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Do not take the following medicines while using Neupro   because they may decrease its effect:<br />
<em>  anti-psychotic  medicines   used to treat certain mental illnesses<br />
</em> metoclopramide   used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Neupro if you are taking: 
* sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or 
depression. 
* medicines that lower blood pressure. Neupro may decrease blood pressure when you stand up <br />
this effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Neupro. </p>
<p>Neupro with food, drink and alcohol 
Because rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way 
this medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to 
drink alcohol while using Neupro. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Neupro if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the 
unborn baby are not known.  </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Neupro. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast 
milk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Neupro may make you feel very sleepy and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not 
drive. In isolated cases, people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. </p>
<p>Also do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy   or do anything else which may put others 
or yourself at risk of serious injury. </p>
<p>Neupro contains sodium metabisulphite (E223) 
Sodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and 
bronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). </p>         </div>"""

<em> Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.<br />
</em> Change the patches at about the same time every day. 
* Do not cut the Neupro patches into pieces. </p>
<p>Where to stick the patch 
Put the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, 
healthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on 
the pictures opposite:<br />
* Shoulder or upper arm. 
* Belly. 
* Flank (your side, between the ribs 
and hips). 
* Thigh or hip. </p>
<p>To avoid skin irritation </p>
<ul>
<li>Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For 
example, put it on the right side of your body one day, then 
on the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper 
body one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  </li>
<li>Do not stick Neupro on the same area of skin twice 
within 14 days. </li>
<li>Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin   or on 
skin that is red or irritated. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see  Skin problems caused by 
the patch  in section 4 for more information. </p>
<p>To prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off 
* Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. 
* Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. 
Also do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.<br />
* If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days 
before sticking the patch there. 
* If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. </p>
<p>If the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day   then replace the patch at the usual 
time. </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not let the area of the patch get hot   for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, 
heating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you 
think that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. </li>
<li>Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or 
exercising. </li>
<li>If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is 
because it may change the colour of the skin. </li>
</ul>
<p>How to use the patch 
* Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.<br />
* Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you 
have removed any old patch. 
* Stick the Neupro patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the 
release liner. </p>

</ol>
<p>How to take off a used patch 
* Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. 
* Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays 
on your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. 
* Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids   such as nail polish remover. These may irritate 
your skin. </p>
<p>If you use more Neupro than you should 
Using higher doses of Neupro than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling 
sick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real 
(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions.<br />
In such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. </p>
<p>If you forget to change the patch at your usual time 
* If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. 
Take off the old patch and use a new one.<br />
* If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as 
soon as you remember.  </p>
<p>In both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Neupro 
Do not stop using Neupro without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical 
condition called  neuroleptic malignant syndrome  which could be life-threatening. The signs include: 
loss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate 
(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  </p>
<p>If your doctor says you should stop Neupro, the daily dose should be lowered gradually: 
* Restless Legs Syndrome   lowered by 1 mg every other day. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
