<p>This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. </p>
<p>Neuraceq contains the active substance florbetaben (18F).  </p>
<p>Neuraceq is given to people with memory problems so that doctors can perform a type of brain scan, 
called a PET scan. A Neuraceq PET scan, along with other brain function tests, can help your doctor 
determine whether or not you may have β-amyloid plaques in your brain. This medicine is intended 
for adults only.  </p>
<p>You should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. </p>
<p>The use of Neuraceq does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of this procedure with the 
radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to radiation. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Neuraceq must not be used: 
- if you are allergic to florbetaben (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Neuraceq if you: 
have kidney problems 
- have liver problems 
- are pregnant or think you may be pregnant<br />
- are breast-feeding </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Neuraceq is not intended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Neuraceq 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images from the PET scan. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your nuclear medicine doctor for advise before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Neuraceq if there is a possibility 
you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. When in doubt, it 
is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  </p>
<p>Pregnant 
The nuclear medicine doctor will only give this medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected 
which would outweigh the risks.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You must stop breast-feeding for 24 hours after the injection. Express breast milk during this period 
and discard the breast milk you have expressed. Resuming breast-feeding should be in agreement with 
the nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Neuraceq has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Neuraceq contains ethanol and sodium ascorbate 
- This medicine contains up to 1200 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each dose, which is equivalent 
to 17 mg/kg. The amount per dose of this medicine is equivalent to 30 ml beer or 12.5 ml 
wine. </p>
<p>The amount of alcohol in this medicine is not likely to have an effect in adults and 
adolescents, and its effects in children are not likely to be noticeable. It may have some effects 
in younger children, for example feeling sleepy. </p>
<p>The alcohol in this medicine may alter the effects of other medicines. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are taking other medicines. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this 
medicine. </p>
<p>If you are addicted to alcohol, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>This medicine contains up to 33 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
dose. This is equivalent to 1.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium 
for an adult. </li>

<p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products.<br />
Neuraceq will only be used in specially controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given 
to you by professionals who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special 
care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions. </p>
<p>Dose 
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of Neuraceq to be 
used in your case. It will be the smallest amount necessary to get the desired information. </p>
<p>The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult is 300 MBq (megabecquerel, the 
unit used to express radioactivity). </p>
<p>Administration of Neuraceq and conduct of the procedure 
Neuraceq is given as an injection into your vein (intravenous injection) followed by a flush of sodium 
chloride solution to ensure full delivery of the dose.  </p>
<p>One injection is sufficient to carry out the scan that your doctor needs. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
A brain scan is usually taken 90 minutes after Neuraceq is given.<br />
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure.  </p>
<p>After administration of Neuraceq, you should: 
Avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for 24 hours following the 
injection. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more Neuraceq than you should 
An overdose is unlikely since you will only receive a single dose of Neuraceq precisely controlled by 
the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure.  </p>
<p>However, in the case of an overdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. In particular, the 
nuclear medicine doctor in charge of the procedure may provide ways to increase the passing of urine 
and stools in order to help remove radioactivity from your body. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""
