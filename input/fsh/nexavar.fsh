Nexavar is used to treat thyroid cancer (differentiated thyroid carcinoma). </p>
<p>Nexavar is a so-called multikinase inhibitor. It works by slowing down the rate of growth of cancer 
cells and cutting off the blood supply that keeps cancer cells growing.  </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to sorafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nexavar. </p>
<p>Take special care with Nexavar 
- If you experience skin problems. Nexavar can cause rashes and skin reactions, especially on the 
hands and feet. These can usually be treated by your doctor. If not, your doctor may interrupt 
treatment or stop it altogether.<br />
- If you have high blood pressure. Nexavar can raise blood pressure, and your doctor will usually 
monitor your blood pressure and may give you a medicine to treat your high blood pressure.<br />
- If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. 
- If you have diabetes. Blood sugar levels in diabetic patients should be checked regularly in order 
to assess if anti-diabetic medicine’s dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of low blood 
sugar. 
- If you get any bleeding problems, or are taking warfarin or phenprocoumon. Treatment with 
Nexavar may lead to a higher risk of bleeding. If you are taking warfarin or phenprocoumon, 
medicines which thin the blood to prevent blood clots, there may be a greater risk of bleeding.<br />
- If you get chest pain or heart problems. Your doctor may decide to interrupt treatment or stop it 
altogether. 
- If you have a heart disorder, such as an abnormal electrical signal called "prolongation of the 
QT interval". 
- If you are going to have surgery, or if you had an operation recently. Nexavar might affect the 
way your wounds heal. You will usually be taken off Nexavar if you are having an operation. 
Your doctor will decide when to start with Nexavar again. 
- If you are taking irinotecan or are given docetaxel, which are also medicines for cancer. 
Nexavar may increase the effects and, in particular, the side effects of these medicines. 
- If you are taking Neomycin or other antibiotics. The effect of Nexavar may be decreased. 
- If you have severe liver impairment. You may experience more severe side effects when taking 
this medicine. 
- If you have poor kidney function. Your doctor will monitor your fluid and electrolyte balance. 
- Fertility. Nexavar may reduce fertility in both men and women. If you are concerned, talk to a 
doctor.<br />
- Holes in the gut wall (gastrointestinal perforation) may occur during treatment (see section 4: 
Possible Side Effects). In this case your doctor will interrupt the treatment. 
- If you have thyroid cancer. Your doctor will monitor blood calcium and thyroid hormone levels. 
- If you experienced the following, contact your doctor immediately as this can be a life-
threatening condition: nausea, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, muscular cramps, seizure, 
clouding of urine and tiredness. These may be caused by a group of metabolic complications that 
can occur during treatment of cancer that are caused by the break-down products of dying cancer 
cells (Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)) and can lead to changes in kidney function and acute renal 
failure (see also section 4: Possible Side Effects). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these affect you. You may need treatment for them, or your doctor may 
decide to change your dose of Nexavar, or stop treatment altogether (see also section 4: Possible side 
effects). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents have not yet been tested with Nexavar.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nexavar 
Some medicines may affect Nexavar, or be affected by it. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
taking, have recently taken or might take anything in this list or any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription: 
- Rifampicin, Neomycin or other medicines used to treat infections (antibiotics) 
- St John’s wort, a herbal treatment for depression 
- Phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital, treatments for epilepsy and other conditions 
- Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used for various conditions 
- Warfarin or phenprocoumon, anticoagulants used to prevent blood clots 
- Doxorubicin, capecitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel and irinotecan, which are cancer treatments 
- Digoxin, a treatment for mild to moderate heart failure </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Nexavar. If you could become pregnant use 
adequate contraception during treatment. If you become pregnant while being treated with Nexavar, 
immediately tell your doctor who will decide if the treatment should be continued. </p>
<p>You must not breast-feed your baby during Nexavar treatment, as this medicine may interfere 
with the growth and development of your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
There is no evidence that Nexavar will affect the ability to drive or to operate machines. </p>
<p>Nexavar contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium 
free”. </p>         </div>"""

This is equivalent to a daily dose of 800 mg or four tablets a day.  </p>
<p>Swallow Nexavar tablets with a glass of water, either without food or with a low-fat or moderate fat 
meal. Do not take this medicine with high fat meals, as this may make Nexavar less effective. If you 
intend to have a high fat meal, take the tablets at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the meal. 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you to. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>It is important to take this medicine at about the same times each day, so that there is a steady amount 
in the bloodstream. </p>
<p>You will usually carry on taking this medicine as long as you are getting clinical benefits, and not 
suffering unacceptable side effects. </p>
<p>If you take more Nexavar than you should 
Tell your doctor straight away if you (or anyone else) have taken more than your prescribed dose. 
Taking too much Nexavar makes side effects more likely or more severe, especially diarrhoea and skin 
reactions. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Nexavar 
If you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is nearly time for the next dose, forget 
about the missed one and carry on as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten 
individual doses. </p>         </div>"""
