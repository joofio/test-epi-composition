<ul>
<li>if you or your child are allergic to bromelain </li>
<li>if you or your child are allergic to pineapples </li>
<li>if you or your child are allergic to papaya/papain </li>
<li>if you or your child are allergic to any of the other ingredients of the powder or gel (listed in section 
6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before NexoBrid is used if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you or your child have a heart disease; </li>
<li>you or your child have diabetes; </li>
<li>you or your child have an active peptic ulcer in the stomach, </li>
<li>you or your child have a vascular disease (with vascular occlusion); </li>
<li>you or your child have enlarged veins in the area close to the burn; </li>
<li>you or your child have implants or a pacemaker or a vascular shunt;  </li>
<li>you or your child have problems with bleeding or if you or your child take blood-thinners; </li>
<li>your or your child's wound(s) came into contact with chemicals or other hazardous substances; </li>
<li>you or your child have a lung disease; </li>
<li>your or your child's lung has been, or may have been damaged by inhalation of smoke;  </li>
<li>you or your child are allergic to latex, bee stings, or olive tree pollen. If so, you or your child may 
also experience allergic reactions to NexoBrid. 
Allergic reactions can cause, for example, breathing difficulties, swelling of the skin, hives, other skin 
reactions, redness of the skin, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and abdominal discomfort, or a 
combination of such effects. If you or your child notice any of these signs or symptoms, inform your doctor 
or caregiver immediately. 
Allergic reactions can be severe and require medical treatment. 
In case of skin contact, rinse NexoBrid off with water. This is to make an allergic reaction to NexoBrid<br />
less likely. </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of NexoBrid to remove burnt tissue may lead to fever, to wound inflammation or wound infection, 
and possibly to general infection. You or your child may be checked regularly for these conditions and<br />
may receive medicines to prevent or treat infections. </p>
<p>NexoBrid may reduce the ability of the blood to form clots, which increases the risk of bleeding. NexoBrid 
should be used with caution if you or your child are treated with medicines that reduce the blood s ability 
to form clots (so-called blood-thinners) or if you or your child have a general tendency to bleed, a stomach 
ulcer, blood poisoning, or another condition that could cause you or your child to bleed. After treatment 
with NexoBrid your doctor may check blood coagulation levels. </p>
<p>Direct contact of NexoBrid with the eyes should be avoided. If NexoBrid goes into the eyes, wash them 
with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. </p>
<p>To prevent wound-healing problems, the treated burn wound will be covered as soon as possible by 
temporary or permanent skin substitutes or dressings. </p>
<p>NexoBrid should not be used in chemical burn wounds, electrical burns, foot burns in diabetic patients and 
patients with occlusive vascular disease, in contaminated wounds and wounds where NexoBrid could come 
in contact with foreign materials (for example, implants, pacemakers, and shunts) or large blood vessels, 
the eyes or other important body parts. NexoBrid should be used with caution in areas of varicose veins 
(enlarged twisted veins), to prevent risk of bleeding from them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NexoBrid 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor will be cautious and watch for signs of reduced blood coagulation or bleeding when 
prescribing other medicines that affect blood coagulation, because NexoBrid may reduce blood 
coagulation. </p>
<p>NexoBrid may:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase the effects of certain medicines that are inactivated by a liver enzyme called CYP2C8 and 
CYP2C9. This is because NexoBrid can be absorbed from the burn wound into the blood stream. </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of such medicines are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>amiodarone (used to treat certain forms of irregular heartbeat), </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>amodiaquine and chloroquine (used to treat malaria and some forms of inflammation), </p>
</li>
<li>fluvastatin (used to treat high cholesterol), </li>
<li>pioglitazone, repaglinide, tolbutamide and glipizide (used to treat diabetes),  </li>
<li>paclitaxel  (used to treat cancer),  </li>
<li>
<p>torasemide (used to increase urine flow), </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ibuprofen (used to treat fever, pain and some forms of inflammation),  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>losartan (used to treat high blood pressure),  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>celecoxib (used to treat some forms of inflammation),  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>warfarin (used to reduce blood coagulation), and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). </p>
</li>
<li>intensify your or your child s reaction to the cancer medicines fluorouracil and vincristine. </li>
<li>cause an unwanted drop in blood pressure when you or your child are treated with medicines called 
ACE inhibitors, which are used to treat high blood pressure and other conditions.  </li>
<li>increase drowsiness when used at the same time with medicines that can cause drowsiness. These 
medicines include, for example, sleep medications, so-called tranquilizers, some pain medications 
and antidepressants. </li>
<li>Silver sulfadiazine or povidone-iodine at the wound site may decrease the efficacy of the 
medicinalproduct. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure whether you or your child are taking any of the medicines mentioned above, ask your 
doctor before NexoBrid is used. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The use of NexoBrid during pregnancy is not recommended. 
As a precautionary measure, you should not breast-feed for at least 4 days after NexoBrid application. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, talk to 
your doctor or pharmacist before this medicine is used. </p>         </div>"""
