Nexviadyme contains an enzyme called avalglucosidase alfa   it is a copy of the natural enzyme called 
acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) that is lacking in people with Pompe disease. </p>
<p>What Nexviadyme is used for 
Nexviadyme is used to treat people of all ages who have Pompe disease.  </p>
<p>People with Pompe disease have low levels of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This 
enzyme helps control levels of glycogen (a type of carbohydrate) in the body. Glycogen provides the 
body with energy, but in Pompe disease high levels of glycogen build up in different muscles and 
damages them. The medicine replaces the missing enzyme so that the body can reduce the build-up of 
glycogen. </p>         </div>"""

and restarting the medicine.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before using Nexviadyme </p>
<p>Speak to your doctor immediately if treatment with Nexviadyme causes: 
* allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction)   see under  Possible side 
effects , below for symptoms 
* infusion-associated reaction while you are receiving the medicine or in the few hours afterwards 
  see under  Possible side effects , below for symptoms </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor if you have swelling in your legs or widespread swelling of your body. Your 
doctor will decide if your Nexviadyme infusion should stop and the doctor will give you appropriate 
medical treatment. Your doctor will also decide if you can continue receiving avalglucosidase alfa. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nexviadyme 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. There is no information about the use 
of Nexviadyme in pregnant women. You must not receive Nexviadyme during pregnancy unless your 
doctor specifically recommends it. You and your doctor should decide if you can use Nexviadyme if 
you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Nexviadyme may have a minor effect on the ability to drive and use machines. Because dizziness, low 
blood pressure and sleepiness can occur as infusion-associated reactions, this may affect the ability to 
drive and use machines on the day of the infusion. </p>         </div>"""
