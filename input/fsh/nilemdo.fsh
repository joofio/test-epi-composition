<p>Nilemdo is a medicine that lowers levels of  bad  cholesterol (also called  LDL-cholesterol ), a type 
of fat, in the blood. </p>
<p>Nilemdo contains the active substance bempedoic acid, which is inactive until it enters the liver where 
it is changed to its active form. Bempedoic acid decreases the production of cholesterol in the liver and 
increases the removal of LDL-cholesterol from the blood by blocking an enzyme (ATP citrate lyase) 
needed for the production of cholesterol. </p>
<p>What Nilemdo is used for </p>
<p>Nilemdo is given to adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia, which are 
conditions that cause a high cholesterol level in the blood. It is given in addition to a cholesterol-
lowering diet. </p>
<p>Nilemdo is given: 
* if you have been using a statin (such as simvastatin, a commonly used medicine that treats high 
cholesterol) and this does not lower your LDL-cholesterol sufficiently; 
* alone or together with other cholesterol-lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or 
cannot be used. </p>         </div>"""

section 6); </li>
<li>if you are pregnant; </li>
<li>if you are breast-feeding; </li>
<li>if you take more than 40 mg of simvastatin daily (another medicine used to lower cholesterol). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nilemdo: 
* if you ever had gout; 
* if you have severe kidney problems; 
* if you have severe liver problems. </p>
<p>Your doctor may do a blood test before you start taking Nilemdo. This is to check how well your liver 
is working. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give Nilemdo to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Nilemdo has not 
been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nilemdo </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking medicine(s) with any of the following active 
substances: 
* atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (used to lower 
cholesterol and known as statins). 
The risk of muscle disease may increase when taking both a statin and Nilemdo. Tell your 
doctor immediately about any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. 
* bosentan (used to manage a condition called pulmonary artery hypertension). 
* fimasartan (used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure). 
* asunaprevir, glecaprevir, grazoprevir, voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or think you may be pregnant, as 
there is a possibility that it could harm an unborn baby. If you get pregnant while taking this medicine, 
call your doctor immediately and stop taking Nilemdo. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy 
Before starting treatment, you should confirm you are not pregnant and are using effective 
contraception, as advised by your doctor. If you use contraceptive pills and suffer from an 
episode of diarrhoea or vomiting that lasts more than 2 days, you must use an alternative method 
of contraception (e.g. condoms, diaphragm) for 7 days following resolution of symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p>If, after you have started treatment with Nilemdo, you decide that you would like to become 
pregnant, tell your doctor, as your treatment will need to be changed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Breast-feeding 
Do not take Nilemdo if you are breast-feeding because it is not known if Nilemdo passes into 
milk. 
Driving and using machines </li>
</ul>
<p>Nilemdo has no or little influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Nilemdo contains lactose and sodium </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
