Nimenrix is a vaccine which helps protect against infections caused by bacteria (germs) called 
“Neisseria meningitidis" types A, C, W-135 and Y. 
“Neisseria meningitidis" types A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious illnesses such as: 
 meningitis - an infection of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. 
 septicaemia - an infection of the blood. 
These infections are passed easily from person to person and can cause death if not treated. 
Nimenrix may be given to adults, adolescents, children and infants over the age of 6 weeks. </p>
<p>How Nimenrix works 
Nimenrix helps your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. These 
antibodies help protect you against the diseases. </p>
<p>Nimenrix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria “Neisseria meningitidis” types A, 
C, W-135 and Y. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Nimenrix should not be given if: 
 
you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients in this vaccine (listed in 
section 6). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the 
face or tongue. See your doctor immediately if you notice any of these. 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Nimenrix. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions: 
Check with your doctor or nurse before you receive this vaccine if: 
 
you have an infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you, the 
vaccination will not be given until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold 
should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor or nurse first. 
 
you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive 
Nimenrix. </p>
<p>Nimenrix may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated. If you have a weak immune system (such 
as due to HIV infection or medicines that affect the immune system) you may not get a full benefit 
from Nimenrix. </p>
<p>Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nimenrix 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including other 
vaccines and medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Nimenrix may not work as well if you are taking medicines that affect your immune system. </p>
<p>In infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, inactivated 
poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib 
vaccine, and with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. </p>
<p>From age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: 
hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, 
measles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or 
unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. </p>
<p>In the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, 
inactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-
IPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. </p>
<p>In individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus 
vaccine [Types 16, 18] and a combined diphtheria (reduced antigen content), tetanus and acellular 
pertussis vaccine. </p>
<p>Whenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, 
should be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT 
containing vaccine. </p>
<p>A different injection site will be used for each vaccine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding, you 
must tell your doctor before receiving Nimenrix. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Nimenrix is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any 
machines if you are feeling unwell. </p>
<p>Nimenrix contains sodium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
