  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>The active substance of Nimvastid is rivastigmine.
Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with 
Alzheimer s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, 
resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to 
communicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down 
acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Nimvastid 
allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of 
Alzheimer s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson s disease.
Nimvastid is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer s 
dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and 
behaviour. The capsules and orodispersible tablets can also be used for the treatment of dementia in 
adult patients with Parkinson s disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Nimvastid) or to any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
-
if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local 
reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve 
within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch.
If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Nimvastid.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Nimvastid:
-
if you have, or have ever had, a heart condition such as an irregular or slow heartbeat, QTc 
prolongation, a family history of QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, or have a low blood level 
of potassium or magnesium.
-
if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer.
-
if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine.
-
if you have, or have ever had, seizures.
-
if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease.
-
if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function.
-
if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function.
-
if you suffer from trembling.
-
if you have a low body weight.
-
if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and 
diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are 
prolonged.
If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this 
medicine.
If you have not taken Nimvastid for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have 
talked to your doctor.
Children and adolescents
There is no relevant use of Nimvastid in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer s 
disease.
Other medicines and Nimvastid
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Nimvastid should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Nimvastid. 
Nimvastid might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps 
or spasms, to treat Parkinson s disease or to prevent travel sickness).
Nimvastid should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or 
prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff 
limbs and trembling hands.
If you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Nimvastid, tell your doctor before you are given any 
anaesthetics, because Nimvastid may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during 
anaesthesia.
Caution when Nimvastid is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat 
hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause 
problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness.
Caution when Nimvastid is taken together with other medicines that can affect your heart rhythm or
the electrical system of your heart (QT prolongation).
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Nimvastid must be assessed against the possible effects on 
your unborn child. Nimvastid should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Nimvastid.
Driving and using machines
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Nimvastid may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing 
the dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your 
attention.</p>         </div>"""

How to start treatment
Your doctor will tell you what dose of Nimvastid to take.</p>
<p>Treatment usually starts with a low dose.</p>
<p>Your doctor will slowly increase your dose depending on how you respond to treatment.</p>
<p>The highest dose that should be taken is 6.0 mg twice a day.
Your doctor will regularly check if the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will also monitor 
your weight whilst you are taking this medicine.
If you have not taken Nimvastid for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have 
talked to your doctor.
Taking this medicine</p>
<p>Tell your caregiver that you are taking Nimvastid.</p>
<p>To benefit from your medicine, take it every day.</p>
<p>Take Nimvastid twice a day, in the morning and evening, with food.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole with a drink.</p>
<p>Do not open or crush the capsules.
If you take more Nimvastid than you should
If you accidentally take more Nimvastid than you should, inform your doctor. You may require 
medical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Nimvastid have experienced 
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow 
heartbeat and fainting may also occur.
If you forget to take Nimvastid
If you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Nimvastid, wait and take the next dose at the usual 
time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
