NINLARO is a cancer medicine that contains ixazomib, a  proteasome inhibitor . </p>
<p>NINLARO is used to treat a cancer of the bone marrow called multiple myeloma. Its active substance 
ixazomib works by blocking the action of proteasomes. These are structures inside the cell that digest 
proteins and are important for cell survival. Because myeloma cells produce a lot of proteins, blocking 
the action of proteasomes can kill the cancerous cells. </p>
<p>What NINLARO is used for 
NINLARO is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma. NINLARO will be given to you together 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, which are other medicines used to treat multiple myeloma. </p>
<p>What multiple myeloma is<br />
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the blood which affects a type of cell, called the plasma cell. A 
plasma cell is a blood cell that normally produces proteins to fight infections. People with multiple 
myeloma have cancerous plasma cells, also called myeloma cells, which can damage the bones. 
Protein produced by myeloma cells can damage the kidneys. Treatment for multiple myeloma involves 
killing myeloma cells and reducing the symptoms of the disease.  </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to ixazomib or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>If you are uncertain whether the condition above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before taking NINLARO. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking or during treatment with NINLARO if: 
* you have a history of bleeding 
* you have persistent nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea 
* you have a history of nerve problems, to include tingling and numbness 
* you have a history of swelling 
* you have a persistent rash or a severe skin rash with skin peeling and mouth sores (Stevens 
Johnson syndrome) 
* you have or have had liver or kidney problems as your dose may have to be adjusted 
* you have or have had damage to the smallest blood vessels known as thrombotic 
microangiopathy or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Tell your doctor if you develop 
fatigue, fever, bruising, bleeding, decreased urination, swelling, confusion, vision loss, and 
seizures. </p>
<p>Your doctor will examine you and you will be monitored closely during treatment. Before starting 
NINLARO and during treatment, you will have blood tests to check that you have enough blood cells. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
NINLARO is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NINLARO 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes any medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins or herbal 
remedies. This is because other medicines can affect the way NINLARO works. In particular, tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum). These medicines should be 
avoided as they may reduce the effectiveness of NINLARO. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
NINLARO is not recommended during pregnancy as it may harm your unborn baby. Breast-feeding 
should be stopped when taking NINLARO. </p>
<p>Avoid becoming pregnant or breast-feeding while being treated with NINLARO. If you are pregnant 
or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>If you are a woman of childbearing potential or a man who can father a child, you must use effective 
contraception during and for 90 days after treatment. Women using hormonal contraceptives should 
additionally use a barrier method of contraception. Tell doctor right away if you or your partner 
becomes pregnant while receiving NINLARO. 
As NINLARO is given in combination with lenalidomide, you should adhere to the pregnancy 
prevention programme of lenalidomide because lenalidomide can be harmful to the unborn child. </p>
<p>See the package leaflets for lenalidomide and dexamethasone for additional information on pregnancy 
and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
NINLARO may affect your ability to drive or use machines. You may feel tired and dizzy while 
taking NINLARO. Do not drive or operate machines if you have these side effects. </p>         </div>"""
