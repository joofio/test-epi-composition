<p>Nityr is used to treat:</p>

<li>A rare disease called hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 in adults, adolescents and children.  </li>
<li>A rare disease called alkaptonuria (AKU) in adults. </li>
</ul>
<p>In these diseases your body is unable to completely break down the amino acid tyrosine (amino acids 
are building blocks of our proteins), forming harmful substances. These substances are accumulated in 
your body. Nityr blocks the breakdown of tyrosine and the harmful substances are not formed.  </p>
<p>For the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, you must follow a special diet while you are 
taking this medicine, because tyrosine will remain in your body. This special diet is based on low 
tyrosine and phenylalanine (another amino acid) content.  </p>
<p>For the treatment of AKU, your doctor may advise you to follow a special diet. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nityr.<br />
- Your eyes will be checked by an ophthalmologist before and regularly during nitisinone treatment. 
If you get red eyes or any other signs of effects on the eyes, contact your doctor immediately for 
an eye examination. Eye problems could be a sign of inadequate dietary control (see section 4).<br />
During the treatment, blood samples will be drawn in order for your doctor to check whether the 
treatment is adequate and to make sure that there are no possible side effects causing blood disorders.  </p>
<p>If you receive Nityr for treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, your liver will be checked at 
regular intervals because the disease affects the liver. </p>
<p>Follow-up by your doctor should be performed every 6 months. If you experience any side effects, 
shorter intervals are recommended.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nityr<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Nityr may interfere with the effect of other medicines, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines for epilepsy (such as phenytoin) </li>
<li>Medicines against blood clotting (such as warfarin)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Nityr with food<br />
Nityr can be taken with or without food throughout your course of treatment.  </p>

<p>For hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, the recommended total daily dose is 1 mg/kg body weight 
administered orally. Your doctor will adjust the dose individually.<br />
It is recommended to administer the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with 
body weight &lt; 20 kg, it is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in 
this patient population. </p>
<p>For AKU, the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. </p>
<p>Patients who have problems swallowing Nityr tablets whole, are recommended to take alternative 
nitisinone formulations.   </p>

<p>If you notice any side effects relating to the eyes, talk to your doctor immediately to have an eye 
examination. Treatment with nitisinone leads to higher levels of tyrosine in the blood which can cause 
eye related symptoms. In patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, commonly reported eye related 
side effects (may affect more than 1 in 100 people) caused by higher tyrosine levels are inflammation 
in the eye (conjunctivitis), opacity and inflammation in the cornea (keratitis), sensitivity to light 
(photophobia) and eye pain. Inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis) is an uncommon side effect (may 
affect up to 1 in 100 people). </p>
<p>In AKU patients, eye irritation (keratopathy) and eye pain are very commonly reported side effects 
(may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  </p>
<p>Other side effects reported in patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 are listed below: 
Other common side effects<br />
- Reduced number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and white blood cells (leukopenia), shortage of 
certain white blood cells (granulocytopenia).  </p>
<p>Other uncommon side effects<br />
- increased number of white blood cells (leucocytosis),<br />
- itching (pruritus), skin inflammation (exfoliative dermatitis), rash.  </p>
<p>Other side effects reported in patients with AKU are listed below: 
Other common side effects 
- bronchitis 
- pneumonia 
- itching (pruritus), rash </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the
