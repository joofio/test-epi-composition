  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Nivestim is a white blood cell growth factor (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) and belongs to a 
group of medicines called cytokines. Growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally in the 
body but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. Nivestim works by 
encouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. </p>
<p>A reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes 
your body less able to fight infection. Nivestim stimulates the bone marrow to produce new white cells 
quickly. </p>
<p>Nivestim can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent 
infections; </li>
<li>to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent 
infections; </li>
<li>before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be 
collected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from a 
donor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells; </li>
<li>to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help 
prevent infections; </li>
<li>in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections. </li>

section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nivestim. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>sickle cell anaemia, as Nivestim may cause sickle cell crisis. </li>
<li>osteoporosis (bone disease). </li>
</ul>
<p>Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Nivestim, if you: 
* have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, 
tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these 
could be signs of a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). 
* experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you 
notice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis). 
* get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left 
shoulder (these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of 
the spleen). 
* notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets 
(thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot).  </p>
<p>Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) 
has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, 
abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you 
experience these symptoms.  </p>
<p>Loss of response to filgrastim </p>
<p>If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your 
doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise filgrastim s activity. </p>
<p>Your doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. </p>
<p>If you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the 
blood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). You should talk to your doctor about your risks 
of developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to 
develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Nivestim, unless instructed by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between 16 and 60 years. </p>
<p>Take special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells </p>
<p>Nivestim is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your 
healthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nivestim </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Nivestim has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women.  </p>
<p>Nivestim is not recommended during pregnancy. </p>
<p>It is important to tell your doctor if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>are pregnant or breast-feeding; </li>
<li>think you may be pregnant; or  </li>
<li>are planning to have a baby.  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you become pregnant during Nivestim treatment, please inform your doctor.  </p>
<p>Unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Nivestim.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Nivestim may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may 
cause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after taking Nivestim and before driving 
or operating machinery. </p>
<p>Nivestim contains sodium  </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.6 mg/ml or 0.96 mg/ml dose, that is to 
say essentially  sodium-free . </p>
<p>Nivestim contains sorbitol </p>
<p>This medicine contains 50 mg sorbitol in each ml. </p>
<p>Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare 
genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break 
down fructose, which may cause serious side effects. </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your 
child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects 
such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea.  </p>         </div>"""

pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How is Nivestim given and how much should I take? </p>
<p>Nivestim is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a 
subcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an 
intravenous infusion). The usual dose varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will 
tell you how much Nivestim you should take. </p>
<p>Patients having a bone marrow transplant after chemotherapy: 
You will normally receive your first dose of Nivestim at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy and at 
least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. </p>
<p>You, or people caring for you, can be taught how to give subcutaneous injections so that you can 
continue your treatment at home. However, you should not attempt this unless you have been properly 
trained first by your healthcare provider. </p>
<p>How long will I have to take Nivestim? </p>
<p>You will need to take Nivestim until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood tests will be 
taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you how long you 
will need to take Nivestim. </p>
<p>Use in children </p>
<p>Nivestim is used to treat children who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from severe low 
white blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children receiving chemotherapy is the same as for 
adults. </p>
<p>If you use more Nivestim than you should </p>
<p>Do not increase the dose your doctor has given you. If you think you have injected more than you 
should, contact your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Nivestim </p>
<p>If you have missed an injection, or injected too little, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for any missed doses. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Please tell your doctor immediately during treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the 
face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). </li>
<li>if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). </li>
<li>if you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients 
who received filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or 
ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual. </li>
<li>if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: * 
swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, 
difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of 
tiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. 
These could be symptoms of a condition called  Capillary Leak Syndrome  which causes blood 
to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. </li>
<li>if you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: * 
fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, 
shortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. 
These could be symptoms of a condition called  sepsis  (also called  blood poisoning ), a 
severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and 
needs urgent medical attention. </li>
<li>if you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your 
shoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) 
or rupture of the spleen). </li>
<li>if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine 
(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if 
protein is found in your urine (proteinuria). </li>
</ul>
<p>A common side effect of filgrastim use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which 
can be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a stem cell 
or bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur - this is a reaction of the 
donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms 
of your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, 
lungs, vagina and joints.  </p>
<p>In normal stem cell donors, an increase in white blood cells (leucocytosis) and a decrease of platelets 
may be seen. This reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia). These will be 
monitored by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
* decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia)
