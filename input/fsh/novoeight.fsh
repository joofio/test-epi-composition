* if you are allergic to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6) 
* if you are allergic to hamster proteins. </p>
<p>Do not use NovoEight if either of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor 
before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using NovoEight. </p>
<p>There is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to NovoEight. Early signs of allergic reactions are rash, hives, weals, generalised itching, 
swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness of the chest, general feeling of 
being unwell, and dizziness. </p>
<p>If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleed is not being controlled with the dose you receive, as 
there can be several reasons for this. Some people using this medicine can develop antibodies to factor 
VIII (also known as factor VIII inhibitors). Factor VIII inhibitors make NovoEight less effective in 
preventing or controlling bleeding. If this happens you may need a higher dose of NovoEight or a 
different medicine to control your bleed. Do not increase the total dose of NovoEight to control your 
bleed without talking to your doctor. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously treated 
with factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher risk that 
it happens again. </p>
<p>The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with NovoEight, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NovoEight 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
NovoEight has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>NovoEight contains sodium 
This medicine contains 30.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per reconstituted vial.<br />
This is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

haemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor 
if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate your dose for you. This will depend on your weight and what the medicine 
is being used for.  </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of NovoEight is 20 to 50 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. The injection 
is given every 2 to 3 days. In some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or 
higher doses may be needed. </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of NovoEight is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
NovoEight can be used in children of all ages. In children (below the age of 12) higher doses or more 
frequent injections may be needed. Adolescents (above the age of 12) can use the same dose as adults. </p>
<p>How NovoEight is given 
NovoEight is given as an injection into a vein. See ‘Instructions on how to use NovoEight’ for more 
information. </p>
<p>If you use more NovoEight than you should 
If you use more NovoEight than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to use NovoEight 
You should contact your doctor if you have missed a dose and do not know how to compensate for 
this.  </p>
<p>If you stop using NovoEight 
If you stop using NovoEight you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may 
not stop. Do not stop using NovoEight without talking to your doctor. </p>
