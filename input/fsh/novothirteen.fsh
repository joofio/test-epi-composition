NovoThirteen contains the active substance catridecacog, which is identical to human coagulation 
factor XIII, an enzyme necessary for blood clotting. NovoThirteen replaces the missing factor XIII and 
helps to stabilise the initial blood clot by producing a mesh around the clot. </p>
<p>What NovoThirteen is used for 
NovoThirteen is used to prevent bleeding in patients who do not have enough or are missing part of 
factor XIII (that is called A-subunit). </p>         </div>"""

bleeding disorders. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>Before you can use NovoThirteen for injection you need to reconstitute the product. Please see 
NovoThirteen user instructions. </p>
<p>NovoThirteen is given as an injection into a vein. Your dose will depend on your body weight. The 
usual dose for prevention of bleeds is 35 IU for each kilogram of body weight. The injections are 
given once a month (every 28   2 days). 
If you experience a bleed, you should contact your doctor who will decide if an injection is needed.<br />
NovoThirteen should be injected at a rate not higher than 2 ml/minute. </p>
<p>Based on the concentration of NovoThirteen solution, the dose volume to be injected (in millilitres) 
can be calculated from this formula:<br />
Dose volume in millilitres = 0.042 x your body weight in kilograms. </p>
<p>You should only use the prescribed dose calculated by your doctor from this formula considering that 
the usual dose and the concentration of NovoThirteen are different from those of the other products 
which contain factor XIII.<br />
Your doctor may adapt the dose if this is deemed necessary. </p>
<p>Use in small children 
For children weighing less than 24 kg the reconstituted NovoThirteen should be further diluted with 
6 ml of sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection to be able to handle the dosing of small children. 
For more information see section  NovoThirteen user instructions   Instructions of how to dilute the 
reconstituted NovoThirteen . </p>
<p>The dose volume for the reconstituted NovoThirteen diluted with 6 ml sodium chloride 0.9%, solution 
for injection can be calculated from this formula: </p>
<p>Dose volume in millilitres = 0.117 x body weight in kilograms. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents (weighing more than 24 kg) 
NovoThirteen can be used in children and adolescents in the same way as in adults for both prevention 
of bleeds and if you experience a bleed. </p>
<p>If you use more NovoThirteen than you should 
There is limited information on overdose with NovoThirteen. None of the reported cases have shown 
any signs of illness. Contact your doctor if you have injected more NovoThirteen than you have been 
instructed. </p>
<p>If you forget to use NovoThirteen 
If you forget an injection of NovoThirteen, talk to your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using NovoThirteen 
If you stop using NovoThirteen, you are not protected against bleeding. Do not stop using 
NovoThirteen without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will explain what might happen if you stop 
treatment and discuss other options with you. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
