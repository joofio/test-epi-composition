  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Nucala contains the active substance mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. It is used to treat severe asthma and 
EGPA (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 
years and older. It is also used to treat CRSwNP (Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps) and HES 
(Hypereosinophilic syndrome) in adults. </p>
<p>Mepolizumab, the active substance in Nucala, blocks a protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the 
action of this protein, it limits the production of eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the 
number of eosinophils in the bloodstream and the lungs. </p>
<p>Severe eosinophilic asthma </p>
<p>Some people with severe asthma have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and lungs. This condition is called eosinophilic asthma – the type of asthma Nucala can treat. </p>
<p>Nucala can reduce your number of asthma attacks, if you or your child are already using medicines 
such as high dose inhalers, but your asthma is not well controlled by these medicines.<br />
If you are taking medicines called oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you 
need to control your asthma. </p>
<p>Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) </p>
<p>CRSwNP is a condition in which people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the 
blood, and tissue lining the nose and sinuses. This can cause symptoms such as a blocked nose and 
loss of smell, and soft jelly-like growths (called nasal polyps) to form inside the nose.  </p>
<p>Nucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and can reduce the size of your polyps, 
relieves your nasal congestion and helps prevent surgery for nasal polyps.<br />
Nucala can also help reduce the need for oral corticosteroids to control your symptoms. </p>
<p>Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) </p>
<p>EGPA is a condition where people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and tissues and also have a form of vasculitis. This means there is inflammation of the blood vessels. 
This condition most commonly affects the lungs and sinuses but often affects other organs such as the 
skin, heart and kidneys. </p>
<p>Nucala can control and delay a flare-up of these EGPA symptoms. This medicine can also help reduce 
the daily dose of oral corticosteroids you need to control your symptoms. </p>
<p>Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) </p>
<p>Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a condition in which there are a high number of eosinophils (a 
type of blood cell) in the blood. These cells can damage organs in the body, particularly the heart, 
lungs, nerves and skin. 
Nucala helps reduce your symptoms and prevents flares. If you are taking medicines often referred to 
as oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you need to control your HES 
symptoms/flares. </p>         </div>"""
