- if you are allergic to botulinum toxin type A or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
- if you have myasthenia gravis or Eaton Lambert syndrome (chronic diseases affecting the 
muscles); 
- if you have an infection or inflammation at the proposed injection sites. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Side effects possibly related to the spread of botulinum toxin from the site of injection can occur very 
rarely (e.g. muscle weakness, difficulty in swallowing or food or liquid entering the airways). Patients 
receiving recommended doses may have exaggerated muscle weakness. </p>
<p>Visit your doctor immediately if you find it difficult to swallow, to speak or to breathe after treatment.  </p>
<ul>
<li>NUCEIVA is not recommended in patients who have had problems swallowing (dysphagia) and 
breathing. </li>
<li>Too frequent or excessive dosing may lead to antibody formation. Antibody formation can stop 
botulinum toxin type A from working even for other uses. To prevent this, there must be a gap 
of at least three months between doses. </li>
<li>Very rarely, an allergic reaction can occur after the injection of botulinum toxin. </li>
<li>Drooping of the eyelid may occur after treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please tell your doctor if: 
- you had problems with previous botulinum toxin injections; 
- you see no significant improvement of your lines one month after your first course of treatment; 
- you suffer from certain diseases affecting your nervous system (such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis or motor neuropathy); 
- you have inflammation at the proposed injection site(s); 
- the muscles to be injected are weak or wasted; 
- you have a bleeding disorder as injection may lead to bruising. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of NUCEIVA is not recommended in individuals under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NUCEIVA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>The use of botulinum toxin is not recommended in association with aminoglycoside antibiotics, 
spectinomycin or other medicines that interfere with nerve impulses to the muscle. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have recently been injected with a medicine containing botulinum toxin (the 
active substance of NUCEIVA), as this may increase the effect of NUCEIVA excessively. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. </p>
<p>The use of NUCEIVA is not recommended during pregnancy and in women able to have children who 
are not using contraception.  </p>
<p>NUCEIVA is not recommended in breast-feeding women. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Muscle weakness, dizziness, and visual disturbance with this medicine could make driving or the use 
of machines dangerous. Do not drive or use machinery until such effects have cleared. </p>
<p>NUCEIVA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose; this means it is essentially 
‘sodium- free’. </p>         </div>"""
