NULIBRY contains the active substance fosdenopterin.<br />
NULIBRY is given to people with the genetic disease molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type 
A. It is given to people when doctors suspect that they might have MoCD Type A. It needs to be 
continued for life if MoCD Type A is confirmed by genetic testing. </p>
<p>What molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A is 
MoCD Type A is a rare inborn error of the natural chemical processes needed for your body to work 
(metabolism). Signs of this genetic disease usually appear shortly after birth and include difficulty 
feeding and seizures. Other signs are a decreased awareness or reaction to the environment, an 
increase in startle reactions to a sudden event, and weak or stiff muscles. </p>
<p>MoCD type A results from an error in the gene called MOCS1. This stops the body from making an 
essential substance called cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate. When this substance is missing, certain 
compounds (sulphites) formed in the body cannot be broken down. These compounds are toxic to the 
brain and can negatively affect or delay the development of a child. </p>
<p>How NULIBRY works 
NULIBRY provides the missing substance that you or your child’s body needs to break down the 
harmful sulphite compounds. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before using NULIBRY.  </p>
<p>Patients who use NULIBRY may become sensitive to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light. During 
treatment with fosdenopterin, patients should avoid exposure to sunlight, and wear sunscreen, 
protective clothing, and sunglasses when exposed to the sun. Tell your doctor immediately if you or 
your child develops a rash, redness or blisters on sun-exposed areas of the skin, or if you or your child 
experience a burning sensation of the skin. </p>
<p>Due to the use of sunscreens and sun protective clothing your doctor may prescribe additional 
vitamin D as necessary.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and NULIBRY 
It is unlikely that NULIBRY has an influence on or is influenced by other medicines. However, tell 
your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>NULIBRY contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially

<p>A doctor who is experienced in the management of inborn errors of metabolism will start and 
supervise the treatment with NULIBRY. </p>
<p>NULIBRY can be given at home. Before you do this for the first time, your doctor or nurse will train 
you in how to prepare the medicine and give you or your child a dose of NULIBRY.  </p>

or your child are not sure about how to use NULIBRY.  </p>

The dose depends on your child’s age and body weight. You will need to give the dose once each day. 
Your doctor will work out the dose you need to give. </p>
<p>If you use more NULIBRY than you should 
If you think you or your child may have been given more NULIBRY than prescribed, tell your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>If you forgot to give a dose of NULIBRY. 
If a dose of NULIBRY is missed, give the missed dose as soon as possible. Wait at least 6 hours
