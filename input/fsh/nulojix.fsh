* If you are allergic to belatacept or any of the other ingredients of the medicine (listed in 
section 6). Allergic reactions related to belatacept use have been reported in the clinical studies. 
* If you have not been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or are uncertain of previous 
exposure, you must not be treated with NULOJIX. EBV is the virus that causes glandular fever. 
If you have not been exposed to it, you are at a higher risk of getting a type of cancer called 
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). If you are not sure if you have been 
infected with the virus before, ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder </p>
<p>Treatment with NULOJIX increases the risk of getting a type of cancer called post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). With NULOJIX treatment, this more often develops in the brain 
and can lead to death. People are at a higher risk of developing PTLD in the following cases: 
* If you have not been exposed to EBV prior to your transplant 
* If you are infected with a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
* If you have been given a therapy for treatment of acute rejection, such as antithymocyte 
globulin to reduce T-cells. T-cells are cells responsible for maintaining your body's ability to 
resist disease and infections. They may cause rejection of your transplanted kidney. 
* If you are not sure about any of these conditions, ask you doctor. 
Serious infections </p>
<p>Serious infections can happen with NULOJIX treatment and can lead to death. </p>
<p>NULOJIX weakens the body s ability to fight infections. Serious infections can include 
* Tuberculosis 
* Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a virus that can cause serious tissue and blood infections 
* Shingles 
* Other herpes virus infections. </p>
<p>There have been reports of a rare type of brain infection called progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) that have occurred in patients who have been given NULOJIX. PML 
often leads to severe disability or death. </p>
<p>Tell your family or caregiver about your treatment. You might get symptoms that you might not be 
aware of yourself. Your doctor may need to investigate your symptoms to rule out PML, PTLD or 
other infections. For a list of symptoms please see section 4,  Possible side effects . </p>
<p>Skin cancer </p>
<p>Limit your exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light whilst using NULOJIX. Wear protective 
clothing and use a sunscreen with a high protection factor. People who use NULOJIX have a higher 
risk of getting certain other types of cancer, especially skin cancer. </p>
<p>Blood clotting in your transplanted kidney </p>
<p>Depending on the type of kidney transplant that you received, you may be at higher risk of blood 
clotting in your transplanted kidney. </p>
<p>Use in conversion from another type of immunosuppressive maintenance treatment </p>
<p>If your healthcare professional changes your maintenance treatment to a NULOJIX based 
immunosuppressive regimen, he/she may check your kidney function more often for a period of time 
after the change, to monitor for rejection. </p>
<p>Use in liver transplants </p>
<p>The use of NULOJIX is not recommended if you have had a liver transplant. </p>
<p>Use with other immunosuppressive medicines </p>
<p>Nulojix is normally given with steroids. Too rapid reduction of steroid intake can increase the risk that 
your body may reject the transplanted kidney. Please take the exact steroid dose as determined by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
NULOJIX has not been studied in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, therefore it is not 
recommended in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NULOJIX 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicine while using NULOJIX. </p>
<p>The use of live vaccines should be avoided with the use of NULOJIX. Tell your doctor if you need to 
have vaccinations. Your doctor will advise you what to do. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you become pregnant while using NULOJIX, tell your doctor. 
Do not use NULOJIX if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. The effects 
of NULOJIX in pregnant women are not known. You must not get pregnant while using NULOJIX. If 
you are of child bearing potential, you should use effective contraception during treatment with 
NULOJIX and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of treatment since the potential risk to 
embryonic/foetal development is unknown. Your doctor will advise you about using a reliable 
contraceptive. </p>
<p>You must stop breast-feeding if you are being treated with NULOJIX. It is not known whether 
belatacept, the active substance, passes into human milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Belatacept has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However you should not 
drive or operate any machines if you are feeling tired or unwell after receiving NULOJIX. </p>
<p>NULOJIX contains sodium 
Tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are treated with NULOJIX. 
This medicine contains 0.55 mmol (or 13 mg) sodium per vial. This is equivalent to 0.64% of the 
recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>At the time of your kidney transplant you may be given NULOJIX in combination with other types of 
immunosuppressant medication to help prevent your body from rejecting your transplanted kidney. </p>
<p>Your doctor may decide to change your immunosuppressive treatment to a treatment with NULOJIX 
during the maintenance phase after your kidney transplant. </p>
<p>Information for medical and healthcare professionals on dose calculation, preparation and 
administration of NULOJIX is provided at the end of the leaflet. </p>
<p>If you are given more NULOJIX than you should 
If this happens, your doctor will monitor you for any signs or symptoms of side effects, and treat these 
symptoms if necessary. </p>
<p>If you forget to use NULOJIX 
It is very important for you to keep all appointments to receive NULOJIX. If you miss receiving 
NULOJIX when you are supposed to, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using NULOJIX 
Your body may reject the transplanted kidney if you stop using NULOJIX. The decision to stop using 
NULOJIX should be discussed with your doctor and another therapy will generally be started. 
If you stop treatment with NULOJIX for a long period of time, without taking any other medicines to 
prevent rejection, and then restart, it is not known if belatacept will have the same effect as before. </p>
