<p>The vaccine causes the immune system (the body s natural defences) to produce antibodies and 
specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, to give protection against COVID-19. None

  if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid if: 
  you have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given Nuvaxovid in the past, 
  you have ever fainted following any needle injection, 
  you have a high fever (over 38 C) or severe infection. However, you can have your vaccination if 
you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold, 
  you have bleeding problems, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots, 
  your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines 
that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or 
cancer medicines). </p>
<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Nuvaxovid (see section 4).<br />
These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days.<br />
Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.   </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before 
you are given Nuvaxovid. </p>
<p>As with any vaccine, the 2-dose vaccination course of Nuvaxovid may not fully protect all those who 
receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Nuvaxovid is not recommended for children aged below 12 years. Currently, there is no information 
available on the use of Nuvaxovid in children younger than 12 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nuvaxovid </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines or vaccines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Some of the side effects of Nuvaxovid listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily 
reduce your ability to drive and use machines (for example, feeling faint or lightheaded or feeling very 
tired).  </p>
<p>Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  </p>
<p>Nuvaxovid contains sodium and potassium  </p>
<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>
<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say, essentially 
 potassium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>A booster dose of Nuvaxovid may be given approximately 3 months after the second dose in

<p>During and after each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will watch over you 
for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. </p>
