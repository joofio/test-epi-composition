If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before using Nuwiq. </p>
<p>There is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to Nuwiq. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions as they are listed in 
section 4 “Allergic reactions”.<br />
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. </p>
<p>The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with Nuwiq, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Cardiovascular events<br />
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk. </p>
<p>Catheter-related complications 
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. </p>
<p>It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Nuwiq. </p>
<p>So, every time you get a new package of Nuwiq, note down the date and the batch number (which is 
on the packaging after Lot) and keep this information in a safe place. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nuwiq 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Nuwiq has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>Nuwiq contains sodium 
This medicine contains 18.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.92 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Treatment with Nuwiq will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with 
your doctor or nurse if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Nuwiq is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or a nurse who are experienced in 
the care of patients with haemophilia A. You or someone else might also give your Nuwiq injection, 
but only after receiving adequate training. </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate your dose of Nuwiq (in international units = IU) depending on your 
condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. How 
often you need an injection will depend on how well Nuwiq is working for you. Usually, treatment for 
haemophilia A is a life-long treatment. </p>
<p>Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of Nuwiq is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, given every 2 to 3 days. However, in 
some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary. </p>
<p>Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of Nuwiq is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.  </p>
<p>If you have the impression that the effect of Nuwiq is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor 
will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This 
is particularly important if you are having major surgery. </p>
<p>Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors 
If your plasma factor VIII fails to reach expected levels with Nuwiq, or if bleeding is not adequately 
controlled, it could be due to the development of factor VIII inhibitors. This will be checked by your 
doctor. You might need a higher dose of Nuwiq or a different product to control bleedings. Do not 
increase the total dose of Nuwiq to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
The way Nuwiq is used in children and adolescents does not differ from the way it is used in adults. 
Because factor VIII products may have to be given more often in children and adolescents, a central 
venous access device (CVAD) may need to be fitted. A CVAD is an external connector that allows 
access to the bloodstream through a catheter without injection through the skin. </p>
<p>If you use more Nuwiq than you should 
No symptoms of overdose have been reported. If you have injected more Nuwiq than you should, 
please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Nuwiq 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately 
and continue as advised by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop using Nuwiq 
Do not stop using Nuwiq without consulting your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Please stop using this medicine immediately and seek urgent medical advice if: 
- you notice symptoms of allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions may include rash, hives, urticaria (itchy rash), including generalized 
urticaria, swelling of lips and tongue, shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness of the chest, 
vomiting, restlessness, low blood pressure, and dizziness. These symptoms can be early 
symptoms of an anaphylactic shock. If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur 
(very rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people), the injection must be stopped immediately, 
and you must contact your doctor right away. Severe symptoms require prompt emergency 
treatment. 
- you notice that the medicine stops working properly (bleeding is not stopped or becomes 
frequent)<br />
For children and adolescents not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor 
antibodies (see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients). 
However, for patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens, your or 
your child´s medicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience 
persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Common side effects may affect up to 1 in 10 people 
Hypersensitivity, fever. </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 100 people 
Tingling or numbness (paraesthesia), headache, dizziness, vertigo, dyspnoea, dry mouth, back pain, 
injection site inflammation, injection site pain, a vague feeling of bodily discomfort (malaise), 
haemorrhagic anaemia, anaemia, chest pain, non-neutralising antibody positive (in previously treated 
patients). </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
