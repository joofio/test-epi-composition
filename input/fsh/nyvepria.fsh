chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells) to reduce the duration of neutropenia 
(low neutrophil count, a type of white blood cell) and to help prevent febrile neutropenia (low white 
blood cell count with a fever). Nyvepria is for use in adults aged 18 years and over.
White blood cells are important for fighting off infection. If the white blood cell count to fall too low, 
due to your cytotoxic chemotherapy, your body may not be able to fight off microorganisms and this 
will increase the chances of an infection. Pegfilgrastim, is very similar to a natural protein in the body 
called granulocyte colony stimulating factor and it works by encouraging your bone marrow to 
produce more white blood cells that help your body fight off infections. </p>         </div>"""
