chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells) to reduce the duration of neutropenia 
(low neutrophil count, a type of white blood cell) and to help prevent febrile neutropenia (low white 
blood cell count with a fever). Nyvepria is for use in adults aged 18 years and over.
White blood cells are important for fighting off infection. If the white blood cell count to fall too low, 
due to your cytotoxic chemotherapy, your body may not be able to fight off microorganisms and this 
will increase the chances of an infection. Pegfilgrastim, is very similar to a natural protein in the body 
called granulocyte colony stimulating factor and it works by encouraging your bone marrow to 
produce more white blood cells that help your body fight off infections. </p>         </div>"""

oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease), or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung 
infiltration). </p>
<p>If you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) 
or decreased blood platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), which reduces the ability of your blood 
to clot. Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. </p>
<p>If you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse while using Nyvepria: </p>
<p>If you are a patient with breast cancer or lung cancer, pegfilgrastim in combination with 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may increase your risk of a precancerous blood condition
called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML). Symptoms may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding.</p>
<p>If you get an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, 
swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, 
skin rash or hives on the skin and areas of the skin that itch.</p>
<p>If you get a cough or fever, and have difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS).</p>
<p>If you have any of the following side effects: </p>
<p>swelling or puffiness, passing urine less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal (belly)
swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness.
These could be symptoms of condition called capillary leak syndrome which causes blood to 
leak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4.<br />
If you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a 
problem with your spleen (splenomegaly).</p>

inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the 
body). This disorder can occur rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors.
Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Nyvepria can damage your kidneys 
(glomerulonephritis). 
Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome; a skin condition that causes painful blisters and 
sores of the skin and mucous membranes, especially in the mouth) have been reported with the use of 
pegfilgrastim. Stop using Nyvepria and get medical attention immediately if you notice any of these

Nyvepria, unless instructed by your doctor.

your doctor or healthcare provider for help.</p>

<p>Nyvepria is given as an injection into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection).</p>
<p>Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the date has passed the last day of the month shown.</p>
<p>Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject.</p>
<p>Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it has been dropped on a hard surface. Use a new pre-
filled syringe and call your doctor or healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Do not activate the pre-filled syringe before injection.</p>
<p>Do not remove the clear automatic needle guard from the pre-filled syringe.</p>
<p>Do not remove the peelable label on the pre-filled syringe barrel before injecting the 
medicine.
Call your doctor or healthcare provider if you have any questions.
Step 1: Prepare
A
Remove the pre-filled syringe carton from the refrigerator. Remove the pre-filled syringe inner 
carton from the outer carton by peeling away the cover and gather the supplies needed for your 
injection: alcohol wipes, a cotton ball or gauze pad, a plaster and a sharps disposal container (not 
included).
For a more comfortable injection, leave the pre-filled syringe at room temperature (not above 25 C)
for about 30 minutes before injecting. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
On a clean, well-lit work surface, place the new pre-filled syringe and the other supplies.</p>
<p>Do not warm the syringe by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave.</p>
<p>Do not leave the pre-filled syringe exposed to direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Do not shake the pre-filled syringe.</p>
<p>Keep pre-filled syringes out of the sight and reach of children.
B
Open the inner syringe carton by peeling away the cover. Grab the pre-filled syringe automatic 
needle guard to remove the pre-filled syringe from the carton.
For safety reasons:</p>
<p>Do not grasp the plunger rod.</p>
<p>Do not grasp the needle cover.
C
Inspect the medicine and pre-filled syringe.</p>
<p>Do not use the pre-filled syringe if:</p>
<p>The medicine is cloudy or there are particles in it. It must be a clear and colourless liquid.</p>
<p>Any part appears cracked or broken.</p>
<p>The needle cover is missing or not securely attached.</p>
<p>The expiry date printed on the label has passed the last day of the month shown.
In all cases, call your doctor or healthcare provider.
Step 2: Get ready
A
Wash your hands thoroughly. Prepare and clean your injection site.

<p>Upper part of your thigh.</p>
<p>Belly, except for a 5 cm (2-inch) area right around your belly button.</p>
<p>Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection).
Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry.</p>
<p>Do not touch the injection site before injecting.
Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into 
areas with scars or stretch marks.
B
Hold the pre-filled syringe by the automatic needle guard. Carefully pull the needle cover straight 
out and away from your body. Throw away the needle cover into the sharps disposal container. Do 
not recap.</p>
<p>C
Pinch your injection site to create a firm surface.
It is important to keep the skin pinched when injecting.
Step 3: Inject
A
Hold the pinch. INSERT the needle into skin at 45 to 90 degrees.</p>
<p>Do not touch the cleaned area of the skin.
B
PUSH the plunger rod with slow and constant pressure until it reaches the bottom.
C
When the syringe is empty, LIFT the syringe off skin.
After releasing the plunger rod, the pre-filled syringe automatic needle guard will safely cover the 
injection needle.</p>
<p>Do not put the needle cover back on used pre-filled syringes.
When you remove the syringe, if it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this 
means you have not received a full dose. Call your doctor or healthcare provider right away.
Healthcare providers only
The trade name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the 
patient file.
Remove and save the pre-filled syringe label.
Turn the plunger rod to move the label into a position where you can remove the syringe label.
Step 4: Finish
A

dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.
Keep the syringe and sharps disposal container out of sight and reach of children.</p>
<p>Do not reuse the pre-filled syringe.</p>
<p>Do not recycle pre-filled syringes or throw them into household waste.
