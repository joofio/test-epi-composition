<p>Nyxoid is a nasal spray used for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose or possible opioid 
overdose in adults and adolescents over 14 years.  Signs of overdose include:<br />
<em> breathing problems<br />
</em> severe sleepiness<br />
* not responding to a loud noise or touch. </p>
<p>If you are at risk of an opioid overdose you should always carry your Nyxoid with you. Nyxoid 
works for a short time only to reverse the effects of opioids while you wait for emergency medical 
attention.  It is not a substitute for emergency medical care.  Nyxoid is intended for use by 
appropriately trained individuals.   </p>
<p>Always tell your friends and family that you carry Nyxoid with you. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to naloxone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Nyxoid will be supplied to you only after you or your carer have been taught how to use it. </p>
<p>It is to be given right away and does not take the place of emergency medical care.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency services should be called if an opioid overdose is suspected. </li>
</ul>
<p>The signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose can return after this nasal spray is given.  If this 
happens, further doses may be given after 2 to 3 minutes using a new nasal spray.  The patient should 
be monitored closely until emergency help has arrived after being given this medicine. </p>
<p>Conditions to look out for 
* If you are physically dependent on opioids or if you have received high doses of opioids (for 
example heroin, methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone, buprenorphine or morphine).  You may get 
strong withdrawal symptoms with this medicine (see later in section 4 of this leaflet under 
‘Conditions to look out for’) 
* If you take opioids to control pain.  The pain may increase when you receive Nyxoid. 
* If you use buprenorphine.  Nyxoid may not fully reverse breathing problems. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have damage to the inside of your nose as this could affect how Nyxoid 
works. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Nyxoid is not for use in children or adolescents under 14 years.  </p>
<p>Receiving Nyxoid close to giving birth </p>
<p>Tell your midwife or doctor if you have received Nyxoid close to or during labour. 
Your baby could suffer from sudden opioid withdrawal syndrome, which could be life-threatening if 
not treated. 
Watch out for the following symptoms in your baby during the first 24 hours after the baby is born:<br />
* seizures (fits) 
* crying more than usual 
* increased reflexes. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nyxoid </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving a supply of this medicine. 
If you are given Nyxoid while you are pregnant or breast-feeding, your baby should be closely 
monitored. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>After taking this medicine, you must not drive, operate machinery or engage in any other physically or 
mentally demanding activity for at least 24 hours, since the effects of opioids may recur.  </p>
<p>Nyxoid contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free. </p>         </div>"""
