<p>If you are at risk of an opioid overdose you should always carry your Nyxoid with you. Nyxoid 
works for a short time only to reverse the effects of opioids while you wait for emergency medical

appropriately trained individuals.   </p>

<p>Conditions to look out for 
* If you are physically dependent on opioids or if you have received high doses of opioids (for 
example heroin, methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone, buprenorphine or morphine).  You may get 
strong withdrawal symptoms with this medicine (see later in section 4 of this leaflet under 
 Conditions to look out for ) 
* If you take opioids to control pain.  The pain may increase when you receive Nyxoid. 
* If you use buprenorphine.  Nyxoid may not fully reverse breathing problems. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have damage to the inside of your nose as this could affect how Nyxoid 
works. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Nyxoid is not for use in children or adolescents under 14 years.  </p>
<p>Receiving Nyxoid close to giving birth </p>
<p>Tell your midwife or doctor if you have received Nyxoid close to or during labour.

not treated. 
Watch out for the following symptoms in your baby during the first 24 hours after the baby is born:<br />
* seizures (fits) 
* crying more than usual 
* increased reflexes. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Nyxoid </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving a supply of this medicine. 
If you are given Nyxoid while you are pregnant or breast-feeding, your baby should be closely 
monitored. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>After taking this medicine, you must not drive, operate machinery or engage in any other physically or 
mentally demanding activity for at least 24 hours, since the effects of opioids may recur.  </p>

guide. 
Instructions for giving Nyxoid nasal spray  </p>
<ol>
<li>Check for symptoms and response.   </li>
<li>Check for a response, to see if the person is conscious.  You can shout their name, 
gently shake their shoulders, talk loudly into their ears, rub their breastbone (sternum), 
pinch their ear or the bed of their fingernail. </li>
<li>Check airways and breathing.  Clear the mouth and nose of any blockages.  For 
10 seconds check for breathing   is the chest moving?  Can you hear breathing sounds?<br />
Can you feel breath on the cheek? </li>
<li>Check for signs of overdose, such as: no response to touch or sounds, slow uneven 
breathing or no breathing, snoring, gasping or gulping, blue or purple fingernails or lips. </li>
<li>
<p>If an overdose is suspected Nyxoid should be given. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call for an ambulance.  Nyxoid is not a substitute for emergency medical care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peel off the back of the blister from the corner to remove the nasal spray from the container.<br />
Place the nasal spray within easy reach. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay the patient on their back. Support the back of the neck and allow the head to tilt back.  Clear 
away anything blocking their nose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the nasal spray with your thumb on the bottom of the plunger and your first and middle 
fingers on either side of the nozzle.  Do not prime or test the Nyxoid nasal spray before use 
as it contains only one dose of naloxone and cannot be reused. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently insert the device nozzle in one nostril.  Press firmly on the plunger until it clicks to 
give the dose.  Remove the nasal spray nozzle from the nostril after giving the dose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the patient into the recovery position on their side with mouth open pointing towards the 
ground and stay with the patient until the emergency services arrive.  Watch for an improvement 
in the patient s breathing level, alertness and response to noise and touch.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the patient is no better within 2-3 minutes, a second dose can be given.  Be aware   even if 
they wake up, they may become unconscious again, and stop breathing.  If this happens, a 
second dose can be given immediately.  Give Nyxoid in the other nostril using a new Nyxoid 
nasal spray.  This can be done while the patient is in the recovery position.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the patient does not respond to two doses, further doses may be given (if available).  Stay 
with the patient and continue to watch for an improvement until the emergency services arrive 
who will give further treatment. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In patients who are unconscious and not breathing normally additional life-saving support should be 
given if possible.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
