<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given NYXTHRACIS: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, or if 
your child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because it feels sick, vomits or gets 
unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. </li>
</ul>
<p>Allergic reactions that may occur after treatment with NYXTHRACIS can sometimes be severe. You 
may be given an antihistamine before you are given NYXTHRACIS to reduce the risk of allergic 
reactions. </p>
<p>Other medicines and NYXTHRACIS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
You may be given antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) to help treat inhalational anthrax. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before this medicine is given to you. </p>
<p>It is not known if NYXTHRACIS can harm an unborn baby.  </p>
<p>It is not known if NYXTHRACIS passes into breast milk. You and your doctor will decide if you 
should breast-feed after receiving NYXTHRACIS. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
NYXTHRACIS may cause side effects such as headache, dizziness, fatigue and vomiting. This may 
affect your ability to drive or operate machinery. </p>
<p>NYXTHRACIS contains sorbitol (E420) 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose (a type of sugar). If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose 
intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, your doctor may decide that you (or your child) must not 
receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side 
effects. 
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your 
child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects 
such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. </p>
<p>NYXTHRACIS contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per each 6 mL vial of NYXTHRACIS, that 
is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
