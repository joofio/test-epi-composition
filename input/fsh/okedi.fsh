<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking OKEDI if:<br />
<em> You have a heart problem. Examples include an irregular heart rhythm or if you are prone 
to low blood pressure or if you are using medicines for your blood pressure. OKEDI may 
cause low blood pressure. Your dose may need to be adjusted 
* You know of any factors which would favour you having a stroke, such as high 
blood pressure, cardiovascular disorder or blood vessel problems in the brain 
* You have ever experienced involuntary movements of the tongue, mouth and face 
* You have ever had a condition whose symptoms include high temperature, muscle 
stiffness, sweating or a lowered level of consciousness (also known as Neuroleptic 
Malignant Syndrome) 
* You have Parkinson s disease 
* You have dementia<br />
</em> You know that you have had low levels of white blood cells in the past (which may or 
may not have been caused by other medicines) 
* You are diabetic 
* You have epilepsy 
* You are a man and you have ever had a prolonged or painful erection 
* You have problems controlling your body temperature or overheating 
* You have kidney problems 
* You have liver problems 
* You have an abnormally high level of the hormone prolactin in your blood or if you 
have a tumour, which is possibly dependent on prolactin 
* You or someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as 
antipsychotics have been associated with formation of blood clots. 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
before using oral risperidone or OKEDI. 
During treatment 
Dangerously low numbers of a certain type of white blood cell needed to fight infection in your 
blood has been seen very rarely with patients taking risperidone. Your doctor may therefore 
check your white blood cell counts before and during treatment. 
Even if you have previously tolerated oral risperidone, rarely allergic reactions occur after 
receiving injections of OKEDI. Seek medical attention right away if you experience a rash, 
swelling of your throat, itching, or breathing problems as these may be signs of a serious 
allergic reaction. 
OKEDI may cause you to gain weight. Significant weight gain may adversely affect your 
health. Your doctor should regularly measure your body weight. 
Diabetes mellitus or worsening of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been seen with 
patients taking OKEDI. Your doctor should therefore check for signs of high blood sugar. 
In patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus blood glucose should be monitored 
regularly. 
OKEDI commonly raises levels of a hormone called "prolactin". This may cause side effects 
such as menstrual disorders or fertility problems in women, breast swelling in men (see section 
4 Possible side effects). If such side effects occur, evaluation of the prolactin level in the blood 
is recommended. 
During an operation on the eye for cloudiness of the lens (cataract), problems may arise that 
may lead to eye damage. If you are planning to have an operation on your eye, make sure you 
tell your eye doctor that you are taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years old. 
Other medicines and OKEDI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
It is especially important to talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the 
following 
* Medicines that work on your brain such as to help you calm down (benzodiazepines) or 
some medicines for pain (opiates), medicines for allergy (some antihistamines), as 
OKEDI may increase the sedative effect of all of these. 
* Medicines that may change the electrical activity of your heart, such as medicines for 
malaria, heart rhythm problems, allergies (antihistamines), some antidepressants or 
other medicines for mental problems. 
* Medicines that cause a slow heartbeat. 
* Medicines that cause low blood potassium (such as certain diuretics). 
* Medicines to treat raised blood pressure. OKEDI can lower blood pressure 
* Medicines for Parkinson's disease (such as levodopa). 
* Medicines that increase the activity of the central nervous system 
(psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate). 
* Water tablets (diuretics) used for heart problems or swelling of parts of your body due to 
accumulation of too much fluid (such as furosemide or chlorothiazide). OKEDI taken by 
itself or with furosemide, may have an increased risk of stroke or death in elderly people 
with dementia. 
The following medicines may reduce the effect of risperidone 
* Rifampicin (a medicine for treating some infections) 
* Carbamazepine, phenytoin (medicines for epilepsy) 
* Phenobarbital. 
If you start or stop taking such medicines, you may need a different dose of risperidone. 
The following medicines may increase the effect of risperidone 
* Quinidine (used for certain types of heart disease) 
* Antidepressants (such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, tricyclic antidepressants) 
* Medicines known as beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) 
* Phenothiazines (such as medicines used to treat psychosis or to calm down) 
* Cimetidine, ranitidine (blockers of the acidity of stomach) 
* Itraconazole and ketoconazole (medicines for treating fungal infections) 
* Certain medicines used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, such as ritonavir. 
* Verapamil, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure and/or abnormal heart rhythm 
* Sertraline and fluvoxamine, medicines used to treat depression and other psychiatric 
disorders. 
If you start or stop taking such medicines, you may need a different dose of risperidone. 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
before using OKEDI. 
OKEDI with food, drink and alcohol 
You should avoid drinking alcohol when using OKEDI. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
* If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have 
a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your 
doctor will decide if you can use it. 
* The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, of mothers that have used 
risperidone in the last trimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle 
stiffness, and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in 
feeding. If your baby develops any of these symptoms you may need to contact your 
doctor. 
* OKEDI can raise your levels of a hormone called "prolactin" that may impact fertility 
(see section 4 Possible side effects). 
Driving and using machines 
Dizziness, tiredness, and vision problems may occur during treatment with OKEDI. Do not 
drive or use any tools or machines without talking to your doctor first. </p>         </div>"""

be necessary. Your doctor will decide on the dose of OKEDI that is right for you. </p>
<p>If you are currently treated with other antipsychotics than risperidone, but have taken 
risperidone in the past, you should begin taking oral risperidone with at least 6 days before 
beginning treatment with OKEDI.<br />
If you have never taken any form of risperidone, you should begin taking oral risperidone with 
at least 14 days before beginning treatment with OKEDI. The duration of the oral risperidone 
period will be determined by your physician.<br />
If you have kidney problems 
OKEDI is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe impaired kidney function. 
If you are given more OKEDI than you should 
* See a doctor right away.<br />

movements, problems standing and walking, feel dizzy due to low blood pressure, 
or have abnormal heartbeats or fits. </p>

do so by your doctor as your symptoms may return.  </p>
