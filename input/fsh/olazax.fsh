muscle stiffness and drowsiness or sleepiness. If this happens, contact your doctor at once. </p>
<p>Weight gain has been seen in patients taking Olazax. You and your doctor should check your 
weight regularly. Consider referral to a dietician or help with a diet plan if necessary. </p>
<p>High blood sugar and high levels of fat (triglycerides and cholesterol) have been seen in patients 
taking Olazax. Your doctor should do blood tests to check blood sugar and certain fat levels 
before you start taking Olazax and regularly during treatment. </p>

like these have been associated with the formation of blood clots.  </p>
