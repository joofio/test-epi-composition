  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Olumiant contains the active substance baricitinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Janus 
kinase inhibitors, which help to reduce inflammation.  </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis 
Olumiant is used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease 
of the joints, if previous therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Olumiant can be used 
alone or together with some other medicines, such as methotrexate. </p>
<p>Olumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called  Janus kinase , which is 
involved in inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Olumiant helps to reduce pain, 
stiffness and swelling in your joints, tiredness, and helps to slow damage to the bone and cartilage in 
the joints. These effects can help you to do normal daily activities and so improve the health-related 
quality of life for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>Atopic dermatitis 
Olumiant is used to treat children from the age of 2 years, adolescents and adults with moderate to 
severe atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Olumiant may be used with eczema medicines 
that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own. </p>
<p>Olumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called  Janus kinase , which is 
involved in inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Olumiant helps to improve the 
condition of your skin and reduce itching. In addition, Olumiant helps improve your sleep disturbance 
(due to itch) and overall quality of life. Olumiant has also been shown to improve symptoms of skin 
pain, anxiety, and depression associated with atopic dermatitis. </p>
<p>Alopecia areata 
Olumiant is used to treat adults with severe alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease characterized by 
inflammatory, nonscarring hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that 
can be recurrent and progressive. </p>
<p>Olumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called  Janus kinase , which is 
involved in inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Olumiant helps hair to regrow on 
scalp, face and other areas of the body impacted by the disease.  </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic 
arthritis 
Olumiant is used for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, an inflammatory 
disease of the joints, in children 2 years of age and older.  </p>
<p>Olumiant is also used for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis, an inflammatory disease of 
the joints and the places where tendons join the bone, in children 2 years of age and older. </p>
<p>Olumiant is also used for the treatment of active juvenile psoriatic arthritis, a condition that is an 
inflammatory disease of the joints often accompanied by psoriasis, in children 2 years of age and 
older. </p>
<p>Olumiant can be used alone or together with methotrexate. </p>         </div>"""

problems including heart attack and some types of cancer. Your doctor will discuss with you if 
Olumiant is appropriate for you </li>
<li>have an infection, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as 
fever, wounds, feeling more tired than usual or dental problems as these can be signs of 
infection. Olumiant can reduce your body s ability to fight infections and may make an existing 
infection worse or increase the chance of you getting a new infection. If you have diabetes or 
are older than 65 you may have an increased chance of getting infections </li>
<li>have, or have previously had, tuberculosis. You may need tests to check for tuberculosis before 
you are given Olumiant. Tell your doctor if you get persistent cough, fever, night sweats and 
weight loss during Olumiant treatment as these can be signs of tuberculosis </li>
<li>have had a herpes infection (shingles), because Olumiant may allow it to come back. Tell your 
doctor if you get painful skin rash with blisters during Olumiant treatment as these can be signs 
of shingles </li>

recent major surgery, if you use hormonal contraceptives\hormonal replacement therapy, or if a 
coagulation defect is identified in you or your close relatives). Your doctor will discuss with 
you if Olumiant is appropriate for you. Tell your doctor if you get sudden shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, chest pain or pain in upper back, swelling of the leg or arm, leg pain or 
tenderness, or redness or discoloration in the leg or arm as these can be signs of blood clots in 
the veins </li>
<li>have had diverticulitis (a type of inflammation of the large intestine) or ulcers in stomach or 
intestines (see section 4) </li>
<li>Non-melanoma skin cancer has been observed in patients taking Olumiant. Your doctor may 
recommend that you have regular skin examinations while taking Olumiant. If new skin lesions 
appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. </li>

low red blood cell count (anaemia), low white blood cell count (neutropaenia or lymphopaenia), high 
blood fat (cholesterol) or high levels of liver enzymes, to ensure that treatment with Olumiant is not 
causing problems.  </p>

If possible, children and adolescents should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Olumiant. </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years of age. </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents with alopecia areata under 18 years old, because 
there is no information on use in this disease. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Olumiant 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take, any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Olumiant if you are taking any other

with Olumiant and for at least one week after the last Olumiant treatment. You must tell your doctor if 
you become pregnant as Olumiant should not be used during pregnancy.  </p>
