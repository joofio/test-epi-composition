  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Omjjara contains the active substance momelotinib. Momelotinib is a type of medicine known as a 
protein kinase inhibitor. </p>
<p>Omjjara is used to treat enlarged spleen or other disease related symptoms in adult patients with 
myelofibrosis, a rare form of blood cancer, and moderate to severe anaemia. </p>
<p>In myelofibrosis, bone marrow is replaced by scar tissue and is classified as either: 
• primary myelofibrosis, which develops in people who have not had problems with their bone 
marrow before, or; 
• secondary myelofibrosis, which develops in people who have other blood cancers, causing their 
body to produce too many red blood cells (post polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis) or blood 
platelets, which help the blood to clot (post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis). </p>
<p>How Omjjara works </p>
<p>An enlarged spleen is one of the characteristics of myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a disorder of the 
bone marrow, in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue. The abnormal marrow can no longer 
produce enough normal blood cells and as a result the spleen becomes significantly enlarged. Omjjara 
blocks the action of certain proteins, called Janus Kinases (JAK1, JAK2) and activin A receptor, type 
1 (ACVR1) preventing the over production of cytokines and reducing inflammation. By doing so, 
Omjjara relieves the enlarged spleen, anaemia, and symptoms such as fever, night sweats, bone pain 
and weight loss caused by myelofibrosis. </p>         </div>"""

<em> if you are allergic to momelotinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you are not sure whether this applies to you, do not take Omjjara until you 
have checked with your doctor.<br />
</em> if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Tell your doctor<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Omjjara or during your treatment with 
Omjjara: 
* if you have an infection or have frequent infections — signs of an infection may include 
fever, chills, cough, breathing problems, diarrhoea, vomiting, pain or burning feeling when 
passing urine. 
* if you have had hepatitis B for a long time (chronic) as hepatitis B may become active again. 
* if you have unusual bleeding or bruising under the skin, longer than usual bleeding after your 
blood has been drawn, or bleeding from your gums — these may be signs of low levels of 
blood platelets (components that help the blood to clot), also called thrombocytopenia. 
* if you have any liver problems. Your doctor may need to prescribe a lower dose of 
Omjjara. </p>
<p>The following has been observed in another similar type of medicine used for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis: heart problems, blood clots and cancer. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
before or during treatment: 
* if you are older than 65. Patients aged 65 years and older may be at increased risk of heart 
problems including heart attack and some types of cancer. 
* if you have or have had heart problems. 
* if you have or have had cancer. 
* if you are a smoker or have smoked in the past. 
* if you have previously had blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or 
lungs (pulmonary embolism) or if you have an increased risk of developing this, for example 
if: 
* you had recent major surgery. 
* you use hormonal contraceptives/hormonal replacement therapy. 
* you or a close relative have been diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder. 
Tell your doctor immediately if you get: 
* sudden shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. 
* chest pain or pain in upper back. 
* swelling of the leg or arm. 
* leg pain or tenderness. 
* redness or discolouration in the leg or arm. 
These can be signs of blood clots in the veins. 
* if you notice any new growths on the skin or changes in existing growths. Your doctor may 
recommend that you have regular skin examinations while taking Omjjara. </p>
<p>Your doctor will discuss with you if Omjjara is appropriate for you. </p>
<p>Blood tests 
Before and during treatment, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check your blood cell levels 
(red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) and your liver function. Your doctor may adjust 
the dose or stop treatment based on the results of the blood tests. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Omjjara should not be given to children under 18 years of age, because this medicine has not been 
studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Omjjara<br />
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. This includes herbal preparations and medicines without a prescription. This is 
because Omjjara can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can 
affect the way Omjjara works. </p>
<p>It is particularly important that you mention any medicines containing any of the following active 
substances, as your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omjjara or the other medicine. </p>
<p>The following may increase the risk of side effects with Omjjara: 
* ciclosporin (used to prevent transplant rejection) </p>
<p>The following may reduce the effectiveness of Omjjara: 
* carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy and control fits or convulsions) 
* phenobarbital (used to treat epilepsy and control fits or convulsions) 
* phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy and control fits or convulsions) 
* St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product </p>
<p>Omjjara may affect other medicines: 
* rosuvastatin (a statin used to lower cholesterol) 
* sulfasalazine (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis) 
* metformin (used to lower blood sugar levels) 
* theophylline (used to treat breathing problems) 
* tizanadine (used to treat muscle spasms) 
* cyclophosphamide (used to treat cancer) </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Omjjara must not be used during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to have a baby, do not take this medicine, as it could harm your baby. Talk to your doctor for 
advice. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use highly effective contraception while 
you are taking Omjjara and you must continue to use highly effective contraception for at least 
1 week after taking your last dose. It is currently unknown if Omjjara could reduce the effectiveness of 
oral contraceptives, therefore it is recommended to add a barrier method during treatment and for at 
least 1 week after taking your last dose of Omjjara. Your doctor may ask you to take a pregnancy test 
before starting your treatment, to confirm that you are not pregnant. 
If you become pregnant while you are taking Omjjara, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Omjjara must not be used during breast-feeding. It is not known if it passes into breast milk. A risk 
to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>It is unknown if Omjjara affects male or female fertility in humans. Omjjara had effects on fertility in 
animals. If you or your partner are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before, or while 
taking, this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Omjjara may have side effects that affect your ability to drive. If you feel dizzy or have blurred vision, 
do not drive or operate machines until these side effects have gone away. </p>
<p>Omjjara contains lactose and sodium 
Omjjara contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""
