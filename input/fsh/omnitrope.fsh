  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Omnitrope is a recombinant human growth hormone (also called somatropin). It has the same structure 
as natural human growth hormone which is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your 
fat and muscle tissues to develop in the right amounts. It is recombinant meaning it is not made from 
human or animal tissue.
In children Omnitrope is used to treat the following growth disturbances:</p>
<p>If you are not growing properly and you do not have enough of your own growth hormone. </p>
<p>If you have Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder in girls that can affect 
growth   your doctor will have told you if you have this.</p>
<p>If you have chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency. As kidneys lose their ability to function 
normally, this can affect growth.</p>
<p>If you were small or too light at birth. Growth hormone can help you grow taller if you have not 
been able to catch up or maintain normal growth by 4 years of age or later.</p>
<p>If you have Prader-Willi syndrome (a chromosomal disorder). Growth hormone will help you 
grow taller if you are still growing, and will also improve your body composition. Your 
excessive fat will decrease and your reduced muscle mass will improve.
In adults Omnitrope is used to</p>
<p>treat persons with pronounced growth hormone deficiency. This can start during either adult life 
or it can continue from childhood.
If you have been treated with Omnitrope for growth hormone deficiency during childhood, your 
growth hormone status will be retested after completion of growth. If severe growth hormone 
deficiency is confirmed, your doctor will propose continuation of Omnitrope treatment.
You should only be given this medicine by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone 
treatment and who has confirmed your diagnosis.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of 
Omnitrope.</p>
<p>and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour (cancer). Tumours must be inactive and you 
must have finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Omnitrope.</p>
<p>and tell your doctor if Omnitrope has been prescribed to stimulate growth but you have already 
stopped growing (closed epiphyses).</p>
<p>if you are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart surgery, abdominal 
surgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). If you are about to 
have, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and 
remind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth hormone.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using Omnitrope.</p>
<p>If you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids, you should consult your doctor 
regularly, as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose.</p>
<p>If you are at risk of developing diabetes, your doctor will need to monitor your blood sugar 
level during therapy with somatropin.</p>
<p>If you have diabetes, you should closely monitor your blood sugar level during treatment with 
somatropin and discuss the results with your doctor to determine whether you need to change 
the dose of your medicines to treat diabetes.</p>
<p>After starting somatropin treatment some patients may need to start thyroid hormone 
replacement.</p>
<p>If you are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones it may become necessary to adjust your 
thyroid hormone dose.</p>
<p>If you have raised intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, 
visual disturbances or vomiting) you should inform your doctor about it.</p>
<p>If you walk with a limp or if you start to limp during your growth hormone treatment, you 
should inform your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are receiving somatropin for growth hormone deficiency following a previous tumour 
(cancer), you should be examined regularly for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer.</p>
<p>If you experience worsening abdominal pain you should inform your doctor.</p>
<p>Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly persons may be more sensitive to the 
action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop side effects. </p>
<p>Omnitrope may cause an inflammation of the pancreas, which causes severe pain in the 
abdomen and back. Contact your doctor if you or your child develops stomach ache after taking 
Omnitrope.</p>
<p>An increase in sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis) may progress in any child during 
rapid growth. During treatment with somatropin, your doctor will check you (or your child) for 
signs of scoliosis.
Children with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency </p>
<p>Your doctor should examine your kidney function and your growth rate before starting 
somatropin. Medical treatment for your kidney should be continued. Somatropin treatment 
should be stopped at kidney transplantation.
Children with Prader-Willi syndrome </p>
<p>Your doctor will give you diet restrictions to follow to control your weight.</p>
<p>Your doctor will assess you for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea (where your 
breathing is interrupted during sleep), or respiratory infection before you start treatment with 
somatropin.</p>
<p>During treatment with somatropin, tell your doctor if you show signs of upper airway 
obstruction (including starting to snore or worsening of snoring), your doctor will need to 
examine you and may interrupt treatment with somatropin.</p>
<p>During treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of scoliosis, a type of spinal deformity.</p>
<p>During treatment, if you develop a lung infection, tell your doctor so that he can treat the 
infection.
Children born small or too light at birth</p>
<p>If you were too small or too light at birth and are aged between 9 and 12 years, ask your doctor 
for specific advice relating to puberty and treatment with this medicine.</p>
<p>Treatment should be continued until you have stopped growing.</p>
<p>Your doctor will check your blood sugar and insulin levels before the start of treatment and 
every year during treatment.
Other medicines and Omnitrope
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
In particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following 
medicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omnitrope or of the other medicines:</p>
<p>medicine to treat diabetes, </p>
<p>thyroid hormones,</p>
<p>medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants), </p>
<p>ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune system after transplantation),</p>
<p>oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones, </p>
<p>synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids). 
Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of somatropin.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not use Omnitrope if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.
If you are pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.
The dose depends on your size, the condition for which you are being treated and how well growth 
hormone works for you. Everyone is different. Your doctor will advise you about your individualised 
dose of Omnitrope in milligrams (mg) from either your body weight in kilograms (kg) or your body 
surface area calculated from your height and weight in square metres (m2), as well as your treatment 
schedule. Do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor. 
The recommended dose is for: 
Children with growth hormone deficiency: 
0.025 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses 
can be used. When growth hormone deficiency continues into adolescence, Omnitrope should be 
continued until completion of physical development. 
Children with Turner syndrome: 
0.045 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day. 
Children with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency: 
0.045 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m2 body surface area per day. Higher doses may be 
necessary if the rate of growth is too low. Dosage adjustment may be necessary after 6 months of 
treatment. 
Children with Prader-Willi syndrome: 
0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. The daily dosage should 
not exceed 2.7 mg. Treatment should not be used in children who have almost stopped growing after 
puberty. 
Children born smaller or lighter than expected and with growth disturbance: 
0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m2 body surface area per day. It is important to continue 
treatment until final height is reached. Treatment should be discontinued after the first year if you are 
not responding or if you have reached your final height and stopped growing. 
Adults with growth hormone deficiency: 
If you continue Omnitrope after treatment during childhood you should start with 0.2 0.5 mg per day.
This dosage should be gradually increased or decreased according to blood test results as well as 
clinical response and side effects.
If your growth hormone deficiency starts during adult life you should start with 0.15 0.3 mg per day. 
This dosage should be gradually increased according to blood test results as well as clinical response 
and side effects. The daily maintenance dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require 
higher doses than men. Dosage should be monitored every 6 months. Persons above 60 years should 
start with a dose of 0.1 0.2 mg per day which should be slowly increased according to individual 
requirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose seldom exceeds 0.5 
mg per day. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor.
Injecting Omnitrope
Inject your growth hormone at about the same time every day. Bedtime is a good time because it is 
easy to remember. It is also natural to have a higher level of growth hormone at night.
Omnitrope is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short injection 
needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. Most people do their injections into their thigh or their 
bottom. Do your injection in the place you have been shown by your doctor. Fatty tissue of the skin 
can shrink at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place for your injection each 
time. This gives your skin and the area under your skin time to recover from one injection before it 
gets another one in the same place.
Your doctor should have already shown you how to use Omnitrope. Always inject Omnitrope exactly 
as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How to inject Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml
The following instructions explain how to inject Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml yourself. Please read the 
instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor will show you how to inject 
Omnitrope. Do not attempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and 
requirements for the injection.
-
After reconstitution, Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin. 
-
Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless.
-
Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy (local reduction of fatty 
tissue under the skin).
Preparation
Collect necessary items before you begin:
-
a vial with Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml powder for solution for injection.
-
a vial with solvent (liquid) for Omnitrope 1.3 mg/ml.
-
a sterile, disposable syringe (e.g. 2 ml syringe) and needle (e.g. 
0.33 mm x 12.7 mm) for withdrawing the solvent from the vial (not 
supplied in the pack).
-
a sterile, disposable syringe of appropriate size (e.g. 1 ml syringe) 
and injection needle (e.g. 0.25 mm x 8 mm) for subcutaneous 
injection (not supplied in the pack).
-
2 cleansing swabs (not supplied in the pack).
Wash your hands before you continue with the next steps.
Reconstituting Omnitrope
-
Remove the protective caps from the two vials in the box. With a 
cleansing swab, disinfect the rubber membranes of both the 
powder-filled and the solvent-filled vial.
-
Take the vial with solvent and the sterile, disposable syringe (e.g. 
2 ml syringe) and needle (e.g. 0.33 mm x 12.7 mm). Push the 
needle fitted to the syringe through the rubber membrane.
-
Turn the vial with the solvent upside down and withdraw all the 
solvent from the vial.
-
Take the vial with the powder and push the needle through the 
rubber membrane of the vial. Inject the solvent slowly. Aim the 
stream of liquid against the glass wall in order to avoid foam. 
Remove the syringe and needle.
-
Gently swirl the reconstituted vial until the content is completely 
dissolved. Do not shake.
-
If the solution is cloudy (and the cloudiness does not disappear 
within ten minutes) or contains particles, it should not be used. The 
contents must be clear and colourless.
-
Use the solution immediately.
Measuring the dose of Omnitrope to be injected
-
Take the sterile, disposable syringe of appropriate size (e.g. 1 ml 
syringe) and injection needle (e.g. 0.25 mm x 8 mm).
-
Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial with the 
reconstituted solution.
-
Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand.
-
Be sure that the tip of the syringe is in the Omnitrope reconstituted 
solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger.
-
Pull back on the plunger slowly and withdraw just a bit more than 
the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.
-
Hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up and remove 
the syringe from the vial.
-
Check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull 
the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle 
pointing upwards, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger 
slowly back to the correct dose.
-
Inspect the reconstituted solution visually prior to administration. 
Do not use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles. You 
are now ready to inject the dose. 
Injecting Omnitrope
-
Select the site of injection. The best sites for injection are tissues 
with a layer of fat between skin and muscle, such as the thigh or 
belly (except the navel or waistline).
-
Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and 
that you change the places where you inject, as you have been 
taught.
-
Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol 
swab. Wait for the area to dry.
-
With one hand, pitch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand, 
hold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the 
pinched skin at an angle of 45  to 90 . After the needle is in, 
remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the 
syringe barrel. Pull back the plunger very slightly with one hand. If 
blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. 
Do not inject into this site; withdraw the needle and repeat this step. 
Inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently.
-
Pull the needle straight out of the skin. 
After injecting
-
After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or 
sterile gauze for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site.
-
The residual solution, vials, and injection materials intended for 
single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringes safely in a 
closed container.
If you use more Omnitrope than you should
If you inject much more than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Your 
blood sugar level could fall too low and later rise too high. You might feel shaky, sweaty, sleepy or 
 not yourself , and you might faint.
If you forget to use Omnitrope
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. It is best to use your growth hormone 
regularly. If you forget to use a dose, have your next injection at the usual time the next day. Keep a 
note of any missed injections and tell your doctor at your next check-up.
If you stop using Omnitrope
Ask for advice from your doctor before you stop using Omnitrope.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

The skin around the injection area can get uneven or lumpy, but this should not happen if you inject in 
a different place each time.
There have been rare cases of sudden death in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, no link 
has been made between these cases and treatment with Omnitrope.
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calv -Perthes disease may be considered by your doctor if 
discomfort or pain in the hip or knee is experienced whilst being treated with Omnitrope.
Other possible side effects related to your treatment with growth hormone may include the following:
You (or your child) may experience a high blood sugar or reduced levels of thyroid hormone. This can 
be tested by your doctor and if necessary your doctor will prescribe the adequate treatment. Rarely, an 
inflammation of the pancreas has been reported in patients treated with growth hormone.
Reporting of side effects
