are proteins that recognise and bind specifically to certain target proteins in the body. Omvoh works 
by attaching to and blocking a protein in the body called IL-23 (interleukin-23), which is involved in 
inflammation. By blocking the action of IL-23, Omvoh reduces inflammation and other symptoms 
associated with ulcerative colitis. </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis, 
you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough or cannot tolerate these 
medicines, you may be given Omvoh to reduce signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis such as 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urgency and rectal bleeding. </p>         </div>"""

it. 
Vaccinations 
Your doctor will check to see if you need any vaccinations before starting treatment. Tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. Some types 
of vaccines (live vaccines) should not be given while using Omvoh. </li>

or throat, trouble breathing * dizziness * sensation of throat tightening or chest 
tightness. </p>
<p>Liver blood test 
Your doctor will conduct blood tests before starting and during treatment with Omvoh to check if 
your liver is functioning normally. If blood tests are abnormal, your doctor might interrupt therapy 
with Omvoh and do additional tests on your liver to determine the cause. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Omvoh is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Omvoh

- if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
- if you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. Some types of vaccines (live 
vaccines) should not be given while using Omvoh. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Omvoh in pregnancy. The 
effects of Omvoh in pregnant women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, 
you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use effective contraception while using Omvoh 
and for at least 10 weeks after the last Omvoh dose. </p>

<p>Omvoh contains sodium 
This medicine contains 60 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 300 mg dose. 
This is equivalent to 3 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Before Omvoh is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that might contain sodium. Talk to your 
doctor if you are on a low salt diet. </p>         </div>"""

4 weeks. The maintenance dose of 200 mg will be given by using 2 injections each containing 
100 mg of Omvoh. 
If you lose response after receiving the maintenance dose of Omvoh, your doctor may decide 
to give you 3 doses of Omvoh by intravenous infusions. 
Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to switch to subcutaneous injections. 
During maintenance therapy you and your doctor or nurse should decide if you should inject 
Omvoh yourself after training in subcutaneous injection technique. It is important not to try to 
inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or nurse. Your doctor or nurse will 
offer the necessary training. </li>
