Warnings and precautions
Reversing the effect of a factor Xa inhibitor with Ondexxya may increase the risk of blood clots.
After treatment with Ondexxya, your doctor will decide when to restart anticoagulant therapy.
An independent pro-coagulant effect of andexanet alfa may pose an additional risk of developing 
thrombosis.
If you suffer side effects when you are being given Ondexxya by infusion (drip), your doctor may
decide to slow down or pause your treatment. Your doctor may give you an antihistamine medicine
to help with any side effects (see section 4).
If a surgery is planned for you which requires anticoagulation with heparin, Ondexxya should be 
avoided.
Children and adolescents
There is no information on the use of Ondexxya in children and adolescents.
Other medicines and Ondexxya
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take, any other medicines.
This medicine has been designed to reverse the effects of factor Xa inhibitor medicines only. It is
unlikely that Ondexxya will influence the effect of other medicines or that other medicines will
influence Ondexxya.
Ondexxya-treatment should be avoided if anticoagulation with heparin might become necessary. 
Ondexxya causes unresponsiveness to heparin.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to
have a baby.
Ondexxya is not recommended during pregnancy or if you have the potential to become pregnant 
and are not using birth control.
Do not breast-feed your child while you are taking this medicine. It is unknown if andexanet alfa is
excreted in human milk.
Driving and using machines
This medicine is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.</p>         </div>"""

This medicine has been given  conditional approval . This means that there is more evidence to 
come about this medicine.
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicine at least every year
and this leaflet will be updated as necessary.
Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site:

<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only.
Andexanet has not been shown to be effective for, and is not indicated for, the treatment of bleeding 
related to any FXa inhibitor other than rivaroxaban or apixaban. Also, it will not reverse the effects of
non-FXa inhibitors.
Dosage and administration
Andexanet alfa is administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus at a target rate of approximately
30 mg/min over 15 (low dose) or 30 minutes (high dose), immediately followed by administration of a 
continuous infusion of 4 mg (low dose) or 8 mg (high dose) per minute for 120 minutes (see table 1).

Dosage recommendations have been defined from the effects of andexanet alfa in healthy
volunteers administered a direct FXa inhibitor and from the ability to reverse the levels of anti-
FXa activity. The dosage was used in a study in patients with acute major bleeding.
Reversal of apixaban
The recommended dose regimen of andexanet alfa is based on the dose of apixaban the patient is
taking at the time of anticoagulation reversal, as well as on the time since the patient s last dose of
apixaban (see table 2). If the strength of the last dose of anticoagulant or the interval between the 
last dosage and the bleeding episode are unknown, no dose recommendation is available.
Measurement of baseline anti-FXa-level should support the clinical decision of starting treatment
(if level is available in an acceptable timely frame).

Reversal of rivaroxaban
The recommended dose regimen of andexanet alfa is based on the dose of rivaroxaban the patient is
taking at the time of anticoagulation reversal, as well as on the time since the patient s last dose of
rivaroxaban (see table 3). If the strength of the last dose of anticoagulant or the interval between the 
last dosage and the bleeding episode are unknown, no dose recommendation is available.

Patients being treated with FXa inhibitor therapy have underlying disease states that predispose
them to thromboembolic events. Reversing FXa inhibitor therapy exposes patients to the
thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. To reduce this risk, resumption of anticoagulant
therapy should be considered as soon as medically appropriate.
Handling instructions
Andexanet alfa is to be reconstituted and the 10 mg/mL solution then transferred without further 
dilution to sterile large volume syringes in case a syringe pump is used for administration or to suitable
empty IV bags comprised of polyolefin (PO) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material. Prior to
administration by IV infusion a 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) or equivalent low
protein- binding filter should be used.
For reconstituted solutions, chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for at
least eight hours at 25 C. From a microbiological point of view, once opened, the product should
be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are
the responsibility of the user.
Reconstitution
Before starting reconstitution, you will need the following:</p>
