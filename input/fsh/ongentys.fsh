<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or 
cravings to behave in ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or 
temptation to carry out certain activities that could harm you or others. These behaviours are called 
 impulse control disorders  and can include: addictive gambling, an abnormally high sex drive or an 
increased preoccupation with sexual thoughts or feelings. Behaviours such as these have been reported 
in patients using other medicines for Parkinsons s disease.<br />
Your doctor may need to review your treatments. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents under the age of 18 years must not take this medicine. It has not been studied 
in these age groups since treatment of Parkinson s disease is not relevant in children and adolescents.   </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ongentys 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines for depression or anxiety such as venlafaxine, maprotiline and desipramine. Taking 
Ongentys with these medicines may increase the risk of side effects. Your doctor may need to 
adjust your treatment; </li>
<li>safinamide used for Parkinson s disease. There is no experience taking Ongentys and 
safinamide together. Your doctor may need to adjust your treatment; </li>
<li>medicines to treat asthma such as rimiterole or isoprenaline. Ongentys may increase their effect; </li>
<li>medicines used to treat allergic reactions such as adrenaline. Ongentys may increase their effect; </li>
<li>medicines used to treat heart failure such as dobutamine, dopamine or dopexamine. Ongentys 
may increase their effects; </li>
<li>medicines for high cholesterol such as rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin or pravastatin 
Ongentys may increase their effects;  </li>
<li>medicines that affect the immune system such as methotrexate. Ongentys may increase its 
effect; </li>
<li>medicines containing quinidine, a medicine used to treat abnormal heart rhythms or malaria. 
Taking Ongentys and quinidine together, i.e. at the same time, may decrease the effect of 
Ongentys. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Ongentys is not recommended if you are pregnant. You should use effective contraception if you 
might become pregnant. </p>
<p>It is not known if Ongentys passes into breast milk in humans. Since the risk to the baby/infant cannot 
be excluded, you should stop breast-feeding during treatment with Ongentys.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ongentys taken with levodopa may make you feel light-headed, dizzy, or sleepy. 
Do not drive or operate machinery if you experience any of these side effects. </p>

- Lactose: If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your 
doctor before taking this medicine.
