  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Ontruzant contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal 
antibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an 
antigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts on 
the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When Ontruzant binds to HER2 it 
stops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe Ontruzant for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: 
* You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2. * You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) with 
high levels of HER2. Ontruzant may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy 
medicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be 
prescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in combination with 
medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of HER2 and hormone 
receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex 
hormones). 
* You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with the 
other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin. </p>         </div>"""

* you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen treatment. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Your doctor will closely supervise your therapy. </p>
<p>Heart checks 
Treatment with Ontruzant (alone or with a taxane) may affect the heart, especially if you have ever 
used an anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat cancer). 
The effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function will be 
checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with 
Ontruzant. If you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your 
heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment 
for heart failure or you may have to stop Ontruzant treatment. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Ontruzant if: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high 
blood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood 
pressure medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines 
used to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle 
and increase the risk of heart problems with Ontruzant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you suffer from breathlessness., especially if you are currently using a taxane. Ontruzant can 
cause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you are 
already breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment have 
died when they were given Ontruzant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you receive Ontruzant with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an 
aromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient 
information leaflets for these products. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Ontruzant is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ontruzant 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>It may take up to 7 months for Ontruzant to be removed from the body. Therefore, you should tell your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Ontruzant if you start any new medicine in the 7 months 
after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
* If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. 
* You should use effective contraception during treatment with Ontruzant and for at least 7 months 
after treatment has ended. 
* Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Ontruzant during pregnancy. In 
rare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby within 
the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving Ontruzant. This condition may be 
harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not developing fully 
resulting in foetal death. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed your baby during Ontruzant therapy and for 7 months after the last dose, as 
Ontruzant may pass to your baby through your breast milk. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Ontruzant may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. If during treatment you 
experience symptoms such as dizziness, sleepiness, chills or fever, you should not drive or use 
machines until these symptoms disappear. </p>
<p>Sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
sodium-free. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Before starting the treatment, your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only 
patients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Ontruzant. Ontruzant should only be given 
by a doctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The 
dose of Ontruzant depends on your body weight. </p>
<p>Ontruzant is given as an infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion,  drip ). This intravenous 
formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous infusion only. </p>
<p>The first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health 
professional while it is being given in case you have any side effects (see section 2 under  Warnings 
and precautions ). If the first dose is well tolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes. The 
number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. Your doctor will 
discuss this with you. </p>
<p>In order to prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine 
being prepared and given is Ontruzant (trastuzumab) and not another trastuzumab-containing product 
(e.g. trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab deruxtecan). </p>
<p>Ontruzant is given every 3 weeks for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic 
gastric cancer. Ontruzant may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. </p>
<p>If you stop using Ontruzant 
Do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the 
right time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your 
medicine work as well as it can. </p>
<p>It may take up to 7 months for Ontruzant to be removed from your body. Therefore, your doctor may 
decide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. </p>

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, Ontruzant can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of these 
side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. </p>
<p>During an Ontruzant infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very 
common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick 
(nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing 
difficulties, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or 
irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these symptoms can 
be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>These effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion ( drip  into your vein) and during the 
first few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a 
health care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion 
and for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or 
stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion may be 
continued after the symptoms improve. </p>
<p>Occasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, 
contact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. </p>
<p>Serious side effects </p>
<p>Other side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Ontruzant, not just related to an infusion. 
Tell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects: </p>
<ul>
<li>Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has 
stopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to heart 
failure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. This can lead to 
symptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid retention 
(swelling) in the legs or arms, palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart beat) (see section 2, 
 Heart checks ). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your 
doctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment 
characterized by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of calcium). 
Symptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and confusion), 
heart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, vomiting or 
diarrhoea and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with Ontruzant has finished, you 
should see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with Ontruzant. </p>
