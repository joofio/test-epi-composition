elsewhere in the body). It can be used in adults and in adolescents 12 years of age and older. </p>
<p>Opdualag contains two active substances: nivolumab and relatlimab. Both active substances are 
monoclonal antibodies, proteins designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the 
body. Nivolumab attaches to a target protein called PD 1. Relatlimab attaches to a target protein called 
LAG-3. PD 1 and LAG-3 can switch off the activity of T cells (a type of white blood cell that forms part of the 
immune system, the body s natural defences). By attaching to the two proteins, nivolumab and 
relatlimab block their actions and prevent them from switching off your T cells. This helps increase 
the T cell activity against the melanoma cancer cells. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you get Opdualag as it may cause: 
* Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of 
inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). 
* Diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or inflammation of the intestines (colitis) with 
symptoms such as stomach pain and mucus or blood in stool. 
* Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). Signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include abnormal 
liver function tests, eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain in the right side of your stomach area, 
or tiredness. 
* Inflammation of or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal 
kidney function tests, or decrease in amount of urine. 
* Problems with your hormone producing glands (including the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal 
glands), which may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms that these glands are not 
working properly may include fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight change or headache and 
visual disturbances. 
* Diabetes including a serious, sometimes life-threatening problem due to acid in the blood 
produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis). Symptoms may include feeling more hungry or 
thirsty than usual, need to urinate more often, weight loss, feeling tired or having difficulty 
thinking clearly, breath that smells sweet or fruity, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a 
different odour to your urine or sweat, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, and deep or fast 
breathing. 
* Inflammation of the skin that can lead to severe skin reaction (known as toxic epidermal 
necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Signs and symptoms of severe skin reaction may 
include rash, itching, and peeling of the skin (possibly fatal). 
* Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis). Signs and symptoms may include chest pain, 
irregular and/or rapid heartbeat, fatigue, swelling in the ankles or shortness of breath. 
* Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A rare disease in which your immune system makes too 
many otherwise normal infection-fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. Symptoms 
may include enlarged liver and/or spleen, skin rash, swollen lymph glands, breathing problems, 
easy bruising, kidney abnormalities, and heart problems. 
* Solid organ transplant rejection. 
* Graft-versus-host disease after stem cell transplantation (where the transplanted cells from a 
donor attack your own cells). If you have received one of these transplants, your doctor will 
consider whether you should receive treatment with Opdualag. Graft-versus-host disease can be 
severe and can lead to death. 
* Infusion reactions, which may include shortness of breath, itching or rash, dizziness or fever. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or if they get worse. Do not 
try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. Your doctor may 
* give you other medicines to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, 
* skip your next dose of Opdualag, 
* or stop your treatment with Opdualag altogether. 
Please note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed and may develop weeks or months 
after your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have 
blood tests during your treatment. </p>
<p>Check with your doctor or nurse before you are given Opdualag if: 
* you have an active autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); 
* you have melanoma of the eye; 
* you have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain; 
* you have been taking medicines to suppress your immune system. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Opdualag should not be used in children below 12 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Opdualag 
Before you are given Opdualag, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that suppress your 
immune system, such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
Opdualag. However, once you are treated with Opdualag, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to 
reduce any possible side effects that you may have during your treatment. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or are planning to take any other medicines. Do 
not take any other medicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Do not use Opdualag if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically tells you to. The effects of 
Opdualag in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substances, nivolumab 
and relatlimab, could harm an unborn baby. 
* You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with Opdualag and for at least 
5 months following the last dose of Opdualag, if you are a woman who could become pregnant. 
* If you become pregnant while using Opdualag tell your doctor. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Opdualag can pass into breast milk and affect a baby that is breast-fed. Talk to 
your doctor about the benefits and risks before breast-feeding during or after treatment with Opdualag. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Opdualag has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines; however, use caution when 
performing these activities until you are sure that Opdualag does not adversely affect you. </p>
<p>Patient card 
You will also find key messages from this package leaflet on the patient card you have been given by 
your doctor. It is important that you keep this patient card at all times and show it to your partner or 
caregivers. </p>         </div>"""
