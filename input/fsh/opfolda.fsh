Opfolda is a medicine that is used in the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease in adults. This 
medicine contains the active substance ‘miglustat’. </p>
<p>What it is used for 
Opfolda is always used with another medicine called ‘cipaglucosidase alfa’, a type of enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT). It is therefore very important that you also read the package leaflet of 
cipaglucosidase alfa.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>How Opfolda works 
People with Pompe disease have low levels of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This 
enzyme helps control levels of glycogen (a type of carbohydrate) in the body. </p>
<p>In Pompe disease, high levels of glycogen build up in the muscles of the body. This keeps muscles, 
such as the muscles that help you walk, the muscles under the lungs that help you breathe, and the 
heart muscle, from working properly. </p>
<p>Opfolda binds to cipaglucosidase alfa during treatment. This makes the shape of cipaglucosidase alfa 
more stable, so it can be more easily absorbed from the blood by the muscle cells that are affected by 
Pompe disease. When in the cells, cipaglucosidase alfa works like GAA to help break down glycogen 
and control its levels. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Opfolda. </p>
<p>Look out for serious side effects 
Opfolda is used together with cipaglucosidase alfa, a type of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), so 
you should also read the package leaflet of cipaglucosidase alfa. These medicines can cause side 
effects that you need to tell your doctor about straight away. This includes allergic reactions. Signs of 
allergic reactions are listed in section 4 ‘Allergic reactions’. These can be severe and may happen 
when you are being given the medicine or during the hours after. </p>
<p>Tell a doctor or nurse immediately if you are experiencing infusion-related or allergic reactions or 
think you may be experiencing them. Inform your doctor or nurse if you have ever had any such 
reaction with another ERT before you are given Opfolda.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years old. This is because the effects 
of Opfolda in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa in this age group are not known. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Opfolda 
Tell a doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used, or will be using any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, do 
not take this medicine but talk to your doctor or pharmacist immediately for advice.  </p>
<p>There is no experience with the use of Opfolda in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa during 
pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of taking these medicines. </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take Opfolda or receive cipaglucosidase alfa if you are pregnant. Be sure to tell your doctor 
immediately if you get pregnant, think that you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to become 
pregnant. There may be risks to the unborn baby. </li>
<li>Opfolda in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa should not be given to women who are 
breast-feeding. A decision will need to be made whether to stop treatment or to stop 
breast-feeding. </li>
</ul>

It is advised that female patients must use reliable birth control methods prior to, while using these 
medicines, and for 4 weeks after stopping both medicines. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines

the package leaflet of cipaglucosidase alfa, as that medicine may have an impact. </p>         </div>"""
