<p>Optruma is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Optruma reduces the 
risk of vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. A reduction in the risk of hip 
fractures has not been shown. </p>
<p>How Optruma works </p>
<p>Optruma belongs to a group of non-hormonal medicines called Selective Oestrogen Receptor 
Modulators (SERMs). When a woman reaches the menopause, the level of the female sex hormone 
oestrogen goes down. Optruma mimics some of the helpful effects of oestrogen after the menopause.  </p>
<p>Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and fragile - this disease is especially 
common in women after the menopause. Although it may have no symptoms at first, osteoporosis 
makes you more likely to break bones, especially in your spine, hips and wrists and may cause back 
pain, loss of height and a curved back. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you are being treated or have been treated for blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), 
in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or in the eyes (retinal vein thrombosis). </li>
<li>If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to raloxifene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </li>
<li>If there is still a possibility that you can get pregnant, Optruma could harm your unborn child. </li>
<li>If you have liver disease (examples of liver disease include cirrhosis, mild hepatic impairment 
or cholestatic jaundice). </li>
<li>If you have severe kidney problems. </li>
<li>If you have any unexplained vaginal bleeding. This must be investigated by your doctor. </li>
<li>If you have active uterine cancer, as there is insufficient experience of Optruma use in women 
with this disease. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you take Optruma. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are immobilised for some time such as being wheel-chair bound, needing to be admitted 
to a hospital or having to stay in bed while recovering from an operation or an unexpected 
illness as these may increase your risk of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism or retinal vein thrombosis). </li>
<li>If you have had a cerebrovascular accident (e.g. stroke), or if your doctor has told you that you 
are at high risk of having one. </li>
<li>If you have liver disease </li>
<li>If you are suffering from breast cancer, as there is insufficient experience of Optruma use in 
women with this disease. </li>
<li>If you are receiving oral oestrogen therapy. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is unlikely that Optruma will cause vaginal bleeding. So any vaginal bleeding while you take 
Optruma is unexpected. You should have this investigated by your doctor. </p>
<p>Optruma does not treat postmenopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes. </p>
<p>Optruma lowers total cholesterol and LDL ("bad") cholesterol. In general, it does not change 
triglycerides or HDL ("good") cholesterol. However, if you have taken oestrogen in the past and had 
extreme elevations in triglycerides, you should talk to your doctor before taking Optruma.   </p>
<p>Optruma contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to lactose, a type of sugar, contact 
your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Optruma<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>If you are taking digitalis medicines for your heart or anticoagulants like warfarin to thin your blood, 
your doctor may need to adjust your dose of these medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking cholestyramine which is mainly used as lipid-lowering medicine, 
because Optruma may not work as well. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Optruma is for use only by postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women who could still 
have a baby. Optruma could harm your unborn child. 
Do not take Optruma if you are breast-feeding as it might be excreted in mother's milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Optruma has no or negligible effects on driving or using machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The tablets are for oral use. 
Swallow the tablet whole. If you wish you may take a glass of water with it. Do not break or crush the 
tablet before taking it. A broken or crushed tablet may taste bad and there is a possibility that you will

<p>Your doctor will tell you how long you should continue to take Optruma. The doctor may also advise 
you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements. </p>
<p>If you take more Optruma than you should 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist. If you take more Optruma than you should you could have leg cramps 
and dizziness. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Optruma 
Take a tablet as soon as you remember and then continue as before. Do not take a double dose to make 
up for a forgotten tablet dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Optruma 
You should talk to your doctor first. 
It is important that you continue taking Optruma for as long as your doctor prescribes the medicine,
