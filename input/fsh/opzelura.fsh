<p>Opzelura is used on the skin to treat vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 
12 years. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease, where the body’s immune system attacks the cells that 
produce the skin pigment melanin. This causes a loss of melanin, leading to patches of pale pink or 
white skin. In vitiligo, ruxolitinib reduces the immune system’s activity against the melanin-producing 
cells, allowing the skin to produce pigment and regain its normal colour.  </p>         </div>"""

- if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Opzelura. </p>
<p>Opzelura is not for use on the lips, in the eyes, mouth or vagina. If cream accidentally gets into these 
areas, thoroughly wipe off and/or rinse off the cream with water. </p>
<p>Children under 12 years 
Do not give Opzelura to children younger than 12 years because it has not been studied in this age 
group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Opzelura 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Using Opzelura at the same time as other medicines on the affected skin is not recommended, as it has 
not been studied. </p>
<p>After applying Opzelura, wait at least 2 hours before applying other medicines, sunscreen or body 
creams/oils to the same skin area. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Opzelura should not be used by pregnant or breast-feeding women as this has not been investigated. If 
you are a woman of childbearing age, you should use an effective contraception during treatment and 
during 4 weeks after applying Opzelura for the last time. </p>
<p>It is not known if ruxolitinib passes into breast milk after applying it to the skin. The effects of this 
medicine in breastfed infants are unknown; therefore, Opzelura should not be used if you are 
breast-feeding or planning to breastfeed. You may start breast-feeding approximately four weeks after 
applying Opzelura for the last time. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Opzelura is unlikely to have an effect on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Opzelura contains propylene glycol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, methyl parahydroxybenzoate, 
propyl parahydroxybenzoate and butylated hydroxytoluene 
- This medicine contains 150 mg propylene glycol (E1520) in each gram of cream, which may 
cause skin irritation. 
- Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis). 
- Methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl parahydroxybenzoate may cause allergic 
reactions (possibly delayed). 
- Butylated hydroxytoluene (E321) may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or 
irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Duration of use 
Your doctor will decide how long you should use the cream for. 
A minimum duration of 6 months is recommended but satisfactory treatment may require over 
12 months. If you achieve satisfactory repigmentation of treated areas, consult your doctor to discuss if 
treatment of those areas could be stopped. Consult your doctor if you experience loss of 
repigmentation after stopping treatment. </p>
