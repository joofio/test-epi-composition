  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>ORENCIA contains the active substance abatacept, a protein produced in cell cultures. ORENCIA 
lessens the immune system's attack on normal tissues by interfering with the immune cells (called T 
lymphocytes) that contribute to the development of rheumatoid arthritis. ORENCIA selectively 
modulates the activation of T cells involved in the immune systems  inflammatory response. </p>
<p>ORENCIA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis in adults and also polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years of age and older. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term progressive systemic disease that, if untreated, can lead to serious 
consequences, such as joint destruction, increased disability and impairment of daily activities. In 
people with rheumatoid arthritis the body's own immune system attacks normal body tissues, leading 
to pain and swelling of the joints. This can cause joint damage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 
everyone differently. In most people, joint symptoms develop gradually over several years. However, 
in some, RA may progress rapidly and yet other people may have RA for a limited period of time and 
then enter a period of remission. RA is usually a chronic (long-term), progressive disease. This means, 
even if you re on treatment, whether or not you re still having symptoms, RA could be continuing to 
damage your joints. By finding the right treatment plan for you, you may be able to slow down this 
disease process, which may help reduce long-term joint damage, as well as pain and fatigue and 
improve your overall quality of life. </p>
<p>ORENCIA is used to treat moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis when you do not respond 
well enough to treatment with other disease-modifying medicines or with another group of medicines 
called 'tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers'. It is used in combination with a medicine called 
methotrexate. 
ORENCIA can also be used with methotrexate to treat highly active and progressive rheumatoid 
arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. </p>
<p>Psoriatic Arthritis 
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis, an 
inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you may be given ORENCIA to: 
* Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. 
* Slow down the damage to your bones and joints. 
* Improve your physical function and your ability to do normal daily activities. 
ORENCIA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis alone or in combination with methotrexate. </p>
<p>Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a long-term inflammatory disease affecting one or more 
joints in children and adolescents. 
ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is used in children and adolescents aged 6 
to 17 years when a previous disease-modifying medicine has not worked well enough or is not suitable 
for them. ORENCIA is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although ORENCIA may also 
be used alone in case of intolerance to methotrexate or if treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. </p>
<p>ORENCIA is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow down the damage to joints </li>
<li>improve physical function </li>
<li>improve other signs and symptoms of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis </li>

* if you are allergic to abatacept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* if you have a severe or uncontrolled infection, do not start treatment with ORENCIA. Having 
an infection could put you at risk of serious side effects from ORENCIA. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse: 
* if you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or 
lightheadedness, swelling or skin rash tell your doctor immediately. 
* if you have any kind of infection, including long-term or localised infection, if you often get 
infections or if you have symptoms of infection (e.g. fever, malaise, dental problems), it is 
important to tell your doctor. ORENCIA can lower your body's ability to fight infection and 
the treatment can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection you have worse. 
* if you have had tuberculosis (TB) or have symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight 
loss, listlessness, mild fever) tell your doctor. Before you are given ORENCIA, your doctor 
will examine you for tuberculosis or do a skin test. 
* if you have viral hepatitis tell your doctor. Before you are given ORENCIA, your doctor may 
examine you for hepatitis. 
* if you have cancer, your doctor will decide if you can still be given ORENCIA. 
* if you recently had a vaccination or are planning to have one, tell your doctor. Some vaccines 
should not be given while you are receiving ORENCIA. Check with your doctor before you 
are given any vaccines. It is recommended that patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current 
immunisation guidelines prior to starting ORENCIA therapy. Certain vaccinations may cause 
infections from the vaccine. If you received ORENCIA while you were pregnant, your baby 
may be at a higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately 14 weeks after the 
last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and 
other health care professionals about your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy so they can 
decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. 
* if you are using a blood glucose monitor to check your blood glucose levels. ORENCIA 
contains maltose, which is a type of sugar that can give falsely high blood glucose readings with 
certain types of blood glucose monitors. Your doctor may recommend a different method for 
monitoring your blood glucose levels. </p>
<p>Your doctor may also do tests to examine your blood values. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion has not been studied in children and 
adolescents under 6 years of age, therefore ORENCIA powder for concentrate for infusion is not 
recommended for use in this patient population. </p>
<p>ORENCIA solution for injection pre-filled syringe is available for subcutaneous administration for 
paediatric patients 2 years of age and older. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ORENCIA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>ORENCIA should not be used with biological medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, including TNF-
blockers like adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab; there is not enough evidence to recommend its 
being given with anakinra and rituximab. </p>
<p>ORENCIA can be received with other medicines commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, such 
as steroids or painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen or diclofenac. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any other medicine while using ORENCIA. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The effects of ORENCIA in pregnancy are not known, so you should not be given ORENCIA if you 
are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. </p>
<ul>
<li>if you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception (birth 
control) while using ORENCIA and up to 14 weeks after the last dose. Your doctor will advise 
you on suitable methods. </li>
<li>if you become pregnant while using ORENCIA, tell your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you received ORENCIA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals about 
your ORENCIA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more 
information see section on vaccination). </p>
<p>It is not known whether ORENCIA passes into human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if you are 
being treated with ORENCIA and for up to 14 weeks after the last dose. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
The use of ORENCIA is not expected to affect the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. However, if 
you are feeling tired or unwell after receiving ORENCIA, you should not drive, cycle or operate any 
machinery. </p>
<p>ORENCIA contains sodium 
This medicine contains 34.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per maximum dose of 
4 vials (8.625 mg sodium per vial). This is equivalent to 1.7% of the recommended maximum daily 
dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>ORENCIA can be used by adults over 65 with no change in dose. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
For children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who 
weigh less than 75 kg, the recommended dose of intravenous abatacept is 10 mg/kg. Children 
weighing 75 kg or more should be administered ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion following the adult dosing regimen. </p>
<p>How ORENCIA is given to you 
ORENCIA is given to you into a vein, usually in your arm, over a period of 30 minutes. This 
procedure is referred to as an infusion. Healthcare professionals will monitor you while you receive 
your ORENCIA infusion. 
ORENCIA is supplied as a powder for solution for infusion. This means that before ORENCIA is 
given to you, it is first dissolved in water for injections, then further diluted with sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. </p>
<p>How often ORENCIA is given to you 
ORENCIA should be given to you again, 2 and then 4 weeks after the first infusion. After that you 
will receive a dose every 4 weeks. Your doctor will advise you on the duration of treatment and what 
other medicines you may continue to take while on ORENCIA. </p>
<p>If you are given more ORENCIA than you should 
If this happens, your doctor will monitor you for any signs or symptoms of side effects, and treat these 
symptoms if necessary. </p>
<p>If you forget to receive ORENCIA 
If you miss receiving ORENCIA when you are supposed to, ask your doctor when to schedule your 
next dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using ORENCIA 
The decision to stop using ORENCIA should be discussed with your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
