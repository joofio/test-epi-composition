treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have a specific change (called 
F508del mutation) affecting the gene for a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR), which plays an important role in regulating the flow of mucus in the lungs. People 
with the mutation will produce an abnormal CFTR protein. Cells contain two copies of the CFTR 
gene; Orkambi is used in patients in whom both copies are affected by the F508del mutation 
(homozygotes). </p>
<p>Lumacaftor and ivacaftor work together to improve the function of the abnormal CFTR protein. 
Lumacaftor increases the amount of CFTR available and ivacaftor helps the abnormal protein to work 
more normally.  </p>
<p>Orkambi may help your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also notice that it is 
easier to gain weight. </p>         </div>"""

Orkambi.  </p>
<p>Orkambi is not recommended in patients who have undergone an organ transplant. </p>

<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>

It is unknown if lumacaftor or ivacaftor are found in human milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your 
doctor for advice before taking Orkambi. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop

benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>

influence the ability to drive or use machines. If you experience dizziness, you should not drive or use 
machines until these symptoms disappear. </p>

bike or do anything else that needs their full attention, until their symptoms disappear. </p>

in the evening.  </li>
<li>Severe liver problems: the dose may be reduced to one tablet in the morning and one tablet in

missed the dose. Otherwise, wait until your next scheduled dose as you normally would. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. </p>
