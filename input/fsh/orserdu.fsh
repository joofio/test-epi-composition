<p>ORSERDU contains the active substance elacestrant which belongs to a group of medicines called

<p>What ORSERDU is used for </p>
<p>This medicine is used to treat postmenopausal women and adult men who have a specific type of 
breast cancer that is advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). It can be used to 
treat breast cancer that is estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, meaning that the cancer cells have receptors 
for the hormone oestrogen on their surface, and that is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative, meaning that cancer cells have no or only a small amount of this receptor on their 
surface. ORSERDU is used as monotherapy (used on its own) in patients whose cancer has not 
responded to or progressed further following at least one line of hormonal treatment including a 
CDK 4/6 inhibitor and who have certain changes (mutations) in a gene called ESR</p>         </div>"""

positive result is required for initiation of treatment with ORSERDU. </p>
<p>How ORSERDU works </p>
<p>Oestrogen receptors are a group of proteins found inside the cells. They are activated when the 
hormone oestrogen binds to them. By binding to these receptors, oestrogen can in some cases 
stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. ORSERDU contains the active substance elacestrant that 
binds to the oestrogen receptors in the cancer cells and stops them from working. By blocking and 
destroying oestrogen receptors, ORSERDU can reduce the growth and spread of breast cancer and 
help to kill cancer cells. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how ORSERDU works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

ORSERDU should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>

other medicines can affect the way ORSERDU works. </p>

<p>ORSERDU with food and drink 
Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit while on treatment with ORSERDU as it may change 
the amount of ORSERDU in your body and increase the side effects of ORSERDU (see Section 3 
 How to take ORSERDU . </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
This medicine should only be used in postmenopausal women and in men. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
ORSERDU may harm an unborn baby. You must not take ORSERDU if you are pregnant, think you 
may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. If you think you may be pregnant or planning to have 
a baby, ask your doctor, or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you should use effective contraception while you are 
being treated with ORSERDU and for one week after stopping treatment with ORSERDU. Ask your 
doctor for suitable methods. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will rule out 
an existing pregnancy before starting you on treatment with ORSERDU. This may include having a 
pregnancy test. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You must not breast-feed while on treatment with ORSERDU and for one week after the last dose of 
ORSERDU. During treatment, your doctor will discuss the potential risks of taking ORSERDU during 
pregnancy or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Fertility 
ORSERDU may impair fertility in women and men. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
ORSERDU has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, since 
fatigue, weakness, and difficulty sleeping have been reported in some patients taking elacestrant, 
caution should be observed by patients who experience those adverse reactions when driving or 
operating machinery. </p>         </div>"""
