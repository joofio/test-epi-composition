<p>Otezla contains the active substance  apremilast . This belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, which help to reduce inflammation. </p>
<p>What Otezla is used for </p>
<p>Otezla is used to treat adults with the following conditions: 
* Active psoriatic arthritis - if you cannot use another type of medicine called 
 Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs  (DMARDs) or when you have tried one of these 
medicines and it did not work.<br />
* Moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis - if you cannot use one of the following 
treatments or when you have tried one of these treatments and it did not work:</p>
<ul>
<li>phototherapy - a treatment where certain areas of skin are exposed to ultraviolet light </li>
<li>systemic therapy - a treatment that affects the entire body rather than just one local area, 
such as  ciclosporin ,  methotrexate  or  psoralen  . </li>
<li>Beh et s disease (BD) - to treat the mouth ulcers which is a common problem for people with 
this illness. </li>
</ul>
<p>What psoriatic arthritis is </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis, an 
inflammatory disease of the skin.  </p>
<p>What plaque psoriasis is </p>
<p>Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin, which can cause red, scaly, thick, itchy, painful 
patches on your skin and can also affect your scalp and nails.  </p>
<p>What Beh et s disease is </p>
<p>Beh et s disease is a rare type of inflammatory disease which affects many parts of the body. The 
most common problem is mouth ulcers. </p>
<p>How Otezla works </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and Beh et s disease are usually lifelong conditions and there is currently 
no cure. Otezla works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called  phosphodiesterase 4 , 
which is involved in the process of inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Otezla can 
help to control the inflammation associated with psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and Beh et s disease, and 
thereby reduce the signs and symptoms of these conditions. </p>
<p>In psoriatic arthritis, treatment with Otezla results in an improvement in swollen and painful joints, 
and can improve your general physical function. </p>
<p>In psoriasis, treatment with Otezla results in a reduction in psoriatic skin plaques and other signs and 
symptoms of the disease. </p>
<p>In Beh et s disease, treatment with Otezla reduces the number of mouth ulcers and can stop them 
completely. It can also reduce the associated pain. </p>
<p>Otezla has also been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis 
or Beh et s disease. This means that the impact of your condition on daily activities, relationships and 
other factors should be less than it was before.  </p>         </div>"""
