  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Ovitrelle is </p>
<p>Ovitrelle contains a medicine called  choriogonadotropin alfa , made in a laboratory by a special 
recombinant DNA technique. Choriogonadotropin alfa is similar to a hormone found naturally in your 
body called  chorionic gonadotropin , which is involved in reproduction and fertility. </p>
<p>What Ovitrelle is used for </p>
<p>Ovitrelle is used together with other medicines: 
* To help develop and ripen several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing 
assisted reproductive technologies (procedure that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
 in vitro fertilisation . Other medicines will be given first to bring about the growth of several 
follicles. 
* To help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation induction) in women who cannot produce eggs 
( anovulation ), or women who produce too few eggs ( oligo-ovulation ). Other medicines will 
be given first to develop and ripen the follicles. </p>
<ol>
<li>What do you need to know before you use Ovitrelle </li>
</ol>
<p>Do not use Ovitrelle </p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to choriogonadotropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </li>
<li>if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). </li>
<li>if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. </li>
<li>if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding. </li>
<li>if you have cancer of your ovaries, womb or breast. </li>
<li>if you have severe inflammation of your veins or blood clotting in your veins (active 
thromboembolic disorders). </li>
<li>if you have any condition that usually makes a normal pregnancy impossible, such as 
menopause or early menopause (ovarian failure), or malformations of sexual organs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use Ovitrelle if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Before the treatment is started, your and your partner's fertility should be evaluated by a doctor 
experienced in the treatment of fertility problems. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) </p>
<p>This medicine may increase your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too 
much and become large cysts. </p>
<p>If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting, or have difficulty 
in breathing, do not give yourself the Ovitrelle injection and talk to your doctor straight away (see 
section 4). If you are developing OHSS, you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier 
contraceptive method for at least four days. </p>
<p>The risk of OHSS is reduced if the usual dose of Ovitrelle is used, and if you are monitored closely 
throughout your treatment cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound). </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy and/or birth defects </p>
<p>When using Ovitrelle, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time ( multiple pregnancy , usually twins) than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technologies, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of 
couples with fertility problems (e.g. age) may also be associated with an increased chance of birth 
defects. </p>
<p>The risk of multiple pregnancy is reduced if you are monitored closely throughout your treatment 
cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound). </p>
<p>Ectopic pregnancy </p>
<p>Pregnancy outside of the womb (an ectopic pregnancy) may occur in women with damaged fallopian 
tubes (the tubes which carry the egg from the ovary to the womb). Therefore, your doctor should 
perform an early ultrasound examination to rule out the possibility of pregnancy outside the womb. </p>
<p>Miscarriage </p>
<p>When undergoing assisted reproductive technologies or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. </p>
<p>Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Ovitrelle if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots 
in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots 
or existing clots might become worse with Ovitrelle treatment. </p>
<p>Tumours of sexual organs </p>
<p>There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. </p>
<p>Pregnancy tests </p>
<p>If you do a pregnancy test with serum or urine after use of Ovitrelle, and up to ten days later, it may 
happen that you get a false positive test result. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Ovitrelle is not for use in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ovitrelle </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not use Ovitrelle if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>It is not expected that Ovitrelle will affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Ovitrelle contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Stop using Ovitrelle and see a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side 
effects   you may need urgent medical treatment: 
* Allergic reactions such as rash, fast or uneven pulse, swelling of your tongue and throat, 
sneezing, wheezing, or serious breathing difficulty are very rare (may affect up to 1 in 
10,000 people). 
* Lower abdominal pain, abdominal distension or abdominal discomfort together with nausea 
(feeling sick) or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts 
developed (see also in section 2. under  Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ). This event is 
common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
* The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This event is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
* Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see 
also in section 2. under  Blood clotting problems ). </p>
<p>Other side effects </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* Headache. 
* Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness or swelling. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* Diarrhoea. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
