<p>Oxbryta contains the active substance voxelotor. Voxelotor works on a protein in red blood cells 
called haemoglobin to help it take up oxygen that red blood cells can deliver throughout the body. </p>
<p>Patients with the condition called sickle cell disease have an altered form of haemoglobin called sickle 
haemoglobin which is different from the normal haemoglobin. When the sickle haemoglobin gives up 
oxygen to the tissues, it sticks together to form long rods and causes red blood cells to alter their shape 
to that of a crescent moon making these cells rigid and sickled shape. Sickle red blood cells cannot 
deliver oxygen as well as healthy red blood cells and are also broken down more quickly, leading to 
lowered levels of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia). By improving the way the altered 
haemoglobin holds onto oxygen, Oxbryta improves the function of red blood cells and prolongs their 
lifespan. </p>
<p>What Oxbryta is used for </p>
<p>Oxbryta, alone or together with hydroxycarbamide (also known as hydroxyurea), is used to treat 
haemolytic anaemia in adults and children from 12 years with sickle cell disease.  </p>         </div>"""
