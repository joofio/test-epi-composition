<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to cenegermin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Only use this medicine in your affected eye(s). 
Talk to your doctor before using this medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have an infection in your eye, as the infection should be treated first. If you get an eye 
infection whilst using OXERVATE, you should stop your treatment and consult your doctor for 
advice straightaway. </li>
<li>if you have an eye cancer, because this medicine might worsen your cancer.  </li>
<li>if you are taking any eye drops containing corticosteroids (e.g. to treat an ocular inflammation) 
or preservatives (e.g. benzalkonium chloride, polyquaternium-1, benzododecinium bromide, 
cetrimide). Eye drops containing these substances could slow down or interfere with the healing 
of your eye and should therefore be avoided during treatment with this medicine.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment with OXERVATE may cause you mild to moderate eye discomfort such as eye pain. If you 
experience a severe eye reaction seek medical advice from your doctor.<br />
Contact lenses could interfere with the correct use of this medicine. If you wear contact lenses remove 
them before using this medicine and wait 15 minutes after using this medicine before reinserting 
them. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, as there is not 
enough information about its use in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and OXERVATE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>You should wait at least 15 minutes before or after using OXERVATE if you use any other eye 
drops. This will help to avoid one eye drop diluting the other eye drop. If you also use an eye ointment 
or gel or an eye drop with a thick consistency, you should use OXERVATE first, and then wait at 
least 15 minutes before using the other medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>The use of this medicine should be avoided during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant 
or think you may be pregnant. </p>
<p>It is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. Talk to your doctor before breast-feeding your 
baby, as a decision must be made whether to stop breast-feeding or to avoid or stop OXERVATE 
therapy. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your vision may be temporarily blurred immediately after using this medicine. If this happens, wait 
until your vision clears before you drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 1 drop in the affected eye 6 times a day at 2-hourly intervals, starting in 
the morning (i.e. 6 drops per day within 12 hours). You should continue your treatment for 8 weeks. </p>
<p>Instructions for use 
Follow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not 
understand. 
Ocular use.<br />
You will receive an insulated container containing a weekly carton of OXERVATE and a separate 
delivery system (composed of medical devices intended for withdrawing and administering the 
medicine). </p>
<p>The weekly carton contains 7 vials of OXERVATE (1 vial per day of the week). Remove the weekly 
carton of OXERVATE from the insulated container and store it in a fridge as soon as you can (and in 
any case no later than 5 hours from when you receive the medicine from your pharmacist). Since at the 
pharmacy this medicine is stored in a freezer, in case treatment is started right away after receiving the 
weekly carton, you will have to wait until the first vial is thawed (this could take up to 30 minutes). </p>
<p>Take an individual vial of this medicine from the fridge in the morning (always at the same time each 
morning), and prepare it in the following way: 
* Wash your hands. 
* If you wear contact lenses, take them out before using the drops and wait 15 minutes after 
using this medicine before reinserting them. 
* Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the vial (picture 1). 
* Peel-off the back of the vial adapter blister pack (picture 2). 
* Without removing the vial adapter from its blister pack, connect it to the vial by firmly pushing 
it down until it snaps into place over the neck of the vial. The spike of the vial adapter should 
pierce through the vial s rubber stopper. Once the vial adapter has been connected correctly, it 
should not be removed from the vial (picture 3). 
* Remove and discard the packaging of the vial adapter. </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>The multi-dose vial of OXERVATE is now ready for use (1 drop in the affected eye every 2 hours six 
times a day). The vial can be stored in the fridge or below 25  C throughout the day, but should not be 
frozen. </p>
<p>To withdraw and administer each dose of this medicine, follow the steps below: 
* Take a single disinfectant wipe and gently clean the surface of the valve on the connector part of 
the vial adapter (picture 4). After cleaning, wait for approximately 1 minute to allow the valve 
to dry. 
* Take a pipette (dropper) and remove it from its protective packaging. 
* Screw the pipette (clockwise) into the connector part of the vial adapter (picture 5). 
* Ensure that the pipette plunger is pushed all the way down. 
* Turn the vial upside-down (with the pipette still connected) and gently pull the plunger until it 
stops, to draw the solution into the pipette. Ensure the plunger has reached the stop point 
(picture 6). </p>
<p>4 </p>
<p>5 </p>
<p>6 </p>
<ul>
<li>Check the pipette to ensure it contains the eye drops, solution. Air bubbles may cause blockage 
and prevent the pipette from filling properly (especially at first withdrawal). If the pipette is 
empty, keep the vial with the connected pipette upside-down, push the plunger all the way in 
and pull it out again. </li>
<li>Once it has been correctly filled, unscrew the pipette from the connector part of the vial adapter. </li>
<li>Holding the pipette, pointing down, between your middle finger and thumb, tilt your head back 
and position the pipette above your affected eye. Pull down your lower eyelid with a finger, 
which detaches from the eye and forms a cavity. Gently push the plunger in until a single drop 
is dropped into the conjunctival fornix (picture 7). Make sure you do not touch your eye with 
the tip of the pipette. </li>
<li>With your head still tilted back, close your eye a few times so that the medicine covers the 
surface of your eye and stay in your eye. </li>
<li>Immediately discard the used pipette after use, even if there is still some liquid left in it. </li>
<li>If a drop misses your eye, try again, using a new pipette and wipe. </li>
<li>After each use throughout the day, wash your hands, and place the vial back in the fridge (or 
keep it below 25  C) for the rest of the day, with the vial adapter still connected. </li>
</ul>
<p>7</p>
<p>Repeat the above process (from picture 4 onwards) every 2 hours 6 times a day. Use a new 
disinfectant wipe and a new pipette each time. </p>
<p>If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the above instructions for your other eye using a new pipette (in 
this case, you will need to use 2 vials per day). </p>
<p>Discard the used vial at the end of each day (even if there is still some liquid left in it), and in any case 
no later than 12 hours from the time you connected the vial adapter to it. </p>
<p>You will receive a new supply of OXERVATE each week, for the duration of the treatment period. 
To ensure accurate dosing every 2 hours, you could set an alarm as a reminder for dosing. </p>
<p>To control that six doses have been taken at the end of each treatment day, you should use the weekly 
dose recording card provided with the delivery system. On that card you should write down the date of 
the first use of the weekly supply, the time of the vial opening (i.e. when you connect the vial adapter 
to the vial) and track each time you use an eye drop of this medicine, over the week. </p>
<p>If you use more OXERVATE than you should 
If you use more than you should, flush the affected eye with lukewarm water. Do not put in any more 
drops until it is time for your next regular dose. Using more OXERVATE than is recommended is not 
likely to be harmful.  Continue with your next dose as scheduled. </p>
<p>If you forget to use OXERVATE 
Continue with your next dose as scheduled. Do not use a double dose to make up for the forgotten 
dose. You can give the missed dose 2 hours after your last scheduled dose of the day, provided this is 
still within 12 hours from first opening the daily vial. Do not use more than 6 drops each day in the 
affected eye(s). 
If you stop using OXERVATE<br />
The lesion or ulcer in your eye will worsen and could lead to infections or impaired vision. Speak to 
your doctor first if you intend to stop using OXERVATE. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
