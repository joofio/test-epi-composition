<p>Oxlumo contains the active substance lumasiran. </p>
<p>What Oxlumo is used for </p>
<p>Oxlumo is used to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) in adults and children of all ages. </p>
<p>What PH1 is </p>
<p>PH1 is a rare illness in which the liver produces too much of a substance called oxalate. Your kidneys 
remove oxalate from the body and it is passed out in the urine. In people with PH1, the extra oxalate 
can build up in the kidneys and cause kidney stones, and can stop the kidney from working as well as 
they should. A build-up of oxalate can also damage other parts of the body such as eyes, heart, skin, 
and bone. This is called oxalosis. </p>
<p>How Oxlumo works </p>
<p>Lumasiran, the active substance in Oxlumo, reduces the amount of an enzyme called glycolate oxidase 
that the liver makes. Glycolate oxidase is one of the enzymes involved in producing oxalate. By 
lowering the amount of the enzyme, the liver produces less oxalate and the levels of oxalate in the 
urine and blood also fall. This can help to reduce the effects of the illness. </p>         </div>"""
