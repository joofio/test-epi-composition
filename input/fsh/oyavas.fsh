  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Oyavas contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a type 
of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection and 
cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF protein 
causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with nutrients 
and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking the 
growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour.
Oyavas is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, 
i.e., in the colon or rectum. Oyavas will be administered in combination with chemotherapy treatment 
containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine.
Oyavas is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for 
patients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called 
paclitaxel or capecitabine.
Oyavas is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
Oyavas will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum.
Oyavas is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer when 
cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
Oyavas will be administered in combination with erlotinib.
Oyavas is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for 
patients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon.
Oyavas is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Oyavas will be administered in 
combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
When used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated 
with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Oyavas will be administered in 
combination with paclitaxel, topotecan or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.
Oyavas is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer. Oyavas will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, 
paclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Oyavas</p>
<p>Oyavas may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you have conditions causing 
inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, colitis associated with 
chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor.</p>
<p>Oyavas may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway between two 
organs or vessels. The risk of developing connections between the vagina and any parts of the
gut can increase if you have persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Oyavas can increase the risk of bleeding or increase the risk of problems with wound healing
after surgery. If you are going to have an operation, if you have had major surgery within the
last 28 days or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery, you should not receive
this medicine.</p>
<p>Oyavas may increase the risk of developing serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under 
the skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing.</p>
<p>Oyavas can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure 
which is not well controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your doctor as it is 
important to make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting Oyavas
treatment.</p>
<p>If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall.</p>
<p>Oyavas increases the risk of having protein in your urine especially if you already have high 
blood pressure.</p>
<p>The risk of developing blood clots in your arteries (a type of blood vessel) can increase if you 
are over 65 years old, if you have diabetes, or if you have had previous blood clots in your 
arteries. Please talk to your doctor since blood clots can lead to heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>Oyavas can also increase the risk of developing blood clots in your veins (a type of blood 
vessel).</p>
<p>Oyavas may cause bleeding, especially tumour-related bleeding. Please consult your doctor if
you or your family tend to suffer from bleeding problems or you are taking medicines to thin the
blood for any reason.</p>
<p>Oyavas may cause bleeding in and around your brain. Please discuss this with your doctor if you 
have metastatic cancer affecting your brain.</p>
<p>Oyavas can increase the risk of bleeding in your lungs, including coughing or spitting blood. 
Please discuss with your doctor if you noticed this previously.</p>
<p>Oyavas can increase the risk of developing a weak heart. It is important that your doctor knows if 
you have ever received anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin, a specific type of chemotherapy 
used to treat some cancers) or had radiotherapy to your chest, or if you have heart disease.</p>
<p>Oyavas may cause infections and a decreased number of your neutrophils (a type of blood cell 
important for your protection against bacteria).</p>
<p>Oyavas can cause hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic shock) and/or infusion reactions 
(reactions related to your injection of the medicine). Please let your doctor, pharmacist or nurse 
know if you have previously experienced problems after injections, such as dizziness/feeling of 
fainting, breathlessness, swelling or skin rash.</p>
<p>A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has 
been associated with Oyavas treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, confusion or 
seizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor.</p>
<p>Death of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw has been reported in patients 
under 18 years old when treated with Oyavas. Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or 
sores inside the mouth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth 
could be signs and symptoms of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and 
dentist immediately if you experience any of them.
Please consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past.
Before you are given Oyavas or while you are being treated with Oyavas:</p>
<p>if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, 
numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your doctor and dentist 
immediately.</p>
<p>if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are 
being treated with Oyavas, in particular when you are also receiving or have received an injection 
of bisphosphonate into your blood.
You may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with Oyavas.
Oyavas has been developed and made to treat cancer by injecting it into the bloodstream. It has not 
been developed or made for injection into the eye. It is therefore not authorised to be used in this way. 
When Oyavas is injected directly into the eye (unapproved use), the following side effects may occur:</p>
<p>Infection or inflammation of the eye globe,</p>
<p>Redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain,</p>
<p>Seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision,</p>
<p>Increased eye pressure,</p>
<p>Bleeding in the eye.
Children and adolescents
Oyavas use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the 
safety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations.
Other medicines and Oyavas
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Combinations of Oyavas with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and 
gastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you 
do not combine these medicines.
Tell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast 
cancer. These therapies in combination with Oyavas may increase the risk of severe side effects.
Please tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
You must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. Oyavas may cause damage to your unborn baby 
as it may stop the formation of new blood vessels. Your doctor should advise you about using 
contraception during treatment with Oyavas and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Oyavas.
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
You must not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Oyavas and for at least 6 months after the 
last dose of Oyavas, as this medicine may interfere with the growth and development of your baby.
Oyavas may impair female fertility. Please consult your doctor for more information.
Pre-menopausal women (women who have a menstrual cycle) may notice that their periods become 
irregular or are missed and may experience impaired fertility. If you are considering having children 
you should discuss this with your doctor before your treatment starts.
Driving and using machines
Oyavas has not been shown to reduce your ability to drive or to use any tools or machines. However, 
sleepiness and fainting have been reported with Oyavas use. If you experience symptoms that affect 
your vision or concentration, or your ability to react, do not drive and use machines until symptoms 
disappear.
Oyavas contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

The dose of Oyavas needed depends on your body weight and the kind of cancer to be treated. The 
recommended dose is 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg per kilogram of your body weight. Your doctor 
will prescribe a dose of Oyavas that is right for you. You will be treated with Oyavas once every 2 or 
3 weeks. The number of infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to 
treatment; you should continue to receive this medicine until Oyavas fails to stop your tumour 
growing. Your doctor will discuss this with you.
Method and route of administration
Do not shake the vial. Oyavas is a concentrate for solution for infusion. Depending on the dose
prescribed for you, some or all of the contents of the Oyavas vial will be diluted with sodium chloride
solution before use. A doctor or nurse will give you this diluted Oyavas solution by intravenous
infusion (a drip into your vein). The first infusion will be given to you over 90 minutes. If this is
well-tolerated the second infusion may be given over 60 minutes. Later infusions may be given to you 
over 30 minutes.
The administration of Oyavas should be temporarily discontinued</p>
<p>if you develop severe high blood pressure requiring treatment with blood pressure medicines,</p>
<p>if you have problems with wound healing following surgery,</p>
<p>if you undergo surgery.
The administration of Oyavas should be permanently discontinued if you develop</p>
<p>severe high blood pressure which cannot be controlled by blood pressure medicines; or a sudden 
severe rise in blood pressure,</p>
<p>presence of protein in your urine accompanied by swelling of your body,</p>
<p>a hole in your gut wall,</p>
<p>an abnormal tube-like connection or passage between the windpipe and the gullet, between 
internal organs and skin, between the vagina and any parts of the gut or between other tissues that 
are not normally connected (fistula), and are judged by your doctor to be severe,</p>
<p>serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under the skin,</p>
<p>a blood clot in your arteries,</p>
<p>a blood clot in the blood vessels of your lungs,</p>
<p>any severe bleeding.
If too much of Oyavas is given</p>
<p>you may develop a severe migraine. If this happens you should talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse immediately.
If a dose of Oyavas is missed</p>
<p>your doctor will decide when you should be given your next dose of Oyavas. You should discuss 
this with your doctor.
If you stop treatment with Oyavas
Stopping your treatment with Oyavas may stop the effect on tumour growth. Do not stop treatment 
with Oyavas unless you have discussed this with your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""
