<p>PALFORZIA is intended for children and young people aged from 4 to 17 years and those who 
become adults whilst on treatment. </p>
<p>PALFORZIA works in people with peanut allergy by gradually increasing the body’s ability to 
tolerate small amounts of peanut (desensitisation). PALFORZIA can help reduce the severity of 
allergic reactions after coming into contact with peanut. </p>
<p>PALFORZIA is not effective against any other nut or food allergies. </p>

- if you are allergic to any of the excipients (other ingredients) in this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have severe asthma or if your asthma is not under control (as assessed by a doctor). </li>
<li>if you have ever had a problem swallowing or long term problems with your digestive system. </li>
<li>if you have ever had a severe mast cell disorder (as assessed by a doctor). </li>
<li>if you had severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis within 60 days before starting treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking PALFORZIA and tell your doctor about any medical conditions that 
you have. </p>
<p>You must not take any peanut or peanut containing food in your diet whilst taking PALFORZIA. </p>
<p>It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your PALFORZIA. So, every time you get a 
new package of PALFORZIA, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging 
after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. </p>
<p>PALFORZIA does not treat the symptoms of peanut allergy and you must not take 
PALFORZIA during an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Your doctor will advise the best time to start treatment depending on any medical conditions that you 
have.  </p>
<p>PALFORZIA contains the substance that patients with peanut allergy react to. Allergic reactions to 
PALFORZIA may occur during treatment. These reactions mostly occur during the first two hours 
after taking a PALFORZIA dose and are usually mild or moderate but ocasionally can be severe. </p>
<p>Stop taking PALFORZIA and get medical treatment straight away if you have any of the following 
symptoms: 
- Trouble breathing 
- Throat tightness or feeling of fulness in throat<br />
- Trouble swallowing 
- Change in voice<br />
- Dizziness or fainting or feeling of impending doom 
- Severe stomach cramps or pain, vomiting or diarrhoea 
- Severe flushing or itching of the skin 
- Worsening of asthma or of any other breathing condition 
- Heartburn, difficult swallowing, pain with swallowing, stomach pain or chest pain that does 
not go away or worsens </p>
<p>Certain conditions or factors can increase the likelihood of an allergic reaction. These include: 
- Worsening of asthma 
- Having an open sore or other damage to the lining of the mouth or the passage leading from the 
mouth to the stomach (oesophagus) 
- Exercising 
- Having a hot bath or shower 
- Being very tired or missing sleep 
- For women, having your period<br />
- Taking certain pain medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen 
- Drinking alcohol 
- Being stressed 
- Taking PALFORZIA on an empty stomach 
- Having an illness such as a cold or flu or other viral infections </p>
<p>There are actions you should take to avoid some of these factors from affecting you. These factors 
include: exercise, having a hot bath or shower, drinking alcohol, or taking this medicine on an empty 
stomach. See the sections on ‘PALFORZIA with food, drink and alcohol’ and ‘Dosing instructions’ 
for advice on what to do about these. </p>
<p>For all other conditions or factors listed above, contact your doctor for advice if you experience 
allergic reactions during any of these. </p>
<p>Your doctor will prescribe adrenaline for you to self-inject, which you must have with you at all times 
in case you have a severe allergic reaction. Your doctor will tell you how to recognise an allergic 
reaction and teach you when and how to use the adrenaline. Talk to your doctor and read the 
adrenaline package leaflet if you have any questions about its use. </p>
<p>If you use adrenaline, do not take any further doses of PALFORZIA and seek emergency medical care 
immediately afterwards. </p>
<p>Desensitisation to peanut with PALFORZIA takes time. The ability to tolerate gradually increasing 
small amounts of peanut has been shown after completion of all up-dosing levels of PALFORZIA and 
after at least 3 months of maintenance therapy and this continues to improve over time. </p>
<p>You must take PALFORZIA every day to maintain the desensitisation it provides. Missing any doses 
can lead to an increased risk of allergic reactions. </p>
<p>PALFORZIA treatment may not work in all patients. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>PALFORZIA is intended for children and young people aged 4 to 17 years and those who become 
adults whilst on treatment. </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children aged less than 4 years because it is not known if PALFORZIA is 
safe and effective in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and PALFORZIA </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>PALFORZIA with food, drink and alcohol </p>
<p>PALFORZIA should not be mixed with liquid (e.g., water, milk, juice, soup, smoothie). </p>
<p>Do not drink alcohol 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking PALFORZIA as this may increase the 
likelihood of an allergic reaction.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Do not start treatment with PALFORZIA if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>PALFORZIA may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or operate machinery. Exercise 
caution for 2 hours after taking a dose of PALFORZIA in case you have an allergic reaction which 
affects your ability to drive, cycle, or use machinery. Wait until all symptoms of such allergic 
reactions have gone away before driving, cycling, or using machinery. </p>         </div>"""

sure. </p>
<p>PALFORZIA is prescribed by doctors who are experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of allergy 
and allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. </p>
<p>How should I take PALFORZIA? </p>
<p>Dosing </p>
<p>There are 3 phases of treatment with PALFORZIA: initial dose escalation, up-dosing, and 
maintenance. You must complete these treatment phases in the order that your doctor has prescribed. 
During the initial dose escalation and up-dosing phases, the dose of PALFORZIA is increased in a 
precise way. During the maintenance phase, you take the same dose of PALFORZIA each day. </p>
<p>You should take PALFORZIA every day to maintain your level of desensitisation to peanuts. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor on the day of each clinic visit if you are feeling unwell or if you feel your asthma is 
less controlled. </p>
<p>Initial dose escalation </p>
<p>You will be treated with the first doses (initial dose escalation) of PALFORZIA over about 4 to 
5 hours in your doctor’s clinic. On the first day you will be treated with 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg, 
and 6 mg of PALFORZIA. </p>
<p>Up-dosing </p>
<p>If you tolerate the initial dose-escalation phase, you will be asked to return to your doctor’s clinic on 
another day (usually the next day) to start the up-dosing phase. </p>
<p>There are 11 different dose levels of up-dosing, starting with PALFORZIA 3 mg (level 1) and 
increasing to PALFORZIA 300 mg (level 11). </p>
<p>The up-dosing levels are shown in the table below: </p>
<p>Daily dose

level 1 × 300mg sachet </p>
<p>The first dose of each up-dosing level is given to you by your doctor in a clinic. If you tolerate the first 
dose of a new dose level, your doctor will ask you to continue to take that dose every day at home for 
about 2 weeks. </p>
<p>During the up-dosing phase, your doctor will see you about every 2 weeks to assess you for a new up-
dosing level. </p>
<p>You must have completed all 11 up-dosing levels before you can start maintenance treatment. It will 
take at least 22 weeks to complete all up-dosing levels. </p>
<p>Maintenance dosing </p>
<p>If you are able tolerate level 11 of the up-dosing phase, your doctor will ask you to continue taking 
PALFORZIA at a 300 mg dose every day as maintenance therapy. </p>
<p>Preparation for use </p>
<p>PALFORZIA is available either in capsules or sachets. Empty the powder from PALFORZIA capsules 
or sachets.  </p>
<p>Do not swallow PALFORZIA capsules. </p>
<p>Open the daily dose of PALFORZIA. 
- To open a capsule gently pull the two ends of the capsule apart over a bowl with soft food and 
empty the powder into the bowl by rolling each half of the capsule between the finger and 
thumb. Tap the ends of each half capsule to make sure that all the powder is emptied. 
- To open a sachet carefully cut or tear along the top along the line indicated. Tip the sachet 
upside down over a bowl with soft food and tap the sachet to make sure that all the powder is 
emptied. </p>
<p>Empty the full dose of PALFORZIA oral powder on to a small amount of soft food to which you are 
not allergic such as fruit puree, yogurt, or rice-pudding. Make sure you are not allergic to the food 
used for mixing. </p>
<p>The food used for mixing should be cool and no warmer than room temperature. </p>
<p>Mix well. </p>
<p>Use just enough food to mix with PALFORZIA so you can eat it all in a few spoonfuls to take the full 
dose. </p>
<p>Take PALFORZIA immediately after mixing. However, if needed, you can mix PALFORZIA with 
food and keep it in a refrigerator for up to 8 hours before taking. If it is not used within 8 hours, throw 
it away and prepare a new dose. </p>
<p>Handling instructions </p>
<p>Do not breathe in PALFORZIA powder as this could cause breathing problems (worsening of asthma) 
or cause an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Wash your hands immediately after handling PALFORZIA capsules or sachets. </p>
<p>When your doctor has told you that an up-dosing level is complete, you must dispose of all remaining 
capsules or sachets from that pack (see section 5) before starting on a new level. This includes any 
extra doses that are provided in each pack, if not used. </p>
<p>Dosing instructions </p>
<p>Take PALFORZIA at about the same time every day with food, preferably as part of your evening 
meal. Do not take this medicine on an empty stomach. </p>
<p>Do not take PALFORZIA at home on the days that you visit your doctor for assessment as your doctor 
will give you PALFORZIA on these days. </p>
<p>Children should be given each dose of PALFORZIA by an adult and they should be watched for about 
1 hour afterwards for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Do not take within 2 hours of bedtime. </p>
<p>Do not have a hot bath or shower just before or for 3 hours after taking PALFORZIA. </p>
<p>Do not exercise just before or for 3 hours after taking PALFORZIA. </p>
<p>If you have been exercising or have taken a hot bath or shower and are feeling hot, or you are sweating 
and your heart is beating fast, do not take PALFORZIA until you have cooled down and your heart 
rate (pulse) has returned to normal. </p>
<p>Do not take more than your individual total daily dose according to your current dose level of 
PALFORZIA in a single day. </p>
<p>If you take more PALFORZIA than you should </p>
<p>Taking PALFORZIA at doses more than those recommended increases the risk of allergic reactions. </p>
<p>In the case of severe reactions such as difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, changes in your 
voice, or a feeling of fullness in the throat, treat the reaction with adrenaline self-injector as instructed 
by your doctor and then contact a doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take PALFORZIA </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>Missed doses of PALFORZIA may cause you to lose the peanut tolerance you have built up and 
increase your risk of allergic reactions. </p>
<p>If you miss your dose of PALFORZIA for 1 to 2 days in a row, take the next dose at your normal 
scheduled time the next day. </p>
<p>If you miss your dose of PALFORZIA for 3 days in a row or longer, stop taking PALFORZIA and 
contact your doctor for advice on how to start your treatment again. </p>
<p>If you stop taking PALFORZIA </p>
<p>Stopping PALFORZIA may cause you to lose the peanut tolerance you have built up and increase 
your risk of allergic reactions. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
