phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that causes phenylalanine from proteins in food to 
build up in the body. People who have PKU have high levels of phenylalanine and this can lead to 
serious health problems. Palynziq reduces the levels of phenylalanine in the blood of patients who 
have PKU whose blood phenylalanine levels cannot be kept below 600 micromol/l by other means 
such as by diet.  </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you have a severe allergy to pegvaliase or any other ingredients of this medicine, or another 
medicine that contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) (listed in section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Palynziq. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions<br />
You may have allergic reactions when being treated with Palynziq. Your doctor will tell you how to 
manage your allergic reactions based on the severity of the reaction, and will prescribe you additional 
medicines to manage the reaction. </p>
<p>Before using Palynziq, tell your doctor if you cannot use or do not want to use an adrenaline injection 
device to treat a severe allergic reaction to Palynziq. </p>
<p>Palynziq can cause severe allergic reactions that may be life-threatening and these can happen any 
time after a Palynziq injection.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stop injecting Palynziq if any of the following symptoms occur.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swelling of the face, eyes, lips, mouth, throat, tongue, hands and/or feet </p>
</li>
<li>Trouble breathing or wheezing </li>
<li>Throat tightness or choking feeling </li>
<li>Trouble swallowing or speaking </li>
<li>Feeling dizzy or fainting </li>
<li>Losing control of urine or stools </li>
<li>Rapid heartbeat </li>
<li>Hives (like an itchy, bumpy skin rash) that spreads quickly  </li>
<li>Flushing </li>
<li>
<p>Severe stomach cramps or pain, vomiting, or diarrhoea </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use adrenaline injection device as instructed by your doctor and seek urgent medical 
assistance.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will prescribe an adrenaline injection device to use for a severe allergic reaction. Your 
doctor will train you and someone helping you on when and how to use adrenaline. Keep the 
adrenaline injection device with you at all times.  </p>
<p>For at least the first 6 months of treatment, someone must be with you when you are self-injecting 
Palynziq. This person must stay with you for at least 1 hour after your injection to watch you for signs 
and symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and, if needed, give you an injection of adrenaline and call 
for emergency medical help. </p>
<p>If you have a severe allergic reaction, do not continue to use Palynziq until you have talked with the 
doctor who prescribes you Palynziq. Tell your doctor that you had a severe allergic reaction. Your 
doctor will tell you if you can continue Palynziq treatment. </p>
<p>Time needed to lower your blood phenylalanine levels 
Your doctor will start you on Palynziq at a low dose and will increase your dose slowly. It will take 
time to find the dose that works best to lower your blood phenylalanine levels. Most people respond 
within 18 months, but it can sometimes take up to 30 months. </p>
<p>Injection of other medicines that contain PEG while using Palynziq<br />
Palynziq includes an ingredient called polyethylene glycol (PEG). If you inject Palynziq with another 
injectable medicine that contains PEG, such as PEGylated medroxyprogesterone acetate, you may 
have an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are injecting, have recently injected or 
might inject any other medicines. </p>
<p>Blood phenylalanine levels that are too low 
You may have blood phenylalanine levels that are too low when using Palynziq. Your doctor will 
check your blood phenylalanine levels monthly. If your blood phenylalanine levels are too low, your 
doctor may ask you to change your diet and/or will lower your dose of Palynziq. Your doctor will 
check your blood phenylalanine levels every 2 weeks until your blood phenylalanine levels return to 
normal. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
It is not known if Palynziq is safe and effective in children and adolescents less than 16 years of age 
with PKU and therefore should not be used in people aged less than 16 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Palynziq 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Palynziq is not recommended during pregnancy unless your condition requires treatment with 
Palynziq and other ways of controlling your blood phenylalanine levels do not work. If your 
phenylalanine levels are too high or too low during pregnancy, this may harm you or your baby. You 
and your doctor will decide the best way for you to manage your blood phenylalanine levels. It is very 
important to keep your phenylalanine levels under control before and during pregnancy. </p>
<p>It is not known if Palynziq passes into breast milk or if it will affect your baby. Talk to your healthcare 
provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use Palynziq. </p>
<p>It is not known if Palynziq has an effect on fertility. Animal studies suggest that women may have 
difficulty becoming pregnant if their phenylalanine levels are abnormally low. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Palynziq can affect your ability to drive and use machines if you have a severe allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Palynziq contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dose </p>
<ul>
<li>You will start Palynziq at the lowest dose. You will use the 2.5 mg syringe once a week for at 
least the first 4 weeks. The 2.5 mg syringe has a white plunger.  </li>
<li>Your doctor will then slowly increase your dose and/or how often you inject Palynziq. Your 
doctor will tell you how long to stay at each dose. Slowly increasing your dose over time allows 
your body to adjust to this medicine.  </li>
<li>The goal is to reach a daily dose that lowers your blood phenylalanine levels to within the target 
range of 120 to 600 micromol/l and does not cause too many side effects. Patients usually need 
a daily dose of 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg to reach their target blood phenylalanine level. </li>

<p>Starting Palynziq </p>
<ul>
<li>Your healthcare provider will give you the Palynziq injection until you (or a caregiver) can do it 
yourself.  </li>
<li>Your doctor will prescribe medicines for you to take before your Palynziq injection, such as 
paracetamol, fexofenadine, and/or ranitidine. These medicines help to reduce the symptoms of 
an allergic reaction. </li>
<li>A healthcare provider will monitor you for at least 1 hour after you get Palynziq for signs and 
symptoms of an allergic reaction. </li>
<li>Your doctor will also prescribe adrenaline injection device to use for any severe allergic 
reactions. Your healthcare provider will also tell you which signs and symptoms to look out for

<ul>
<li>This medicine comes in pre-filled syringes with 3 different strengths (2.5 mg-white plunger, 
10 mg-green plunger, or 20 mg-blue plunger). You may need more than one pre-filled syringe 
for your prescribed dose. Your healthcare provider will tell you which syringe, or a combination 
of syringes, to use and will show you (or a caregiver) how to inject Palynziq.  </li>
<li>The  Instructions for Use  (section 7 of this leaflet) shows you: * 
how to prepare and inject Palynziq and * 
how to throw away Palynziq syringes properly after you use them </li>
<li>Your doctor will tell you how long to continue taking medicines such as paracetamol, 
fexofenadine, and/or ranitidine before you take Palynziq. </li>
<li>For at least the first 6 months of Palynziq treatment, you must have someone with you when 
you self-inject Palynziq, and for at least 1 hour after your injection to watch for signs and 
symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and, if needed, give you an injection of adrenaline and 
call for emergency medical help.  </li>

how to give an injection of adrenaline. * 
Your doctor will tell you if you need an observer for longer than 6 months.  </li>

</ul>
<p>If you use more Palynziq than you should 
If you use more Palynziq than you should, tell your doctor. See section 4 for details on what to do 
based on your symptoms.  </p>
