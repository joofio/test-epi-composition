declared pandemic. It is used in children and adolescents 12 months to less than 18 years of age.
Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many 
decades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary 
flu but may be more serious.
How Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca works
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is similar to Fluenz Tetra (a nasal influenza vaccine 
containing four strains), except Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca provides protection 
against a single influenza strain in an officially declared pandemic.
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause 
the flu.
Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca vaccine virus is grown in chicken eggs. The influenza 
strain used for the vaccine in an offically declared pandemic is recommended by the World Health 
Organisation.</p>         </div>"""

You should not be given Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca:</p>
<p>if you have previously had a serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to eggs, egg 
proteins, gentamicin, or gelatin or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in 
section 6  Contents of the pack and other information ). For signs of allergic reactions, see 
section 4  Possible side effects .  However, in a pandemic situation, your doctor may 
recommend to give you the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately 
available in case of an allergic reaction.
If any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination:</p>
<p>if the child is less than 12 months of age. Children less than 12 months of age should not 
receive this vaccine because of the risk of side effects.</p>
<p>if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction
to eggs, egg proteins, gentamicin, or gelatin or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed
in section 6  Contents of the pack and other information ).</p>
<p>if you are already taking acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used 
to relieve pain and lower fever). This is because of the risk of a very rare but serious disease
(Reye s syndrome).</p>
<p>if you have a blood disorder or a cancer that affects the immune system.</p>
<p>if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result 
of a disease, medicine, or other treatment.</p>
<p>if you have severe asthma or are currently wheezing.</p>
<p>if you are in close contact with someone with a severely weakened immune system
(for example, a bone marrow transplant patient needing isolation).
If any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will 
decide if Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is suitable for you.
Other medicines, other vaccines and Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the person being vaccinated is taking, has recently taken or 
might take any other medicines, including medicines that do not require a prescription.</p>
<p>Do not give acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain 
and lower fever) to children for 4 weeks after vaccination with Pandemic influenza vaccine 
H5N1 AstraZeneca unless your doctor, nurse or pharmacist tells you otherwise. This is because 
of the risk of Reye s syndrome, a very rare but serious disease that can affect the brain and liver.</p>
<p>It is recommended that Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is not given at the 
same time as influenza-specific antiviral medicines such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. This is 
because the vaccine may work less effectively.
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will decide if Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca can be 
given at the same time as other vaccines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or plan to become pregnant soon, tell your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will decide if Pandemic influenza 
vaccine H5N1 AstraZeneca is suitable for you.</p>

women.
