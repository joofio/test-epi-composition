PTH. </p>
<p>Parsabiv is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who 
need haemodialysis to clear their blood of waste products. </p>
<p>In secondary hyperparathyroidism too much PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands (four small 
glands in the neck). “Secondary” means that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, 
e.g. kidney disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause the loss of calcium from the bones, 
which can lead to bone pain and fractures and problems with blood and heart vessels. By controlling 
the levels of PTH, Parsabiv helps to control calcium and phosphate in your body. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Parsabiv<br />
- if you are allergic to etelcalcetide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have very low levels of calcium in your blood. Your doctor will monitor your blood 
calcium levels. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before you are given Parsabiv, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had: 
 
heart problems, such as heart failure or arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm); 
 
seizures (fits or convulsions). </p>
<p>Parsabiv reduces calcium levels. Please tell your doctor if you have spasms, twitches, or cramps in 
your muscles, or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth or seizures, 
confusion or loss of consciousness while being treated with Parsabiv. For additional information see 
section 4.<br />
Low calcium levels can cause abnormal heart rhythm. Tell your doctor if you experience an unusually 
fast or pounding heartbeat, if you have heart rhythm problems or heart failure or if you take medicines 
that can cause heart rhythm problems, while receiving Parsabiv. For additional information see 
section 4.<br />
Very low levels of PTH over long periods can result in a type of abnormal bone structure known as 
adynamic bone which can only be diagnosed by biopsy. Your PTH levels will be monitored during 
treatment with Parsabiv and your dose of Parsabiv may be reduced if your PTH levels become very 
low. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
It is not known whether Parsabiv is safe and effective in children less than 18 years of age as it has not 
been studied in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Parsabiv 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
those medicines obtained without a prescription, or any other medicines that lower serum calcium (e.g. 
cinacalcet and denosumab). </p>
<p>You should not receive Parsabiv together with cinacalcet. Tell your doctor if you are taking cinacalcet 
or have recently taken cinacalcet. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
Parsabiv has not been tested in pregnant women. It is not known whether Parsabiv can harm your 
unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant 
when taking Parsabiv. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Parsabiv during 
pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether Parsabiv can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding 
or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to 
stop taking Parsabiv, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Parsabiv 
to the mother. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Parsabiv has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However certain 
symptoms of low calcium levels (such as fits or convulsions) can affect your ability to drive or operate 
machinery. </p>
<p>Parsabiv contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""

machine. Parsabiv will be given 3 times per week. The dose may be increased up to 15 mg or lowered 
down to 2.5 mg depending on your response. </p>
