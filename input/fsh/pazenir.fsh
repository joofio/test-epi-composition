  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Pazenir is 
Pazenir contains, as its active substance, paclitaxel attached to the human protein albumin, in the form 
of tiny particles known as nanoparticles. Paclitaxel belongs to a group of medicines called  taxanes<br />
used in cancer. 
* Paclitaxel is the part of the medicine that affects the cancer, it works by stopping cancer cells 
from dividing   this means that they die. 
* Albumin is the part of the medicine that helps paclitaxel dissolve in the blood and get across the 
walls of the blood vessels into the tumour. This means that other chemicals that can cause side 
effects that can be life threatening are not needed. Such side effects occur far less with Pazenir. </p>
<p>What Pazenir is used for 
Pazenir is used to treat the following types of cancer: </p>
<p>Breast cancer 
* Breast cancer which has spread to other parts of the body (this is called  metastatic  breast 
cancer). 
* Pazenir is used in metastatic breast cancer when at least one other therapy has been tried but has 
not worked and you are unsuitable for treatments containing a group of medicines called 
 anthracyclines . 
* People with metastatic breast cancer who received paclitaxel attached to the human protein 
albumin where another therapy had failed, were more likely to experience a reduction in tumour 
size, and lived longer than people who took an alternative therapy. </p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer 
* Pazenir is used together with a medicine called gemcitabine if you have metastatic cancer of the 
pancreas. People with metastatic pancreatic cancer (pancreatic cancer that has spread to other 
parts of the body) who received paclitaxel attached to the human protein albumin with 
gemcitabine in a clinical trial lived longer than people who had only received gemcitabine. </p>
<p>Lung cancer 
* Pazenir is also used together with a medicine called carboplatin if you have the most common 
type of lung cancer, called  non-small cell lung cancer . 
* Pazenir is used in non-small cell lung cancer where surgery or radiotherapy would not be 
suitable to treat the disease. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients of Pazenir (listed 
in section 6); 
* if you are breast-feeding; 
* if you have a low white blood cell count (baseline neutrophil counts &lt;1500 cells/mm3 - your 
doctor will advise you on this). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Pazenir 
* if you have poor kidney function; 
* if you have severe liver problems; 
* if you have heart problems. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you experience any of these conditions whilst being treated with 
Pazenir, your doctor may wish to stop treatment or reduce the dose:

a fever; 
* if you experience numbness, tingling, pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle 
weakness; 
* if you experience breathing problems, like shortness of breath or dry cough. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is only for adults and should not be taken by children and adolescents aged below years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pazenir<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes medicines 
obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This is because Pazenir can affect the way 
some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way Pazenir works. </p>
<p>Take care and speak to your doctor when taking Pazenir at the same time as any of the following: 
* medicines for treating infections (i.e. antibiotics such as erythromycin, rifampicin, etc.; ask your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are unsure whether the medicine you are taking is an 
antibiotic), and including medicines for treating fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole) 
* medicines used to help you stabilize your mood also sometimes referred to as anti-depressants 
(e.g. fluoxetine) 
* medicines used to treat seizures (epilepsy) (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin) 
* medicines used to help you lower blood lipid levels (e.g. gemfibrozil) 
* medicine used for heartburn or stomach ulcers (e.g. cimetidine) 
* medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, 
efavirenz, nevirapine) 
* a medicine called clopidogrel used to prevent blood clots </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Paclitaxel may cause serious birth defects and should therefore not be used if you are pregnant. Your 
doctor will arrange a pregnancy test before starting treatment with Pazenir. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after 
receiving treatment with Pazenir. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed when taking Pazenir as it is not known if the active ingredient paclitaxel passes into 
the mother s milk. </p>
<p>Male patients are advised to use effective contraception and to avoid fathering a child during and up to 
six months after treatment and should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because 
of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Pazenir. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some people may feel tired or dizzy after being given Pazenir. If this happens to you, do not drive or 
use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>If you are given other medicines as part of your treatment, you should ask your doctor for advice on 
driving and using machines. </p>
<p>Pazenir contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
