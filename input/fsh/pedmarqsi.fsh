<p>Other medicines and Pedmarqsi 
Tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other

<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
This medicine should not be given if you or your child is pregnant (or could be pregnant), or is breast-

<p>This medicine is a solution that is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein by a doctor or nurse. This is 
usually done via a tube inserted into a vein in the chest, known as a central line. The infusion is given 
over 15 minutes. Treatment is started 6 hours after the dose of cisplatin has finished. </p>
<p>The dose of this medicine is worked out based on your size (body surface area) in m2, which is 
calculated from height and weight. The recommended dose for those weighing 10 kg or more is 12.8 g

vomiting, changes to levels of sodium, phosphate or potassium in the blood, changes to blood pressure,
