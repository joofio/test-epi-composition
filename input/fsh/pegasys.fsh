Interferon is a protein that modifies the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections 
and severe diseases. Pegasys is used to treat chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C in adults. It is 
also used to treat chronic hepatitis B in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older and chronic 
hepatitis C in children and adolescents aged 5 years and older, who have not been treated before. Both 
chronic hepatitis B and C are viral infections of the liver. </p>

<p>if you are being treated with telbivudine, a medicine for hepatitis B infection (see  Other 
medicines and Pegasys ). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse before using Pegasys </p>
<p>if you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder. </p>
<p>if you have ever had depression or symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of 
sadness, dejection, etc.). </p>
<p>if you are an adult who has or had a history of substance abuse (e.g. alcohol or drugs). </p>
<p>if you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with Pegasys. </p>
<p>if you have a problem with your liver other than hepatitis B or C. </p>
<p>if you have diabetes or high blood pressure, your doctor may ask you to have an eye 
examination. </p>
<p>if you have been told you have VKH syndrome.  </p>
<p>if you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines. </p>
<p>if you have ever had anaemia. </p>
<p>if you have had an organ transplant (liver or kidney) or have one planned in the near future. </p>
<p>if you are coinfected with HIV and treated with anti HIV medicinal products. </p>
<p>if you have been withdrawn from previous therapy for Hepatitis C because of anaemia or low 
blood count. </p>
<p>Once you have started Pegasys treatment, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist: </p>
<p>if you develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of sadness, dejection, etc.) 
(see section 4). </p>
<p>if you notice a change in your vision. </p>
<p>if you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection (such as cough, 
fever or any difficulty in breathing). </p>
<p>if you think you are getting an infection (such as pneumonia) as when receiving Pegasys you 
may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. </p>
<p>if you develop any signs of bleeding or unusual bruising, check with your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>if you develop signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing or 
hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately. </p>
<p>if you develop symptoms of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome; combination of complaints of 
neck stiffness, headache, loss of colour in skin or hair, eye disorders (such as blurred vision), 
and/or hearing abnormality (such as ringing in the ears). </p>
<p>During treatment your doctor will take blood samples regularly to check for changes in your white 
blood cells (cells that fight infection), red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen), platelets (blood clotting 
cells), liver function, glucose (blood sugar levels) or changes in other laboratory values. </p>
<p>Dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving 
Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on 
teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of Pegasys with 
ribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In 
addition, some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your 
mouth thoroughly afterwards. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Pegasys use is restricted to children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C aged 5 years and above 
or children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B aged 3 years and above. Pegasys must not be 
given to children below the age of 3 years because it contains benzyl alcohol and may cause toxic 
reactions and allergic reactions in these children.<br />
* If your child has or has ever had a psychiatric disorder, talk to your doctor, who will 
monitor your child for signs or symptoms of depression (see section 4). 
* When receiving Pegasys, your child may have slower growth and development (see 
section 4). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pegasys 
Do not use Pegasys if you are taking telbivudine (see  Do not use Pegasys ) because the combination 
of these medicines increases the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, and/or 
burning sensations in the arms and/or legs). Therefore, the combination of Pegasys with telbivudine is 
contraindicated. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are being treated with telbivudine. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for asthma, because the dose for your asthma medicine 
may need to be changed. </p>
<p>Patients who also have HIV infection: Tell your doctor if you are taking anti-HIV therapy. Lactic 
acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral 
Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the addition of Pegasys + 
ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis or liver failure. Your doctor will monitor you for 
signs and symptoms of these conditions. Patients receiving zidovudine in combination with ribavirin 
and alfa interferons are at increased risk of developing anaemia. Patients receiving azathioprin in 
combination with ribavirin and peginterferon are at increased risk of developing severe blood 
disorders. Please be sure to read the ribavirin package leaflet also. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
When Pegasys is used in combination with ribavirin, both male and female patients must take special 
precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur, as ribavirin can be 
very damaging to an unborn baby: 
* if you are a woman of childbearing potential who is taking Pegasys in combination with 
ribavirin, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during therapy 
and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during 
the time you are taking the treatment and for 4 months after stopping treatment. This can be 
discussed with your doctor. 
* if you are a man who is taking Pegasys in combination with ribavirin, do not have sex with a 
pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in 
the woman s body. If your female partner is not pregnant now, but is of childbearing potential, 
she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after 
treatment has stopped. You or your partner must use an effective contraceptive during the time 
you are taking the treatment and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed 
with your doctor. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. It is not known whether this 
product is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking Pegasys. In 
combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin 
containing medicinal products. </p>
<p>Refer also to the package leaflets of any other medicines that are used in combination with Pegasys. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you feel drowsy, tired, or confused while taking Pegasys.  </p>
<p>Benzyl alcohol<br />
Pegasys contains 10 mg benzyl alcohol in each vial which is equivalent to 10 mg/ml.  </p>
<p>Benzyl alcohol may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions. </p>
<p>Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems 
(called  gasping syndrome ) in young children. Pegasys must not be given to premature babies, 
neonates or children up to 3 years old.<br />
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast feeding, or if you have a liver 
or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may 
cause side effects (called  metabolic acidosis ). </p>
<p>Sodium 
Pegasys contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Pegasys is used alone only if you cannot take ribavirin for any reason. </p>
<p>Pegasys given alone or in combination with ribavirin is usually given at a dose of 
180 micrograms once a week. 
The duration of combination treatment varies from 4 to 18 months depending on the type of 
virus you are infected with, on treatment response and whether you have been treated before. 
Please check with your doctor and follow the recommended duration of treatment. 
Pegasys injection is normally taken at bedtime. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
Your doctor has determined the exact dose of Pegasys for your child and will tell you how often to use 
it. The usual dose of Pegasysis based on your child s height and weight. If necessary, the dose may be 
changed during treatment. It is recommended that Pegasys pre-filled syringes be used for children and 
adolescents, as they allow for dose adjustments.  Do not exceed the recommended dose. </p>
<p>The duration of combination treatment in children with chronic hepatitis C varies from 6 to 12 months 
depending on the type of virus your child is infected with and their response to therapy. In chronic 
hepatitis B the duration of Pegasys treatment is 48 weeks. Please check with your doctor and follow 
the recommended duration of treatment. Pegasys injection is normally taken at bedtime. </p>
<p>Pegasys is intended for subcutaneous use (under the skin). This means that Pegasys is injected with a 
short needle into the fatty tissue under the skin in the abdomen or thigh. If you are injecting this 
medicine yourself, you will be instructed how to give the injection. Detailed instructions are provided 
at the end of this leaflet (see  How to inject Pegasys ). </p>
<p>Use Pegasys exactly as described by your doctor, for as long as prescribed by your doctor. 
If you have the impression that the effect of Pegasys is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. </p>
<p>Combination therapy with ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C 
In the case of combination therapy with Pegasys and ribavirin, please follow the dosing regimen 
recommended by your doctor. </p>
<p>Combination therapy with other medicines in chronic hepatitis C 
In the case of combination therapy with Pegasys, please follow the dosing regimen recommended 
by your doctor and refer also to the package leaflets of any other medicines that are used in 
combination with Pegasys. </p>
<p>If you use more Pegasys than you should 
Contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Pegasys 
If you realise you missed your injection 1 or 2 days after it was scheduled, you should inject your 
recommended dose as soon as possible. Take your next injection on the regularly scheduled day. 
If you realise you missed your injection 3 to 5 days after it was scheduled, you should take your 
injection at the recommended dose as soon as possible. Take your next doses at 5 day intervals until 
you return to your regularly scheduled day of the week. 
As an example: Your regular weekly Pegasys injection is on Monday. You remember on 
Friday that you forgot to take your injection on Monday (4 days late). You should inject your 
regularly scheduled dose immediately on Friday and take your next injection on Wednesday 
(5 days after your Friday dose). Your next injection will be on the Monday, 5 days later after 
the Wednesday injection. You are now back on your regularly scheduled day and should 
continue your injections every Monday. 
If you realise you missed your injection 6 days after it was scheduled, you should wait and take your 
dose on the next day, your regularly scheduled day. 
Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you need any help determining how to manage a missed dose of 
Pegasys. </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

adolescents with chronic hepatitis C did not grow or gain weight as much as expected. While most 
children returned to their projected height within two years after completing treatment, and the 
majority of the remaining children within six years after completing treatment, it remains possible 
that Pegasys may affect the final adult height. </p>

<p>a short needle for the subcutaneous injection </p>
<p>a cleansing swab </p>
<p>small bandage or sterile gauze </p>
<p>an adhesive bandage </p>
<p>a container for the waste material </p>
<p>Measuring the dose of Pegasys </p>
<p>Remove the protective cap from the Pegasys vial (1). </p>
<p>Clean the rubber top of the vial with a cleansing swab. 
You can save the swab to clean the skin area where you will inject Pegasys. </p>
<p>Remove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe.  </p>
<p>Take the long needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe (2).  </p>
<p>Remove the needle guard without touching the needle and keep the syringe with the needle in 
your hand. </p>
<p>Insert the needle through the rubber top of the Pegasys vial (3). </p>
<p>Hold the vial and syringe in one hand and turn the vial and the syringe upside down (4). </p>
<p>4 </p>
<p>With the syringe pointing up, make certain that the tip of the needle is in the Pegasys solution. Your 
other hand will be free to move the plunger of the syringe. </p>
<p>Slowly pull back the plunger to withdraw a bit more than the dose prescribed by your doctor 
into the syringe. </p>
<p>Hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up, remove the syringe from the long 
needle while keeping the needle in the vial and without touching the tip of the syringe. </p>
<p>Take the short needle and place it firmly on to the tip of the syringe (5). </p>
<p>Remove the needle guard from the syringe needle. </p>
<p>Check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back. To 
remove air bubbles from the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Tap the 
syringe gently to bring the bubbles to the top. Push the plunger up slowly to the correct dose. 
Replace the needle guard and place the syringe in a horizontal position until ready for use. </p>
<p>Allow the solution to reach room temperature before injection or warm the syringe between 
your palms. </p>
<p>Visually inspect the solution prior to administration: do not use if it is discoloured or if particles 
are present. You are now ready to inject the dose. </p>
<p>Injecting the solution </p>
<p>Select the injection site in the abdomen or thigh (except your navel or waistline). Change your 
injection site each time. </p>
<p>Clean and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made with a cleansing swab. </p>
<p>Wait for the area to dry. </p>
<p>Remove the needle guard. </p>
<p>With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a 
pencil. </p>
<p>Insert the needle all the way into the pinched skin at an angle of 45  to 90  (6). </p>
<p>Inject the solution by gently pushing the plunger all the way down. </p>
<p>Pull the needle straight out of the skin. </p>
<p>Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. </p>
<p>Do not massage the injection site. If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. </p>
<p>Disposal of the injection materials </p>
<p>The syringe, needle and all injection materials are intended for single use and must be discarded after 
the injection. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely in a closed container. Ask your doctor, hospital 
or pharmacist for an appropriate container. </p>
