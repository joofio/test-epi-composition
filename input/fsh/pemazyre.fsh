  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Pemazyre contains the active substance pemigatinib, which belongs to a group of cancer medicines 
called tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It blocks the action of proteins in the cell called fibroblast growth 
factor receptor types 1, 2 and 3 (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3) that help regulate cell growth. Cancer 
cells may have an abnormal form of this protein. By blocking FGFR, pemigatinib can prevent the 
growth of such cancer cells. </p>
<p>Pemazyre is used: 
* to treat adults with bile duct cancer (also known as cholangiocarcinoma) whose cancer cells 
have an abnormal form of the FGFR2 protein, and 
* when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery, and 
* when treatment with other medicines is no longer working. </p>         </div>"""
