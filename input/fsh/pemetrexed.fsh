doctor will make sure that you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and 
after receiving cisplatin to prevent vomiting. </p>

<p>The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Instructions for use, handling and disposal. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use aseptic techniques during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed 
for intravenous infusion administration. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the dose and the number of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi vials needed. Each vial 
contains an excess of pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of the label amount. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi 100 mg:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconstitute each 100 mg vial with 4.2 ml of 5% glucose intravenous infusion 
resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi 500 mg:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconstitute each 500 mg vial with 20 ml of 5% glucose intravenous infusion 
resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is 
clear and ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely 
affecting product quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is required. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 
100 ml with 5% glucose intravenous infusion and administered as an intravenous infusion 
over 10 minutes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl 
chloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. Pemetrexed is 
incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer s Injection and 
Ringer s Injection. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi contains trometamol as an excipient. Trometamol is 
incompatible with cisplatin resulting in degradation of cisplatin. This medicinal product 
must not be mixed with other medicinal products. Intravenous lines should be flushed after 
administration of Pemetrexed Fresenius Kabi </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not 
administer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused product or waste material should 
be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation and administration precautions: As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, 
care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use 
of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately 
and thoroughly with soap and water. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush 
thoroughly with water. Pregnant women must avoid contact with cytostatic medicinal product. 
Pemetrexed is not a vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. </p>
<p>There have been a few reported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as 
serious by the investigator. Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with 
other non-vesicants. </p>
