<p>If you currently have or have previously had problems with your kidneys, talk to your doctor or 
hospital pharmacist as you may not be able to receive Pemetrexed Pfizer. </p>
<p>Before each infusion you will have samples of your blood taken to evaluate if you have sufficient 
kidney and liver function and to check that you have enough blood cells to receive Pemetrexed Pfizer. 
Your doctor may decide to change the dose or delay treating you depending on your general condition 
and if your blood cell counts are too low. If you are also receiving cisplatin, your doctor will make 
sure that you are properly hydrated and receive appropriate treatment before and after receiving 
cisplatin to prevent vomiting. </p>
<p>If you have had or are going to have radiation therapy, please tell your doctor, as there may be an early 
or late radiation reaction with Pemetrexed Pfizer. </p>

medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pemetrexed Pfizer 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for pain or inflammation (swelling), such as 
medicines called “nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs” (NSAIDs), including medicines purchased 
without a doctor’s prescription (such as ibuprofen). There are many sorts of NSAIDs with different 
durations of activity. Based on the planned date of your infusion of pemetrexed and/or on the status of 
your kidney function, your doctor needs to advise you on which medicines you can take and when you 
can take them. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are NSAIDs. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor. The 
use of pemetrexed should be avoided during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the 
potential risk of taking pemetrexed during pregnancy. Women must use effective contraception during 
treatment with pemetrexed and for 6 months after receiving the last dose. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor.<br />
Breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with pemetrexed. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Men are advised not to father a child during and up to 3 months following treatment with pemetrexed 
and should therefore use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed and for up to 
3 months afterwards. If you would like to father a child during the treatment or in the 3 months 
following receipt of treatment, seek advice from your doctor or pharmacist. Pemetrexed Pfizer can 
affect your ability to have children. Talk to your doctor to seek advice about sperm storage before 
starting your therapy. </p>

Pemetrexed Pfizer may make you feel tired. Be careful when driving a car or using machines. </p>
