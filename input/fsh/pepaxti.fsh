<p>Pepaxti is given with the steroid dexamethasone, to treat adults with the blood cancer multiple 
myeloma. It is used when the disease does not respond to at least three types of cancer medicine. If 
you have been treated with a blood stem cell transplant (a procedure where the cells that make your 
blood are cleared out and replaced), the time to when the multiple myeloma came back after 
transplantation should be at least 3 years.  </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to melphalan flufenamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Pepaxti. </p>
<p>Abnormal bleeding and bruising and low number of platelets (blood cells) 
Pepaxti can lower the number of blood cells called platelets that help to clot your blood. Tell your 
doctor or nurse immediately if you start bleeding e.g. a nosebleed or get bruises on your skin.  </p>
<p>Fever and low number of white blood cells 
Pepaxti can lower the number of white blood cells that are important for fighting infections. Tell your 
doctor or nurse immediately if you have symptoms of infection such as fever, chills or cough. </p>
<p>Low number of red blood cells 
Pepaxti can lower the number of red blood cells, which transport oxygen to the cells in your body. 
Your doctor will regularly take blood samples to monitor your blood cells. Tell your doctor or nurse 
immediately if you feel weak or tired, if you look pale or if you feel short of breath.  </p>
<p>Infections 
Infections such as lung infection (pneumonia) and upper respiratory tract infection (causing cold-like 
symptoms) are very common with Pepaxti. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you develop fever 
or other signs of infection. Your doctor might recommend preventive antibiotics to lower the risk of 
developing infections. </p>
<p>Risk of diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting 
You should tell your doctor if you get diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting.  </p>
<p>Risk of development of blood clots 
The use of Pepaxti in combination with dexamethasone may increase the risk of developing blood 
clots. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have ever had a blood clot in a vein (thrombosis). Tell your 
doctor or nurse immediately if you develop a swelling of a leg or an arm, if you find it harder to 
breathe, or experience chest pain. </p>
<p>Risk of additional cancer 
It is important to note that patients with multiple myeloma treated with Pepaxti may develop 
additional types of cancer, therefore your doctor should carefully evaluate the benefit and risk for you 
when you are prescribed this medicine. </p>
<p>Kidney disease 
If you have lowered kidney function, the side effects of Pepaxti on your blood cells may be worse. 
There is too little information available on use of the medicine in patients with severely lowered 
kidney function to be able to recommend a safe and effective dose. </p>
<p>Vaccinations 
Vaccines that contain live but weakened organisms, known as live attenuated vaccines (like measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccines) should not be used while you are being treated with Pepaxti, as they 
may lead to an infection. Some other types of vaccines known as inactivated vaccines or mRNA based 
vaccines can, however, be used. Tell your healthcare provider you are being treated with Pepaxti 
before you get vaccinated. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Pepaxti is not intended for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pepaxti 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
This medicine is not recommended for use during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Avoid 
becoming pregnant while being treated with this medicine as it may harm your unborn baby. Your 
doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of using Pepaxti during pregnancy. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant: 
* Your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start treatment with Pepaxti. 
* You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after your last dose of 
Pepaxti. Talk to your doctor about effective contraception methods that may be right for you. </p>
<p>If you are a man who could father a child: 
* You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after your last dose of 
Pepaxti. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Pepaxti since it may be harmful for your baby.  </p>
<p>Fertility 
Pepaxti can affect ovaries or sperm, which may cause infertility (inability to have a baby). In women, 
menstruation can stop. In men, inability to father a child (sterility) due to lack of sperm can be 
permanent. Ask your doctor for advice on sperm preservation before treatment.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Pepaxti can cause nausea and dizziness, which may reduce your ability to drive or use machines.   </p>         </div>"""

recommended starting dose is 30 mg once every 4 weeks. Treatment will carry on as long as you are 
benefitting from it and do not have unacceptable side effects. As part of your treatment, you will also 
take another medicine, dexamethasone, by mouth. </p>
<p>If you are given more Pepaxti than you should 
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much 
(an overdose) your doctor will check you, including taking blood samples to monitor your blood cells. </p>
