  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Pergoveris is 
Pergoveris contains two different active substances called “follitropin alfa” and “lutropin alfa”. Both 
belong to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”, which are involved in reproduction and 
fertility. </p>
<p>What Pergoveris is used for 
This medicine is used to stimulate the development of follicles (each containing an egg) in your 
ovaries. This is to help you get pregnant. It is for use in adult women (18 years old or above) who have 
low levels (severe deficiency) of “follicle stimulating hormone” (FSH) and “luteinising hormone” 
(LH). These women are usually infertile. </p>
<p>How Pergoveris works 
The active substances in Pergoveris are copies of the natural hormones FSH and LH. In your body: 
* FSH stimulates the production of eggs 
* LH stimulates the release of the eggs. </p>
<p>By replacing the missing hormones, Pergoveris allows women with low levels of FSH and LH to 
develop a follicle. This will then release an egg, after an injection of the hormone “human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG)”. This helps the women to become pregnant. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Do not use Pergoveris 
* if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
* if you have a brain tumour (in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland) 
* if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding </li>
<li>if you have cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts </li>
<li>if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as an early 
menopause, malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pergoveris. </p>
<p>Porphyria 
Talk to your doctor before you start your treatment.If you or any member of your family have 
porphyria (an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if: 
* your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently exposed 
to sunlight 
* you have stomach, arm or leg pain. </p>
<p>In case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine stimulates your ovaries. This increases your risk of developing ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This is when your follicles develop too much and become large 
cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you 
have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away. They might ask you to stop using this 
medicine (see in section 4. under “Most serious side effects”). </p>
<p>In case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered 
to, the occurrence of severe OHSS is less likely. Pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe OHSS. 
This becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human 
chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered (see in section 3. under “How much to use” for details). 
If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you 
may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four 
days. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ensure, careful monitoring of the ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood 
tests (oestradiol measurements) before and during the course of treatment. </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy 
When using Pergoveris, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Pergoveris at the right times. </p>
<p>To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended. </p>
<p>Miscarriage 
When undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a 
miscarriage than the average woman. </p>
<p>Ectopic pregnancy 
Women who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes (tubal disease) are at risk of pregnancy 
where the embryo is implanted outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy). This is whether the pregnancy 
is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. </p>
<p>Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood 
clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood 
clots or existing clots might become worse with Pergoveris treatment. </p>
<p>Tumours of sex organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to Pergoveris. If you have ever had 
this type of reaction to a similar medicine, talk to your doctor before using Pergoveris. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Pergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pergoveris 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use Pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa, if 
prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Pergoveris contains sodium 
Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially “sodium-free”. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Using this medicine 
* Pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). To 
minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day. 
* It comes as a powder and liquid, which you need to mix together and then use straight away. 
* Your doctor or nurse will show you how to prepare and inject this medicine. They will 
supervise your first injection. 
* If they are satisfied that you can administer Pergoveris safely, you can then prepare and inject 
the medicine yourself at home. When you do this, please carefully read and follow the 
instructions hereafter called “How to prepare and use the Pergoveris powder and solvent”. </p>
<p>How much to use 
The usual starting dose is one vial of Pergoveris every day. 
* According to your response, your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed 
follitropin alfa preparation to your Pergoveris injection. In this case, the follitropin alfa dose is 
usually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU. 
* Treatment is continued until you get the desired response. This is when you have developed a 
suitable follicle, as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests. 
* This may take up to 5 weeks. </p>
<p>When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) 24 to 48 hours after your last Pergoveris injection. The best time to have sex is on 
the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another 
medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. </p>
<p>If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see in section 2. under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). In this case, your doctor will 
give you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle. </p>
<p>How to prepare and use the Pergoveris powder and solvent 
Before starting the preparation, please read these instructions the whole way through first: 
Give yourself the injection at the same time each day. </p>         </div>"""
