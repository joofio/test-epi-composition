  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>PHEBURANE contains the active substance sodium phenylbutyrate which is used to treat 
patients of all ages with urea cycle disorders. These rare disorders are due to a deficiency of 
certain liver enzymes which are necessary to eliminate waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia. </p>
<p>Nitrogen is a building block of proteins, which are an essential part of the food we eat. As the 
body breaks down protein after eating, waste nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, accumulates 
because the body cannot eliminate it. Ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in 
severe cases, to reduced levels of consciousness and to coma. </p>
<p>This medicine helps the body to eliminate waste nitrogen, reducing the amount of ammonia in 
your body. However PHEBURANE must be used along with a diet reduced in proteins, 
designed especially for you by the doctor and the dietician. You must follow this diet carefully. </p>         </div>"""

<p>are allergic to sodium phenylbutyrate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>are pregnant. </p>
<p>are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PHEBURANE if you: </p>
<p>suffer from congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump 
enough blood around the body) or a decrease in your kidney function. </p>
<p>have decreased kidney or liver function, since PHEBURANE is eliminated from the body 
through the kidney and liver. 
PHEBURANE will not prevent the occurrence of an acute excess of ammonia in the blood, a 
condition which usually constitutes a medical emergency. If this happens you will develop 
symptoms such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), confusion and will need to get 
urgent medical help. </p>
<p>If you need laboratory tests, it is important to remind your doctor that you are taking 
PHEBURANE, since sodium phenylbutyrate may interfere with certain laboratory test results 
(such as blood electrolytes or protein, or liver function tests) </p>
<p>In case of any doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Other medicines and PHEBURANE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing: </p>
<p>valproate (an antiepileptic medicine). </p>
<p>haloperidol (used in certain psychotic disorders). </p>
<p>corticosteroids (medicines that are used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the body), </p>
<p>probenecid (for treatment of hyperuricaemia, high levels of uric acid in the blood, 
associated with gout). </p>
<p>These medicines may change the effect of PHEBURANE and you will need more frequent 
blood tests. If you are uncertain if your medicines contain these substances, you should check 
with your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use PHEBURANE if you are pregnant, because this medicine can harm your unborn 
baby.  </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could get pregnant, you must use reliable contraception, during 
treatment with PHEBURANE. Talk to your doctor for the details. </p>
<p>Do not use PHEBURANE if you are breast-feeding, because this medicine can pass into the 
breast milk and may harm your baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
PHEBURANE is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>PHEBURANE contains sodium and sucrose 
This medicine contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 
each gram granules. This is equivalent to 6,2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary 
intake of sodium for an adult.<br />
The maximum daily dose of this medicine contains 2.5 mg sodium per 20 gram granules. This is 
equivalent to 125% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you need 3 or more grams daily for a prolonged period, 
especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.  </p>
<p>This medicine contains 768 mg sucrose in each gram granules. This should be taken into 
account if you have diabetes mellitus. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.  </p>         </div>"""

pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Dose 
The daily dose of PHEBURANE will be based on your body weight or body surface and 
adjusted according to your protein tolerance and diet. You will need regular blood tests to 
determine the correct daily dose. Your doctor will tell you the amount of granules you should 
take. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
You should take PHEBURANE by mouth. Because it dissolves slowly, PHEBURANE should 
not be administered through a gastrostomy (tube that goes through the abdomen to the stomach) 
or through a nasogastric tube (tube that goes through the nose to the stomach). </p>
<p>PHEBURANE must be taken with a special diet reduced in protein. </p>
<p>You should take PHEBURANE with each meal or feeding. In small children this can be 4 to 6 
times per day. </p>
<p>The doses of PHEBURANE prescribed by your doctor are expressed in grams of sodium 
phenylbutyrate. A calibrated measuring spoon which dispenses up to 3 g of sodium 
phenylbutyrate at a time is provided with the medicine. Only use this measuring spoon to 
measure out the dose of PHEBURANE. The measuring spoon must not be used for any other 
medicine. </p>
<p>To measure the dose: </p>
<p>Lines on the spoon indicate the amount of PHEBURANE in gram of sodium 
phenylbutyrate. Take the correct amount as prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Pour granules directly into the spoon as shown by the picture (on the outer carton and in 
this leaflet). </p>
<p>Tap the spoon once on a table to give a horizontal level of granules and continue filling if 
necessary. </p>
<p>The granules can be directly swallowed with a drink (water, fruit juices, protein-free infant 
formulas) or sprinkled on to a spoonful of solid foods (mashed potatoes or apple sauce). If you 
mix them with food, it is important that you take it immediately. This will keep the granules 
from producing any taste. </p>
<p>You will need to take this medicine and to follow a diet throughout your life. </p>
<p>If you take more PHEBURANE than you should 
Patients who have taken very high doses of sodium phenylbutyrate experienced: </p>
<p>sleepiness, tiredness, light-headedness and less frequently confusion; </p>
<p>headache; </p>
<p>changes in taste (taste disturbances); </p>
<p>decrease in hearing; </p>
<p>disorientation; </p>
<p>impaired memory; </p>
<p>worsening of existing neurological conditions. </p>
<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should immediately contact your doctor or the 
nearest hospital emergency department for supportive treatment. </p>
<p>If you forget to take PHEBURANE 
You should take a dose as soon as possible with your next meal. Make sure that there are at least 
3 hours between two doses. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): irregular menstrual periods 
and stopping of menstrual periods in fertile women. 
If you are sexually active and your period stops altogether, do not assume that this is caused by 
PHEBURANE. If this occurs, please discuss it with your doctor, because the absence of your 
period may be caused by pregnancy (see  Pregnancy and breast-feeding  section above) or by 
menopause.  </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 100 people): changes in number of blood cells 
(red cells, white cells and platelets), changes in the amount of bicarbonate in the blood, reduced 
appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention (swelling), changes in taste 
(taste disturbances), stomach ache, vomiting, nausea, constipation, abnormal skin odour, rash, 
abnormal kidney function, weight gain, altered laboratory test values. </p>
