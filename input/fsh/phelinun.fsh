  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>If you have any doubts, do not hesitate to ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>You must not be given PHELINUN 
- if you are allergic to melphalan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) 
- if you are pregnant (only with respect to the treatment prior to blood stem cell transplantation) 
or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>If you are going to be treated with melphalan careful monitoring of the blood will be performed as this 
medicine is a potent cytotoxic that results in profound decrease of blood cells. </p>
<p>Before treatment with melphalan, tell your doctor if any of the following apply to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you have had recent radiotherapy or cancer medicines because they frequently decrease the 
number of blood cell levels; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have signs of an infection (fever, chills, etc.). In case of treatment with melphalan, your 
doctor may prescribe medicines such as antibiotics, antifungals or antivirals to prevent 
infections. Your doctor may also consider giving you blood products (for example, red blood 
cells and platelets); </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are going to have a vaccination or were recently vaccinated. This is because some live 
attenuated vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) may give you an infection while 
you are being treated with melphalan; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have kidney problems or kidney failure (your kidneys don t work well enough). In this 
case the dose of PHELINUN must be reduced; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you ever had a blood clot in your vein (thrombosis). The use of melphalan in combination 
with lenalidomide and prednisone or thalidomide or dexamethasone may increase the risk of 
development of blood clots. Your doctor can decide to give you medication to prevent the latter 
from happening.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adequate hydration and forced diuresis (large volume of fluids given in the vein by a drip) is 
recommeded when you are given melphalan. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Children and adolescents may be more likely to develop serious breathing and gastrointestinal 
complications. Tell your doctor or nurse at once if any breathing or gastrointestinal disturbances occur. </p>
<p>Melphalan should not be used as a preparation medicine before blood stem cell transplantation, in 
adolescents over the age of 12 years with acute myeloid leukaemia. 
Safety and efficacy of the use of melphalan as a preparation medicine before blood stem cell 
transplantation in children less than 2 years for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia and acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia has not been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and PHELINUN 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following: 
* other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) 
* vaccination or you have been recently vaccinated (see warnings and precautions) because of 
possible general illness which may lead to a fatal outcome<br />
* nalidixic acid (an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections). It can cause haemorrhagic 
enterocolitis with fatal outcome in children when given in combination with melphalan 
* busulfan (used to treat a certain type of cancer). In children, it has been reported that the 
administration of melphalan less than 24 hours after the last oral busulfan administration may 
influence the development of toxicities. </p>
<p>Cases of impaired renal function have been reported when cyclosporin is used to prevent graft-versus-
host disease after blood stem cell transplantion.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
Blood stem cell transplantation is contraindicated in pregnant woman. For the other indications, 
treatment with melphalan is not recommended during pregnancy because it may cause permanent 
damage to the foetus.  </p>
<p>If you are already pregnant, it is important to talk to your doctor before being given melphalan.<br />
You and your doctor will need to consider the risks and benefits of treatment with melphalan to you and 
your baby.  </p>
<p>You must take adequate contraceptive precautions to avoid pregnancy while you or your partner are 
having melphalan and during 6 months thereafter. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if melphalan passes into breast milk. Do not breast-feed during the treatment with 
PHELINUN. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Melphalan can affect ovaries or sperm, which may cause infertility (inability to have a baby).<br />
In women, the ovulation, and as a consequence the menstruation, can stop (amenorrhoea). In men, based 
on findings in animal studies, there may be an absence or low amount of viable sperm cells. Therefore, 
men are advised to have a consultation on sperm preservation before treatment. </p>
<p>Male and female contraception<br />
It is recommended that men and female who are receiving melphalan must use effective contraceptive 
precautions during treatment and up to 6 months afterwards.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine can cause nausea and vomiting, which may reduce your ability to drive or use 
machines. This medicine also contains alcohol, which is likely to affect children and adolescents (see 
below for further information). </p>
<p>PHELINUN contains ethanol (alcohol)<br />
This medicine contains 0.4 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each solvent vial, which is equivalent to 42 mg/ml 
(0.42% w/v). The amount in solvent vial of this medicine is equivalent to 10 ml beer or 4 ml wine.  </p>
<p>Adults 
The amount of alcohol in this medicine is not likely to have an effect in adults.  </p>
<p>The amount of alcohol in this medicine may alter the effects of other medicines.<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are using other medicines. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using this medicine. See 
also the information under pregnancy above. 
If you are addicted to alcohol, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The alcohol in this preparation is likely to affect children and adolescents. These effects may include 
feeling sleepy and changes in behaviour. It may also affect their ability to concentrate and take part in 
physical activities. If you have epilepsy or liver problems, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
this medicine.  </p>

If your child is less than 5 years old, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving them this medicine, 
in particular if they use other medicines that contain propylene glycol or alcohol. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast feeding, do not take this medicine unless recommended by your doctor.<br />
See also the information under pregnancy above. </p>
<p>If you suffer from a liver or kidney disease, do not take this medicine unless recommended by your 
doctor. Your doctor may carry out extra checks while you are using this medicine. </p>
<p>Propylene glycol in this medicine can have the same effects as drinking alcohol and increase the 
likelihood of side effects. </p>
<p>Use this medicine only if recommended by a doctor. Your doctor may carry out extra checks while you 
are using this medicine. </p>

<p>Your doctor will calculate the dose of PHELINUN according to your body surface or weight and your 
disease and how well your kidneys are working.  </p>
<p>When PHELINUN is used as a treatment before blood stem cell transplantation, it is always given in 
combination with other medicines. </p>
<p>Use in adults 
The recommended dose range is between 100 and 200 mg/m2 body surface area. The dose can be 
divided equally over 2 or 3 consecutive days.  </p>
<p>Use in paediatric population 
The dose regimen is as follows: one dose between 100 and 240 mg/m2 body surface area. The dose can 
be divided equally over 2 or 3 consecutive days.  </p>
<p>Use in patients with decreased kidney functioning<br />
The dose is usually lower depending on the severity of the kidney problem. </p>
<p>Administration<br />
PHELINUN will be given by infusion (drip) into your vein.  </p>
<p>If PHELINUN is accidentally infused outside the vein and into the surrounding tissue or leaks from the 
vein into the surrounding tissue, the administration of PHELINUN should be interrupted immediately 
because it can cause severe tissue damage. This usually results in pain such as stinging and burning. If 
the patients cannot express that they experience pain, it should be observed if other signs such as redness 
and swelling of the injection site occur.  </p>
