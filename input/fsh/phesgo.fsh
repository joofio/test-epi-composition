  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Phesgo is a cancer medicine that contains two active substances: pertuzumab and trastuzumab. 
* Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are ‘monoclonal antibodies’. They are designed to attach to a 
specific target on cells called “human epidermal growth factor receptor 2” (HER2). 
* HER2 is found in large amounts on the surface of some cancer cells and stimulates their growth. <br />
* By attaching to HER2 on cancer cells, pertuzumab and trastuzumab slow down their growth, or 
kill them. </p>
<p>Phesgo is available in two different strengths. See section 6 for more information. </p>
<p>Phesgo is used to treat adult patients with breast cancer that is of the “HER2-positive” type – your 
doctor will test you for this. It can be used when: 
* the cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver (metastasised), or the 
cancer has come back in the breast and the area around breast, but cannot be operated, and no 
treatment with cancer medicines (chemotherapy) or other medicines designed to attach to HER2 
has been given. 
* the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body, and treatment is going to be  given either 
before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) or after surgery (adjuvant therapy). </p>
<p>As part of your treatment with Phesgo you will also receive other medicines called chemotherapy. 
Information about these medicines is described in separate package leaflets. Ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse to give you information about these other medicines. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to pertuzumab, trastuzumab, or to any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Phesgo </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Heart problems </p>
<p>Treatment with Phesgo may affect the heart. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are 
given Phesgo if: 
* you have ever had heart problems (such as heart failure, treatment for serious irregular heart 
beats, uncontrolled high blood pressure, recent heart attack).Your doctor will run tests to check 
if your heart is working properly before and during treatment with Phesgo. 
* you have ever had heart problems during previous treatment with a medicine containing 
trastuzumab. 
* you have ever had a chemotherapy medicine from the class of cancer medicines called 
anthracyclines, e.g. doxorubicin or epirubicin – these medicines can damage heart muscle and 
increase the risk of heart problems with Phesgo. 
* you have ever had a radiotherapy to the chest area, as it can increase the risk of heart problems.<br />
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are 
given Phesgo. See section 4 “Serious side effects” for more details about signs of heart problems to 
look out for. </p>
<p>Injection reactions </p>
<p>A reaction to the injection can happen. These are allergic reactions and can be severe. </p>
<p>If you get any serious reaction, your doctor may stop treatment with Phesgo. See section 4 ‘‘Serious 
side effects’’ for more details about injection related reactions to look out for during the injection and 
thereafter. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will check for side effects during your injection and for: 
* 30 minutes after the first injection of Phesgo.<br />
* 15 minutes after subsequent injection of Phesgo.<br />
If you get any serious reaction, your doctor may stop treatment with Phesgo.  </p>
<p>Low levels of white blood cells and fever (Febrile neutropenia)  </p>
<p>When Phesgo is given with chemotherapy medicines, the number of white blood cells may drop and 
fever may develop. If you have inflammation of the digestive tract (e.g. sore mouth or diarrhoea) you 
may be more likely to develop this side effect. If the fever persists for several days, this may be a sign 
of worsening of your condition and you should contact your physician. </p>
<p>Diarrhoea </p>
<p>Treatment with Phesgo may cause severe diarrhoea. Patients over 65 years of age have a higher risk of 
diarrhoea compared with patients younger than 65 years of age.  If you get severe diarrhoea during 
your cancer treatment, your doctor may give you medicines to control diarrhoea. Your doctor may also 
stop your treatment with Phesgo until the diarrhoea is under control. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Phesgo should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because there is no information on 
how it works in this age group. </p>
<p>Elderly patients over<br />
Patients over 65 years of age are more likely to get side effects such as reduced appetite, decrease in 
the number of red blood cells, weight loss, tiredness, loss or altered taste, weakness, numbness, 
tingling or prickling sensations mainly affecting the feet and legs and diarrhoea, compared to patients 
younger than 65 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Phesgo </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception </p>
<p>Before starting treatment, you must tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are pregnant or breast-
feeding, or if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. They will discuss with 
you the benefits and risks for you and your baby of taking Phesgo while you are pregnant. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor straight away, if you get pregnant during treatment with Phesgo or during the 
7 months after stopping treatment. Phesgo may harm the unborn baby. You should use effective 
contraception during treatment with Phesgo and for 7 months after stopping treatment. </li>
<li>Ask your doctor about whether you can breast-feed during or after treatment with Phesgo.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Phesgo may affect your ability to drive  or operate machines. If during treatment you experience 
symptoms, such as feeling dizzy, chills, fever or any injection or allergic reactions as described in 
section 4, you should not drive or use machines until these symptoms disappear. </p>
<p>Phesgo contains Sodium </p>
<p>Phesgo contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially sodium-free. </p>         </div>"""

* Injections will be given every three weeks. 
* You will get the injection first in one thigh and then in the other. You will keep getting the 
injection in one thigh then the other. 
* Your doctor or nurse will make sure that each injection is given in a new place (at least 2.5 cm

<p>Do not stop your treatment with this medicine without talking to your doctor first. It is important that 
you are given the full course of injections at the right time every three weeks. This helps your
