(non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus, when metformin is not suitable or has failed to work 
adequately. This is the diabetes that usually develops in adulthood. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone Actavis helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by 
helping your body make better use of the insulin it produces. Your doctor will check whether 
Pioglitazone Actavis is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone Actavis may be used on its own in patients who are unable to take metformin, and where 
treatment with diet and exercise has failed to control blood sugar or may be added to other therapies 
(such as metformin, sulphonylurea or insulin) which have failed to provide sufficient control of blood 
sugar. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients of Pioglitazone 
Actavis (see section 6 for a list of ingredients). 
- if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past. 
- if you have liver disease. 
- if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight loss, 
nausea or vomiting). 
- if you have or have ever had bladder cancer. 
- if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you start to take this medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems and in particular if you are 
over 75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention 
and swelling, you must also tell your doctor. </li>
<li>if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back 
of the eye). </li>
<li>if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased 
possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Pioglitazone 
Actavis. If this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an 
unplanned pregnancy. </li>
<li>if you have a problem with your liver or heart. Before you start taking Pioglitazone Actavis you 
will have a blood sample taken to check your liver function. This check may be repeated at 
intervals. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or 
previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of 
heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such 
as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you take Pioglitazone Actavis with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood 
sugar could fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). </p>
<p>You may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). </p>
<p>Broken bones 
A higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your 
doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Use in children under 18 years is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pioglitazone Actavis 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>You can usually continue to take other medicines whilst you are being treated with Pioglitazone 
Actavis. However, certain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood:</p>
<ul>
<li>gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) </li>
<li>rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and 
your dose of Pioglitazone Actavis may need to be changed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pioglitazone Actavis with food and drink 
You may take your tablets with or without food. You should swallow the tablets with a glass of water. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Pioglitazone will not affect your ability to drive or use machines but take care if you experience 
abnormal vision. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone Actavis contains lactose monohydrate 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking Pioglitazone Actavis. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The usual starting dose is one tablet of 15 mg or of 30 mg of pioglitazone to be taken once daily. Your 
doctor may increase the dose to a maximum of 45 mg once a day. Your doctor will tell you the dose to 
take. 
If you have the impression that the effect of Pioglitazone Actavis is too weak, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone Actavis can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>When Pioglitazone Actavis is taken in combination with other medicines used to treat diabetes (such 
as insulin, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide) your doctor will tell you whether 
you need to take a smaller dose of your medicines. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to have blood tests periodically during treatment with Pioglitazone Actavis. 
This is to check that your liver is working normally. </p>
<p>If you are following a diabetic diet, you should continue with this while you are taking Pioglitazone 
Actavis. </p>
<p>Your weight should be checked at regular intervals; if your weight increases, inform your doctor. </p>
<p>If you take more Pioglitazone Actavis than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, talk to a 
doctor or pharmacist immediately. Your blood sugar could fall below the normal level and can be 
increased by taking sugar. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or 
sugary fruit juice. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Pioglitazone Actavis 
Take Pioglitazone Actavis daily as prescribed. However if you miss a dose, just carry on with the next 
dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. 
For the 14, 28, 56, 84 and 98 tablets pack sizes, you can check the day on which you last took a tablet 
of Pioglitazone Actavis by referring to the calendar printed on the blister. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Pioglitazone Actavis<br />
Pioglitazone Actavis should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using Pioglitazone 
Actavis, your blood sugar may go up. Talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
