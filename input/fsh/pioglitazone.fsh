insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus in adults, when metformin is not suitable or has failed to work 
adequately. This is the diabetes that usually develops in adulthood. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone Accord helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by 
helping your body make better use of the insulin it produces. Your doctor will check whether 
Pioglitazone Accord is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone Accord may be used on its own in patients who are unable to take metformin, and where 
treatment with diet and exercise has failed to control blood sugar or may be added to other therapies 
(such as metformin, sulfonylurea or insulin) which have failed to provide sufficient control of blood 
sugar. </p>         </div>"""
