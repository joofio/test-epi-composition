Piqray contains the active substance alpelisib, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. </p>
<p>What Piqray is used for 
Piqray is used for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with a type of breast cancer 
called advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative breast cancer. Piqray is used in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal anticancer 
therapy, in patients whose cancer has not responded to other hormonal treatments and who have 
certain changes (mutations) in a gene called PIK3CA. </p>
<p>Your doctor will take a sample of your blood and/or tumour tissue, which will be tested for these 
PIK3CA mutations. If the result is positive your cancer is likely to respond to treatment with Piqray. </p>
<p>How Piqray works 
Piqray works by blocking the effects of enzymes called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K). These 
enzymes help cancer cells to grow and multiply. By blocking their action, Piqray can reduce growth 
and spread of the cancer and help to destroy cancer cells. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Piqray works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Piqray. </p>
<p>If any of the following apply to you before taking Piqray, tell your doctor or pharmacist:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have ever had high levels of sugar in your blood or diabetes (or signs of increased 
sugar levels, such as excessive thirst and dry mouth, needing to pass urine more often than 
usual, producing greater amounts of urine than usual, tiredness, nausea, increased appetite with 
weight loss). </li>
<li>if you have ever had Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme (EM), drug 
reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN; possible symptoms include red skin, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, 
with or without fever, rash). </li>
<li>if you have a severe bone disease that affects the jaw (osteonecrosis of the jaw, ONJ). </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the following apply to you during your treatment with Piqray, tell your doctor or pharmacist 
immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rash, itching, hives, breathlessness, difficulty breathing, wheezing, cough, light-headedness, 
dizziness, changes in levels of consciousness, low blood pressure, reddening of the skin, 
swelling of the face or throat, blue discoloration of the lips, tongue or skin (possible signs of 
severe allergic reactions). </li>
<li>New or changing breathing problems such as difficult or painful breathing, cough, rapid 
breathing, blue discoloration of the lips, tongue or skin, hiccups (possible signs of 
non-infectious pneumonitis or pneumonia). </li>
<li>Increased thirst and dry mouth, passing urine more often than usual, tiredness, increased 
appetite with weight loss, confusion, nausea, vomiting, fruity odour on breath, difficulty 
breathing and dry or flushed skin, which may be signs of increased blood sugar levels 
(hyperglycaemia) and its complications. </li>
<li>Rash, reddening of the skin, blistering of the lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, sometimes with 
fever (possible signs of one of the following skin conditions: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), 
erythema multiforme (EM), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)). </li>
<li>New or worsening symptoms affecting your mouth (such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, 
non-healing of mouth sores, or discharge). </li>
<li>Severe diarrhoea or severe abdominal pain or stools with mucus or blood, which may be signs 
of inflammation of your intestine (colitis). 
Your doctor may need to treat these symptoms, temporarily interrupt your treatment, reduce your 
dose, or permanently stop your treatment with Piqray. </li>
</ul>
<p>Blood tests before and during your treatment with Piqray 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before and regularly during treatment with Piqray to monitor 
your blood sugar. Based on the results, your doctor will take any necessary actions, such as 
prescribing a medicine to lower blood sugar levels. If necessary, your doctor may decide to 
temporarily interrupt treatment with Piqray or reduce your Piqray dose to allow your blood sugar to 
decrease. Your doctor may also decide to stop Piqray treatment permanently. </p>
<p>Make sure that you regularly test your blood sugar before you start treatment, during treatment 
and after you stop treatment with Piqray. 
- Your doctor will tell you exactly when and where to have the blood tests. Treatment with Piqray 
may only be started if tests show that you have the right levels of sugar in your blood. This is 
because Piqray can increase sugar in your blood (hyperglycaemia), which could be serious and 
need treatment. Only regular fasting blood tests can tell the doctor if you are developing 
hyperglycaemia. 
- Your doctor will tell you exactly when and where to test your blood sugar. This will be required 
more frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment and especially in the first 2 weeks of treatment 
with Piqray. Afterwards, blood tests will be needed at least once a month, depending on your 
blood sugar levels. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Piqray is not to be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Piqray 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>eltrombopag, a medicine used to treat low platelet count </li>
<li>medicines used to treat breast cancer (such as lapatinib, ribociclib) </li>
<li>everolimus, apalutamide, enzalutamide and mitotane, medicines used to treat certain types of 
cancers </li>
<li>pantoprazole, a medicine used to treat heartburn and reduce the amount of acid produced in your 
stomach </li>
<li>midazolam, a medicine used to for sedation or sleep disturbances </li>
<li>rifampicin, a medicine to treat tuberculosis and some other serious infections </li>
<li>carbamazepine and phenytoin, medicines used to treat seizures or convulsions </li>
<li>St. John s Wort, a herbal product used to treat depression and other conditions </li>
<li>encorafenib, a medicine used to treat a certain type of skin cancer </li>
<li>warfarin, a medicine used reduce the clotting ability of the blood </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether your medicine is one of the medicines listed 
above. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Piqray must not be used by women who are, or may be pregnant or breast-feeding. Piqray may harm 
an unborn baby. If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Women should not breast-feed during treatment and 
for at least 1 week after the last dose of Piqray. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of 
taking Piqray during pregnancy or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will rule out an existing pregnancy 
before starting you on treatment with Piqray. This may include having a pregnancy test. </p>
<p>Women who could become pregnant should use an effective method of birth control during treatment 
and for at least 1 week after stopping Piqray. Ask your doctor about suitable methods. If you think you 
may be pregnant after starting treatment with Piqray, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>During treatment and for at least 1 week after stopping treatment, male patients should use a condom 
for intercourse with female partners who could become pregnant. If the partner of a male patient 
suspects that she has become pregnant during this time, she should inform a doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Treatment with Piqray may lead to tiredness. You should therefore be cautious when driving or using 
machines during your treatment with Piqray. </p>
<p>Piqray contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much Piqray to take 
The usual starting dose of Piqray is 300 mg once daily. Your doctor will decide on the right dose for 
you. </p>
<p>Depending on the dose prescribed, the number of tablets to take is as follows:</p>
<ul>

<li>250 mg dose: one 200 mg tablet and one 50 mg tablet </li>
<li>200 mg dose: one 200 mg tablet </li>
</ul>
<p>If you vomit after you take the Piqray tablet(s), do not take any more tablets until your next scheduled 
dose. </p>
<p>Your doctor will determine the dose of fulvestrant you should receive and when you should receive it. </p>
<p>Depending on how your body responds to the treatment with Piqray, your doctor may want to adjust 
your Piqray dose. It is very important to follow your doctor s instructions. If you have certain side 
effects, your doctor may ask you to change to a lower dose, to interrupt treatment for a time, or to stop 
treatment. </p>
<p>When to take Piqray 
Piqray tablets are supplied in packs containing blister cards. Each blister card shows the tablet(s) to be 
taken on each day of the week. Follow the instructions on the blister card. </p>
<p>Take Piqray once a day, immediately after food. Taking Piqray at the same time each day will help 
you to remember when to take your medicine. </p>
<p>How to take Piqray 
Piqray tablets should be swallowed whole, they should not be chewed, crushed or split before 
swallowing. You should not swallow any tablet that is broken, cracked or otherwise damaged as you 
may not be taking the full dose. </p>
<p>How long to take Piqray 
Take Piqray for as long as your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>This is a long-term treatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor 
your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. </p>
<p>If you have questions about how long to take Piqray, talk to your doctor or to your pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you take more Piqray than you should 
People who have taken too many Piqray tablets have experienced effects that are known side effects of 
Piqray, including high blood sugar levels, nausea, tiredness and rash. If you accidentally take too many 
tablets, or if someone else accidentally takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for advice 
immediately. Medical treatment may be necessary. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Piqray 
If you forget to take a dose of Piqray, you may still take it, immediately after food, up to 9 hours after 
the time you should have taken it. If you only remember more than 9 hours after you should have 
taken it, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take the dose at your usual time. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for the one that you missed. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Piqray 
Stopping your treatment with Piqray may cause your condition to become worse. Do not stop taking 
Piqray unless your doctor tells you to stop. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of Piqray, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
