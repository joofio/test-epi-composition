- if you are allergic to pixantrone dimaleate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
- if you have recently received a vaccine. 
- if you have been told that you have persistent, long-term low numbers of red blood cells, white 
blood cells, and platelets. 
- if you have very severe liver problems. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Pixuvri:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have been told that your white blood cell count is very low. </li>
<li>if you have heart disease or uncontrolled high blood pressure, especially if you have ever been 
told you had heart failure or if you have had a heart attack within the last six months. </li>
<li>if you have an infection. </li>
<li>if you have ever been treated for cancer.  </li>
<li>if you follow a specific sodium restricted diet. </li>
<li>if you are taking other medicines which could interact with Pixuvri (see  Taking other 
medicines  below). </li>
</ul>
<p>Skin sensitivity to sunlight 
During treatment with pixantrone, you should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial 
sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment). If you will be exposed to sunlight, you should wear sun- protective clothing and use sunscreen that strongly absorbs UV-A. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 18 years because there is no information about 
Pixuvri treatment in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pixuvri 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is 
extremely important as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken their 
effect. Pixuvri must not be used with other medicines unless your doctor has told you it is safe to do 
so. 
In particular, make sure to tell your doctor if you are currently using, or have recently used, any of the 
following medicines: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you take medicines such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warfarin to prevent blood clot formation </li>
<li>Theophylline to treat lung conditions like emphysema or asthma </li>
<li>Amitriptyline to treat depression </li>
<li>Olanzapine, Clozapine to treat schizophrenia or maniac depression </li>
<li>Haloperidol to treat anxiety and sleeplessness </li>
<li>Ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy </li>
<li>Propranolol to treat high blood pressure </li>
</ul>
<p>Pixuvri with food and drink 
You do not have to change your diet after treatment with Pixuvri unless instructed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pixuvri must not be given to pregnant women as it may cause harm to unborn babies. If you are 
pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Adequate contraceptive precautions must be used when receiving Pixuvri and for up to 6 months after 
treatment. This applies to women who can become pregnant and men receiving Pixuvri who may be 
able to father a child. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while you are being treated with Pixuvri.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not known whether Pixuvri has an effect on your ability to drive a car or use machines. </p>
<p>Pixuvri contains sodium 
Upon reconstitution and dilution, this medecine contains approximately 1g (43 mmol) sodium (main 
component of cooking salt)  per dose. This is equivalent to 50% of the recommended maximum daily 
dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  </p>         </div>"""
