  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Plegridy is 
The active substance in Plegridy is peginterferon beta-1a. Peginterferon beta-1a is a modified 
long-acting form of interferon. Interferons are natural substances made in the body to help protect 
from infections and diseases.  </p>
<p>What Plegridy is used for 
This medicine is used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults aged 18 or 
over.<br />
MS is a long term illness that affects the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal 
cord, in which the body’s immune system (its natural defences) damages the protective layer (myelin) 
that surrounds the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. This disrupts the messages between the brain 
and other parts of the body, causing the symptoms of MS. Patients with relapsing-remitting MS have 
periods when the disease is not active (remission) in between flare-ups of symptoms (relapses). </p>
<p>Everyone has their own set of MS symptoms. These can include: 
- Feeling off-balance or light headed, walking problems, stiffness and muscle spasms, tiredness, 
numbness in the face, arms or legs 
- Acute or chronic pain, bladder and bowel problems, sexual problems and problems with vision 
- Difficulty thinking and concentrating, depression. </p>
<p>How Plegridy works 
Plegridy seems to work by stopping the body’s immune system from damaging your brain and 
spinal cord. This can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling 
effects of MS. Treatment with Plegridy can help to prevent you from getting worse, although it will 
not cure MS. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to peginterferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1a or any of the ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). See section 4 for the symptoms of an allergic reaction. 
- If you have severe depression or think about committing suicide. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor if you have ever had: 
- Depression or problems affecting your mood 
- Thoughts about committing suicide 
- Your doctor may still prescribe Plegridy for you, but it’s important to let your doctor know 
if you have had depression or any similar problems affecting your mood in the past. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before injecting Plegridy if you have any of the 
conditions listed below. They may get worse while using Plegridy:<br />
- Serious liver or kidney problems 
- Irritation at an injection site, which can lead to skin and tissue damage (injection site 
necrosis). When you are ready to inject, carefully follow the instructions in section 7 
“Instructions for injecting Plegridy pre-filled syringe”, at the end of this leaflet. This is to reduce 
the risk of injection site reactions. 
- Epilepsy or other seizure disorders, not controlled by medicine 
- Heart problems, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain (angina), particularly after any 
activity; swollen ankles, shortness of breath (congestive heart failure); or an irregular heartbeat 
(arrhythmia). 
- Thyroid problems 
- A low number of white blood cells or platelets, which can cause an increased risk of infection, 
or bleeding </p>
<p>Other things to consider when using Plegridy 
- You will need blood tests to determine your numbers of blood cells, blood chemistry and your 
levels of liver enzymes. These will be performed before you start using Plegridy, regularly after 
treatment with Plegridy has been initiated and then periodically during treatment, even if you 
have no particular symptoms. These blood tests will be in addition to the tests which are 
normally done to monitor your MS. 
- The functioning of your thyroid gland will be checked regularly or whenever thought necessary 
by your doctor. 
- Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could 
affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Plegridy. 
Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of 
your kidneys. </p>
<p>If you accidentally prick yourself or someone else with the needle in Plegridy, the area affected should 
be washed immediately with soap and water and a doctor or nurse should be contacted as soon as 
possible. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Plegridy is not to be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old. The safety and effectiveness 
of Plegridy in this age group are not known. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Plegridy 
Plegridy should be used carefully with medicines that are broken down in the body by a group of 
proteins called “cytochrome P450” (e.g. some medicines used for epilepsy or depression). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, especially those used to treat epilepsy or depression. This includes any medicines obtained 
without a prescription. </p>
<p>Sometimes you will need to remind other healthcare professionals that you are being treated with 
Plegridy. For example, if you are prescribed other medicines, or if you have a blood test. Plegridy may 
affect the other medicines or the test result. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.<br />
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Plegridy can be used during breast-
feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Plegridy has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Plegridy contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg), that is to say it is essentially “sodium-free”. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The usual dose 
One injection of Plegridy 125 micrograms every 14 days (every two weeks). Try to use Plegridy at the 
same time on the same day, every time you inject. </p>
<p>Starting Plegridy 
If you are new to Plegridy, your doctor may advise you to gradually increase your dose so that you can 
adjust to the effects of Plegridy before taking the full dose. You will be provided with an Initiation 
Pack containing your first 2 injections: one orange syringe with Plegridy 63 micrograms (for day 0) 
and one blue syringe with Plegridy 94 micrograms (for day 14). </p>
<p>After that you will be provided with a maintenance pack containing grey syringes with Plegridy 
125 micrograms (for day 28 and then every two weeks). </p>
<p>Read the instructions in section 7 “Instructions for injecting Plegridy pre-filled syringe” at the end of 
this leaflet before you start using Plegridy. 
Use the record table printed on the inside of the lid of the Initiation Pack to keep a track of your 
injection dates. </p>
<p>Injecting yourself 
Plegridy is to be injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Alternate the sites you use for 
injections. Do not use the same injection site for consecutive injections. </p>
<p>You can inject Plegridy yourself without the help of your doctor, if you have been trained how to do 
this.<br />
- Read and follow the advice given in the instructions in section 7 “Instructions for injecting 
Plegridy pre-filled syringe” before you start.<br />
- If you have trouble handling the syringe, ask your doctor or nurse who may be able to help. </p>
<p>How long to use Plegridy 
Your doctor will tell you how long you need to keep using Plegridy. It is important to continue using 
Plegridy regularly. Do not make changes unless your doctor tells you. </p>
<p>If you use more Plegridy than you should 
You must only inject Plegridy once every 2 weeks.<br />
- If you have used more than one injection of Plegridy in a 7-day period, contact your doctor or 
nurse straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Plegridy 
You need to inject Plegridy once every 2 weeks. This regular schedule helps to deliver the treatment as 
evenly as possible.  </p>
<p>If you do miss your usual day, inject as soon as you can and carry on as usual. However, do not inject 
more than once in a 7-day period. Do not use two injections to make up for a missed injection.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
