  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Plenadren contains a substance called hydrocortisone (sometimes called cortisol). Hydrocortisone is a 
glucocorticoid. It belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids occur 
naturally in the body, and help to maintain your general health and well-being.
Plenadren is used in adults to treat a condition known as adrenal insufficiency, or cortisol deficiency. 
Adrenal insufficiency occurs when your adrenal glands (just above your kidneys) do not produce 
enough of the hormone cortisol. Patients suffering from long-term (chronic) adrenal insufficiency need 
a replacement therapy to survive.
Plenadren replaces the natural cortisol that is missing in adrenal insufficiency. The medicine delivers 
hydrocortisone to your body throughout the day. The cortisol levels in your blood increase rapidly to a 
maximum level, about 1 hour after taking the tablet in the morning, and then gradually decrease over 
the day with no or almost no cortisol level in the blood in the late evening and night when the levels 
should be low.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Plenadren
-
when you have a condition that makes you unable to take this medicine or when the medicine is 
not absorbed properly from your stomach. This may happen when you have stomach problems 
involving vomiting and/or diarrhoea. In these situations you should seek immediate medical 
care in order to receive treatment with injections of hydrocortisone and extra fluid 
administration.
-
if you have short-term or temporary illness such as infections, fever or situations causing a great 
amount of physical stress, such as surgery: your dose of hydrocortisone must be temporarily 
increased. Ask your doctor promptly for information on how you should handle these situations. 
If you are to have surgery, tell your doctor/dentist before the surgery that you are taking this 
medicine.
-
if for any other reason your general health is declining although you take your medicine as 
prescribed; seek immediate medical care.
-
if you have pheochromocytoma (a rare tumour of the adrenal glands). 
-
if your thyroid gland is not working normally tell your doctor since your dose of Plenadren may 
need to be adjusted.
Children and adolescents
Plenadren is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old as it has not 
been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Plenadren
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. During long term treatment with medicines treating infections (antibiotics) the dose of 
Plenadren may need adjustment by your doctor. If used with mifepristone, a treatment used to end a 
pregnancy, the effect of Plenadren may be reduced.
In addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any of the following medicines, as the dose 
of Plenadren may need to be changed:</p>
<p>Phenytoin, carbamazepine and barbiturates - used to treat epilepsy</p>
<p>Rifampicin or rifabutin - used to treat tuberculosis</p>
<p>Ritonavir, efavirenz and nevirapine   used to treat HIV infection</p>
<p>St. John s wort - used to treat depression and other conditions</p>
<p>Ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole - used to treat fungal infections</p>
<p>Erythromycin, telithromycin and clarithromycin - used to treat bacterial infections
Plenadren with food and drink
Do not take this medicine with grapefruit juice as the juice will conflict with the action of this 
medicine.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is important that you continue treatment with Plenadren during pregnancy. Treatment in pregnant 
women with adrenal insufficiency is unlikely to cause any harmful effects on the mother and/or the 
baby. You should tell your doctor if you become pregnant as the dose of Plenadren may have to be 
adjusted.
You can breast-feed during Plenadren treatment. Hydrocortisone is excreted in breast milk. Doses of 
hydrocortisone used for replacement therapy are unlikely to have any effect on the child. However, 
talk to your doctor if you plan to breast-feed your baby.
Fertility in women with adrenal insufficiency or cortisol deficiency may be reduced. There is no 
indication that Plenadren, in doses used for replacement therapy, will have an effect on fertility.
Driving and using machines
This medicine may have minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Extreme tiredness 
and episodes of short-lasting dizziness (vertigo) have been reported. Poorly treated or untreated 
adrenal insufficiency reduces your ability to concentrate and will affect your ability to drive and use 
machines. It is therefore important to take this medicine as directed by your doctor when driving or 
using machines. If you are affected do not drive or use machines, until you have discussed the issue 
with your doctor.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is specific for you and is decided by your doctor.</p>
<p>When you wake up in the morning swallow Plenadren tablets whole with a glass of water at 
least 30 minutes before your breakfast, preferable between 6.00 am and 8.00 am in the morning.</p>
<p>You should preferably be in an upright position.</p>
<p>Do not divide, crush or chew the tablets. These tablets deliver hydrocortisone to your body 
throughout the day. If divided, crushed or chewed this may prevent the hydrocortisone dose in 
the tablet to cover the whole day, as it should.
The need for additional doses of Plenadren
During short-term or temporary illnesses such as infection, fever, or physical stress such as surgery you 
will need more hydrocortisone since the body cannot produce the additional amount of cortisol required 
in these situations. The dose must therefore be increased temporarily and your doctor may advise you to 
use other hydrocortisone tablets instead of, or in addition to Plenadren. Please discuss this with your 
doctor and follow the instructions on how to act in these situations.
The daily dose of Plenadren may have to be doubled or tripled in milder conditions such as a mild 
infection or stress. You should then take the second dose of this medicine 6 to 10 hours after the morning 
dose. If it is not enough to double the daily dose, you should take a third dose 6 to 10 hours after the 
second dose (6-10 hour intervals between doses). When your illness is over, return to your normal 
maintenance dose of this medicine.
The following signs and symptoms may suggest that you need to take additional doses of Plenadren or 
other forms of hydrocortisone: fatigue, weight loss, stomach discomfort, feeling light headed when you 
change from sitting to standing or dizziness when standing, darkening of your skin particularly skin 
creases and exposed areas. Contact your doctor promptly for advice if you notice any of these.
However, seek immediate medical help if you notice any of the following: severe weakness, fainting, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain, confusion, reduced consciousness, delirium (very 
confused state).
If you take more Plenadren than you should
A too high dose of this medicine for more than a few days may be harmful to your health. Your blood 
pressure may increase, you may gain extra weight and your blood sugar may become too high. An 
increased dose is necessary occasionally in order for the body to cope with increased stress such as 
fever. If extra doses are needed frequently and regularly, you should contact your doctor for 
re-evaluation of your maintenance dose.
If you forget to take Plenadren
If you have forgotten to take your tablet in the morning, take it as soon as possible thereafter. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you experience any signs or symptoms listed in 
the section  The need for additional doses of Plenadren , contact your doctor immediately.
If you stop taking Plenadren
Stopping Plenadren may be life threatening. It is therefore important to continue taking this medicine
as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking it without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
