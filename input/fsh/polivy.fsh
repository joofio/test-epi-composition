<p>Polivy is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance  polatuzumab vedotin . </p>
<p>It is always used together with other cancer medicines   see below  What other medicines is Polivy 
given with . </p>
<p>What Polivy is used for </p>
<p>Polivy is given to treat  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  that has never been treated before. </p>
<p>Polivy is also given to treat  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  that has come back or has not got better: 
* after at least one previous therapy, and 
* when you cannot receive a stem cell transplant.  </p>
<p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  is a cancer that comes from  B lymphocytes  also called B-cells. 
These are a type of blood cells.  </p>
<p>How Polivy works </p>
<p>Polivy contains something called a  monoclonal antibody and a substance that can kill cancer called 
 MMAE .<br />
<em> The  monoclonal antibody  part of the medicine attaches to a target on B cells.<br />
</em> Once attached to B cells, the medicine releases  MMAE  into the B cells and kills them. </p>
<p>What other medicines Polivy is given with </p>
<p>Polivy is given in combination with other cancer medicines:<br />
* rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone for  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma<br />
that has never been treated before. 
* rituximab and bendamustine for  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  that has come back or has not 
got better, after at least one previous therapy   and when you cannot receive a stem cell 
transplant. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to polatuzumab vedotin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).  </li>
<li>if you currently have an active severe infection. 
If the above applies to you, you must not be given Polivy. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
nurse before you are given Polivy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Polivy if any of the following apply to you (or you 
are not sure):  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you have ever had brain or nerve problems such as:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>memory problems </p>
</li>
<li>difficulty moving or sensations in your body such as feeling pins and needles, burning, 
pain and discomfort even from slight touch </li>
<li>eyesight problems </li>
<li>you have ever had liver problems </li>
<li>you think you have an infection or have had long-lasting or repeated infections such as herpes 
(see  Infections  in section 4) </li>
<li>you are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given 
Polivy.  </p>
<p>Pay attention to the following side effects </p>
<p>Polivy can cause some serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight 
away. These include:  </p>
<p>Myelosuppression </p>
<p>Myelosuppression is a condition in which the production of blood cells is decreased, resulting in fewer 
red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your blood 
cell count.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you:<br />
<em> develop chills or shivering 
* have a fever 
* have headaches 
* feel tired 
* feel dizzy 
* look pale<br />
</em> have unusual bleeding, bruising under the skin, bleeding longer than usual after your blood has 
been drawn, or bleeding from your gums. </p>
<p>Peripheral neuropathy </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any problems with a change in the sensitivity of 
your skin, especially in your hands or feet, such as: 
* numbness 
* tingling 
* a burning sensation 
* pain 
* discomfort or weakness 
* difficulty walking. </p>
<p>If you had any of these symptoms before treatment with Polivy, tell your doctor straight away if you 
notice any changes in them.  </p>
<p>If you have symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, your doctor may lower your dose. </p>
<p>Infections </p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of infections vary between individuals, tell your doctor or nurse straight away if 
you develop symptoms of an infection such as:<br />
<em> fever 
* cough 
* chest pain<br />
</em> tiredness<br />
<em> painful rash<br />
</em> sore throat<br />
<em> burning pain when passing urine<br />
</em> feeling weak or generally unwell. </p>
<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) </p>
<p>PML is a very rare and life threatening infection in the brain, that has occured in one patient treated 
with Polivy together with bendamustine and another medicine called obinutuzumab.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have: 
* memory loss 
* trouble speaking 
* difficulty walking 
* problems with your eyesight. </p>
<p>If you had any of these symptoms before treatment with Polivy, tell your doctor straight away if you 
notice any changes in them. You may need medical treatment. </p>
<p>Tumour lysis syndrome  </p>
<p>Some people may develop unusual levels of some substances (such as potassium and uric acid) in the 
blood caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This is called  tumour lysis 
syndrome . Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will do blood tests to check for the condition. </p>
<p>Infusion-related reactions </p>
<p>Infusion-related reactions, allergic or anaphylactic (more severe allergic) reactions can happen. Your 
doctor or nurse will check for side effects during your infusion and for 30 to 90 minutes afterwards. If 
you get any serious reaction, your doctor may stop treatment with Polivy.  </p>
<p>Liver damage </p>
<p>This medicine can cause inflammation or damage to cells in the liver that affect the normal function of 
the liver. Injured liver cells may leak high amounts of certain substances (liver enzymes and bilirubin) 
into the bloodstream, which can be detected by blood tests.  </p>
<p>In most cases you will not have any symptoms but tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get: 
* yellowing of your skin and of the whites of your eyes (jaundice). </p>
<p>Your doctor will check your blood to test your liver function before and regularly during treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine should not be used in children or young people under the age of 18. This is because 
there is no information about its use in this age group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Polivy  </p>
<p>Other medicines and vaccines </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might start taking any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor or nurse if you are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one 
in the near future. </p>
<p>Contraception (women and men)  </p>
<p>If you are a woman of childbearing age, you must use effective contraception during treatment   and 
for 9 months after the last dose of Polivy. </p>
<p>Men must use contraception during treatment   and for 6 months after the last dose of Polivy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy  </p>
<p>It is important to tell your doctor before and during treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. This is because Polivy can affect your baby s health.  </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine if you are pregnant unless you and your doctor decide that the benefit to you 
outweighs possible risk to the unborn baby.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding  </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while receiving Polivy   and for at least 3 months after the last dose, because small 
amount of Polivy may pass into your breast milk.  </p>
<p>Fertility  </p>
<p>Men are advised to have sperm samples preserved and stored before treatment with this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>Polivy has a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines.<br />
* If you get infusion-related reactions or nerve damage, or if you feel tired, weak or dizzy 
(see section 4) do not drive, cycle or use tools or machines until the reaction stops.  </p>
<p>See section 4 for more information about side effects. </p>
<p>Polivy contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
