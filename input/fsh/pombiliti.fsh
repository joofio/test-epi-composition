Pombiliti is a type of  enzyme-replacement therapy  (ERT) that is used in the treatment of late-onset 
Pompe disease in adults. It contains the active substance  cipaglucosidase alfa . </p>
<p>What it is used for 
Pombiliti is always used with another medicine called miglustat 65 mg hard capsules. It is very 
important that you also read the package leaflet of miglustat 65 mg hard capsules.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>How Pombiliti works 
People with Pompe disease have low levels of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This 
enzyme helps control levels of glycogen (a type of carbohydrate) in the body. </p>
<p>In Pompe disease, high levels of glycogen build up in the muscles of the body. This keeps muscles, 
such as the muscles that help you walk, the muscles under the lungs that help you breathe, and the 
heart muscle, from working properly. </p>
<p>Pombiliti enters the muscle cells that are affected by Pompe disease. When in the cells, the medicine 
works like GAA to help break down glycogen and control its levels. </p>         </div>"""

<p>miglustat </p>
<p>any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* If a previous infusion had to be stopped and could not be restarted due to life threatening 
hypersensitivity reactions. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Pombiliti. </p>
<p>Speak to your doctor or nurse immediately if these apply to you, if you think it might apply to you 
or if you have ever had any such reactions with another enzyme replacement therapy (ERT): 
* allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction)   see section 4 under 
 Possible side effects , below for symptoms of life-threatening reactions. 
* infusion-associated reaction while you are receiving the medicine or in the few hours 
afterwards - see section 4 under  Possible side effects , below for symptoms of life-threatening 
reactions. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor if you have a history of heart or lung disease. These conditions may worsen during 
or immediately after your infusion with Pombiliti. Tell a doctor or nurse immediately if you are 
experiencing shortness of breath, cough, rapid or irregular heartbeat or any other effects from these 
conditions. </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor if you have swelling in your legs or widespread swelling of your body, severe 
skin rash or frothy urine when passing water. Your doctor will decide if your Pombiliti infusion should 
stop, and the doctor will give you appropriate medical treatment. Your doctor will also decide if you 
can continue receiving Pombiliti. </p>
<p>Pre-treatment medications 
Your doctor may give you other medicines before you have Pombiliti. These medicines include: 
* antihistamines and corticosteroids to prevent or help reduce infusion-related reactions. 
* antipyretics to reduce fever. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years old. This is because the effects 
of Pombiliti in conjunction with miglustat in this age group are not known. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pombiliti 
Tell a doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used, or will be using any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, do 
not take this medicine but talk to your doctor or pharmacist immediately for advice before using this 
medicine. </p>
<p>There is no experience with the use of Pombiliti in combination with miglustat during pregnancy. 
* You should not receive Pombiliti and / or take miglustat 65 mg hard capsules if you are pregnant. 
Be sure to tell your doctor immediately if you get pregnant, think that you may be pregnant, or if 
you are planning to become pregnant. There may be risks to the unborn baby. 
* Pombiliti in combination with miglustat should not be given to women who are breast-feeding. A 
decision will need to be made whether to stop treatment or to stop breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Contraception and fertility 
Female patients of childbearing potential must use reliable birth control methods during and for 
4 weeks after stopping both medicines. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You may feel dizzy, sleepy, or have low blood pressure (hypotensive) after having Pombiliti or 
pre-treatment medicines. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Pombiliti contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains 10.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. 
This is equivalent to 0.52% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

intravenous infusion. 
Talk to your doctor if you would like to be treated at home. Your doctor will decide upon evaluation if 
it is safe for you to have home infusion of Pombiliti. If you get any side effects during an infusion of 
Pombiliti, your home infusion staff member may stop the infusion and start appropriate medical 
treatment. </p>
<p>Pombiliti should be used in conjunction with miglustat. You can only use miglustat 65 mg capsules 
with cipaglucosidase alfa. Do NOT use miglustat 100 mg capsules (different product). Follow your 
doctor s instructions and read the package leaflet of miglustat 65 mg hard capsules for their 
recommended dose. </p>
<p>How much Pombiliti is given 
The amount of medicine that you will be given is based on your weight. The recommended dose is 
20 mg for each kg of body weight. 
When and for how long Pombiliti is given 
* You will be treated with Pombiliti once every other week. Miglustat 65 mg capsules are taken on 
the same day as Pombiliti. Refer to the package leaflet of miglustat 65 mg hard capsules for 
information on how to take miglustat. 
* The cipaglucosidase alfa infusion should start 1 hour after taking miglustat 65 mg hard capsules. </p>
<p>In the event of a delay, the start of infusion should not exceed 3 hours from taking miglustat. 
  The infusion of cipaglucosidase alfa lasts approximately 4 hours. </p>

<p>Switching from another enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
If you are currently being treated with another ERT: 
* Your doctor will tell you when to stop the other ERT before starting Pombiliti. 
* Tell your doctor when you completed your last dose. </p>
<p>If you are given more Pombiliti than you should 
If you have difficulty breathing, feel swollen or bloated, or your heart is racing, you may have been 
given too much Pombiliti; tell your doctor straight away. Excessive rate of infusion of Pombiliti could 
result in symptoms related to too much fluid in the body, such as shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, 
or widespread swelling of the body. </p>
<p>If you miss your dose of Pombiliti 
If you have missed an infusion, please contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible to reschedule 
Pombiliti in combination with miglustat 24 hours after miglustat was last taken. </p>
<p>If you stop receiving Pombiliti 
Speak to your doctor if you wish to stop Pombiliti treatment. The symptoms of your disease may
