  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Ponvory is
Ponvory contains the active substance ponesimod. Ponesimod belongs to a group of medicines called 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators.
What Ponvory is used for
Ponvory is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease.
Active disease in RMS is when there are relapses or when MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) results 
show signs of inflammation.
What is multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system).
In MS, the immune system (one of the body s main defence systems) does not work properly. The 
immune system attacks a protective covering of nerve cells called myelin sheath   this causes 
inflammation. This breakdown of the myelin sheath (called demyelination) stops the nerves working 
properly.
Symptoms of MS depend on which part of the brain and spinal cord are affected. These can include 
problems with walking and balance, weakness, numbness, double vision and blurring, poor 
coordination and bladder problems.
Symptoms of a relapse may disappear completely when the relapse is over   but some problems may 
remain.
How Ponvory works
Ponvory reduces circulating lymphocytes, which are white blood cells involved in the immune system.
It does this by keeping them in the lymphoid organs (lymph nodes). This means that fewer
lymphocytes are available to attack the myelin sheath around the nerves in the brain and spinal cord.
Decreasing nerve damage in patients with MS reduces the number of attacks (relapses) and slows 
down worsening of the disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>you are allergic to ponesimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).</p>
<p>your healthcare professional has told you that you have a severely weakened immune system</p>
<p>you have had a heart attack, chest pain called unstable angina, stroke or mini-stroke (transient 
ischaemic attack, TIA), or certain types of heart failure in the last 6 months</p>
<p>if you have certain types of heart block (abnormal heart tracing on an ECG (electrocardiogram), 
usually with a slow heartbeat) or irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), unless you have 
a pacemaker.</p>
<p>you have severe active infection or active chronic infection</p>
<p>you have active cancer</p>
<p>you have moderate or severe liver problems</p>
<p>you are pregnant or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.
If you are not sure if you have any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor before taking Ponvory.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Ponvory if:</p>
<p>you have an irregular or abnormal or slow heartbeat</p>
<p>you have ever had a stroke or other diseases related to blood vessels in the brain</p>
<p>you have ever suddenly passed out or fainted (syncope)</p>
<p>you have a fever or infection</p>
<p>you have an immune system that does not work properly due to a disease or taking medicines 
that weaken your immune system.</p>
<p>you have never had chickenpox (varicella) or have not received a vaccine for chickenpox. Your 
doctor may do a blood test for chickenpox virus. You may need to get the full course of vaccine 
for chickenpox and then wait 1 month before you start taking Ponvory.</p>
<p>you have breathing problems (such as severe respiratory disease, pulmonary fibrosis or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease)</p>
<p>you have liver problems</p>
<p>you have diabetes. The chance of developing macular oedema (see below) is higher in patients 
with diabetes.</p>
<p>you have eye problems   especially an inflammation of the eye called uveitis</p>
<p>you have high blood pressure.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before taking Ponvory.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get any of the following side effects while taking Ponvory:
Slow heart rate (bradycardia or bradyarrhythmia)
Ponvory can slow down your heart rate   especially after you take your first dose. You should have an 
electrocardiogram (ECG, to check your heart s electrical activity) before you take your first dose of 
Ponvory or before you restart Ponvory after an interruption in treatment.</p>
<p>If you are at increased risk for side effects due to a slowing of your heart rate, your doctor may 
monitor your heart rate and blood pressure for at least 4 hours after taking your first dose of 
Ponvory.</p>
<p>You will also have an ECG at the end of the 4 hours. If you still have a very slow or decreasing 
heart rate, you may need to be monitored until these have resolved.
Infections
Ponvory can increase your risk of serious infections that can be life-threatening. Ponvory lowers the 
number of lymphocytes in your blood. These cells fight infection. Their numbers usually return to 
normal within 1 week of stopping treatment. Your doctor should review a recent blood test of your 
blood cells before you start taking Ponvory.
Call your doctor straight away if you have any of these symptoms of an infection during treatment 
with Ponvory or 1 week after your last dose of Ponvory:</p>
<p>fever</p>
<p>tiredness</p>
<p>body aches</p>
<p>chills</p>
<p>nausea</p>
<p>vomiting</p>
<p>headache with fever, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, nausea, confusion, (these may be 
symptoms of meningitis, an infection of the lining around your brain and spine).
Macular oedema
Ponvory can cause a problem with your vision called macular oedema (build-up of fluid in the back of 
the eye (retina) that may cause changes in vision, including blindness).
The symptoms of macular oedema can be similar to vision symptoms of a MS attack (called optic 
neuritis). Early on, there may not be any symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor about any changes in 
your vision. If macular oedema happens, it usually starts in the first 6 months after you start taking 
Ponvory.
Your doctor should check your vision before you start taking Ponvory and also anytime you notice 
vision changes during treatment. Your risk of macular oedema is higher if you have diabetes or have 
had an inflammation of your eye called uveitis.
Call your doctor straight away if you have any of the following:</p>
<p>blurriness or shadows in the centre of your vision</p>
<p>a blind spot in the centre of your vision</p>
<p>sensitivity to light</p>
<p>unusually coloured (tinted) vision.
Liver problems
Ponvory may cause liver problems. Your doctor should do blood tests to check your liver function
before you start taking Ponvory.
Call your doctor straight away if you have any of the following symptoms of liver problems:</p>
<p>nausea</p>
<p>vomiting</p>
<p>stomach pain</p>
<p>tiredness</p>
<p>loss of appetite</p>
<p>your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow</p>
<p>dark urine.
Increased blood pressure
As Ponvory can increase your blood pressure, your doctor should check your blood pressure regularly 
during treatment with Ponvory.
Exposure to the sun and protection against the sun
As Ponvory may increase the risk of skin cancer, you should limit your exposure to sunlight and UV 
(ultraviolet) light, by:</p>
<p>wearing protective clothing</p>
<p>regularly applying sunscreen with high sun protection factor.
Breathing problems
Some people who take Ponvory have shortness of breath. Call your doctor straight away if you have 
new or worsening breathing problems.
Swelling and narrowing of the blood vessels in your brain
A condition called PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) has happened with 
medicines acting similarly to Ponvory. Symptoms of PRES usually improve when you stop taking 
Ponvory. However, if left untreated, it may lead to a stroke.
Call your doctor straight away if you have any of the following symptoms:</p>
<p>sudden severe headache</p>
<p>sudden confusion</p>
<p>sudden loss of vision or other changes in your vision</p>
<p>seizure.
Worsening of multiple sclerosis after stopping Ponvory
When Ponvory is stopped, symptoms of MS may return. They may be worse compared to before or 
during treatment. Always talk to your doctor before you stop taking Ponvory. Tell your doctor if you 
have worsening symptoms of MS after stopping Ponvory.
Children and adolescents
Ponvory has not been studied in children and adolescents, therefore it is not recommended for use in 
children and adolescents aged less than 18 years.
Other medicines and Ponvory
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
including prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. 
Especially tell your doctor if you take:</p>
<p>medicines to control your heart rhythm (antiarrhythmics), blood pressure (antihypertensives), or 
heart beat (such as calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers medicines that may slow your 
heart rate).</p>
<p>medicines that affect your immune system, due to a possible additive effect on the immune 
system.
Vaccines and Ponvory
Tell your doctor if you have recently received any vaccinations or if you are planning to receive a 
vaccination. You should avoid receiving live vaccines during treatment with Ponvory. If you receive a 
live vaccine, you may get the infection the vaccine was meant to prevent. Ponvory should be stopped 
1 week before and for 4 weeks after receiving a live vaccine. Also, other vaccines may not work as 
well when given during treatment with Ponvory.
Pregnancy, contraception, and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy</p>
<p>Do not use Ponvory during pregnancy. If Ponvory is used during pregnancy there is a risk of 
harm to your unborn baby.</p>
<p>Do not use if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman who could become 
pregnant and you are not using effective contraception.
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females
If you are a woman of childbearing potential:</p>
<p>Your doctor will inform you about the risk of harm to your unborn baby before you start 
treatment with Ponvory and you should have a pregnancy test to check that you are not 
pregnant.</p>
<p>You must use effective contraception while taking Ponvory and for 1 week after you stop taking 
it.
Talk to your doctor about reliable methods of contraception.
If you do become pregnant while taking Ponvory, stop taking Ponvory and tell your doctor straight 
away.
If you become pregnant within 1 week after you stop taking Ponvory, talk to your doctor.
Breast-feeding
You should not breast-feed while you are taking Ponvory. This is to avoid a risk of side effects for the 
baby since Ponvory may pass into breast milk.
Driving and using machines
Ponvory is not expected to have an influence on your ability to drive and use machines.
Ponvory contains lactose
Ponvory contains lactose which is a type of sugar. If you have been told by your doctor that you have 
an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.
Ponvory contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""
