symptoms go away, POTELIGEO can normally continue to be given, but more slowly. Your 
doctor may stop POTELIGEO treatment if your reaction is severe.  </li>

difficulty swallowing, cough, shortness of breath, stomach pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea

<p>skin rash (which may become severe), or sore mouth. In some people receiving POTELIGEO 
for other types of cancers, skin pain/burning sensation, itching, skin blisters/peeling, ulcers in
