Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Pradaxa. You may also need to talk to your doctor during treatment 
with this medicine if you experience symptoms or if you have to undergo surgery.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had any medical conditions or illnesses, in particular any of 
those included in the following list:
-
if you have an increased bleeding risk, such as:</p>
<p>if you have been recently bleeding.</p>
<p>if you have had a surgical tissue removal (biopsy) in the past month.</p>
<p>if you have had a serious injury (e.g. a bone fracture, head injury or any injury requiring 
surgical treatment).</p>
<p>if you are suffering from an inflammation of the gullet or stomach.</p>
<p>if you have problems with reflux of gastric juice into the gullet.</p>
<p>if you are receiving medicines which could increase the risk of bleeding. See  Other 
medicines and Pradaxa  below.</p>
<p>if you are taking anti-inflammatory medicines such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam.</p>
<p>if you are suffering from an infection of the heart (bacterial endocarditis).</p>
<p>if you know you have decreased kidney function, or you are suffering from dehydration 
(symptoms include feeling thirsty and passing reduced amounts of dark-coloured 
(concentrated) / foaming urine).</p>
<p>if you are older than 75 years.</p>
<p>if you are an adult patient and weigh 50 kg or less.</p>
<h2>only if used for children: if the child has an infection around or within the brain.</h2>
<p>if you have had a heart attack or if you have been diagnosed with conditions that increase the 
risk to develop a heart attack.
-
if you have a liver disease that is associated with changes in the blood tests. The use of this 
medicine is not recommended in this case.
Take special care with Pradaxa
-
if you need to have an operation:
In this case Pradaxa will need to be stopped temporarily due to an increased bleeding risk 
during and shortly after an operation. It is very important to take Pradaxa before and after the 
operation exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor.
-
if an operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or 
spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction):</p>
<p>it is very important to take Pradaxa before and after the operation exactly at the times you 
have been told by your doctor.</p>
<p>tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems 
with your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary.
-
if you fall or injure yourself during treatment, especially if you hit your head. Please seek urgent 
medical attention. You may need to be checked by a doctor, as you may be at increased risk of 
bleeding.
-
if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed.

capsules whole. Pradaxa coated granules are available for the treatment of children below 12 years as 
soon as they are able to swallow soft food.
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.
Take Pradaxa as recommended for the following conditions:
Prevention of blood clot formation after knee or hip replacement surgery
The recommended dose is 220 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg).
If your kidney function is decreased by more than half or if you are 75 years of age or older, the 
recommended dose is 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg).
If you are taking amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil containing medicines the recommended dose 
is 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg).
If you are taking verapamil containing medicines and your kidney function is decreased by more 
than half, you should be treated with a reduced dose of 75 mg Pradaxa because your bleeding risk may 
be increased.
For both surgery types, treatment should not be started if there is bleeding from the site of operation. If 
the treatment cannot be started until the day after surgery, dosing should be started with 2 capsules 
once a day.
After knee replacement surgery
You should start treatment with Pradaxa within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, taking a single 
capsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 10 days.
After hip replacement surgery
You should start treatment with Pradaxa within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, taking a single 
capsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 28-35 days.
Treatment of blood clots and prevention of blood clots from reoccurring in children
Pradaxa should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in the evening, at 
approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 12 hours as possible.
The recommended dose depends on weight and age. Your doctor will determine the correct dose. Your 
doctor may adjust the dose as treatment progresses. Keep using all other medicines, unless your doctor 
tells you to stop using any.

How to take Pradaxa
Pradaxa can be taken with or without food. The capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of 
water, to ensure delivery to the stomach. Do not break, chew, or empty the pellets from the capsule 
since this may increase the risk of bleeding.

Tear off one individual blister from the blister card along the perforated line
Peel off the backing foil and remove the capsule.</p>
<p>Do not push the capsules through the blister foil.</p>
<p>Do not peel off the blister foil until a capsule is required.
Instructions for the bottle</p>
<p>Push and turn for opening.</p>
<p>After removing the capsule, place the cap back on the bottle and tightly close the bottle right 
away after you take your dose.
Change of anticoagulant treatment
Without specific guidance from your doctor do not change your anticoagulant treatment.
If you take more Pradaxa than you should
Taking too much of this medicine increases the risk of bleeding. Contact your doctor immediately if 
you have taken too many capsules. Specific treatment options are available.
If you forget to take Pradaxa
Prevention of blood clot formation after knee or hip replacement surgery
Continue with your remaining daily doses of Pradaxa at the same time of the next day.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
Treatment of blood clots and prevention of blood clots from reoccurring in children
A forgotten dose can still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next due dose.
A missed dose should be omitted if the remaining time is below 6 hours prior to the next due dose.
Do not double a dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Pradaxa
Take Pradaxa exactly as prescribed. Do not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor 
first, because the risk of developing a blood clot could be higher if you stop treatment too early. 
Contact your doctor if you experience indigestion after taking Pradaxa.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

Major or severe bleeding may occur, these constitute the most serious side effects and, regardless of 
location, may become disabling, life-threatening or even lead to death. In some cases these bleedings 
may not be obvious.
If you experience any bleeding event that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of 
excessive bleeding (exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained 
swelling) consult your doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to keep you under closer 
observation or change your medicine.
