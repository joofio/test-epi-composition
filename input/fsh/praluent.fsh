Praluent helps lower your levels of  bad  cholesterol (also called  LDL cholesterol ). Praluent blocks a 
protein called PCSK9. * PCSK9 is a protein secreted by liver cells. 
*  Bad  cholesterol is normally removed from your blood by binding to specific  receptors  (docking 
stations) in your liver.<br />
<em> PCSK9 lowers the number of these receptors in the liver   this causes your  bad  cholesterol to be 
higher than it should.<br />
</em> By blocking PCSK9, Praluent increases the number of receptors available to help remove the  bad<br />
cholesterol   this lowers your  bad  cholesterol levels. </p>
<p>What Praluent is used for 
* Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood (hypercholesterolaemia [heterozygous familial and 
non-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia) and children and adolescents 8 years of age and older with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH).<br />
* Adults with high cholesterol levels in their blood and with cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk.  </p>
<p>It is given:</p>
<ul>
<li>together with a statin (a commonly used medicine that treats high cholesterol) or other cholesterol 
lowering medicines, if the maximum dose of a statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently 
or, </li>
<li>alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medicines when statins are not tolerated or cannot 
be used. </li>
</ul>
<p>Continue to follow your cholesterol-lowering diet while taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
