<p>Warnings and precautions: 
Talk to your doctor before taking Pramipexole Accord. Tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop 
any medical conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following: 
* Kidney disease. 
* Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are 
visual. 
* Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced 
Parkinson s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up-
titration of Pramipexole Accord. 
* Dystonia 
* Inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia). In particular, you 
may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), forward bending 
of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back (also called 
pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to change your 
medication. 
* Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep. 
* Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia). 
* Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with 
Pramipexole Accord. 
* Severe heart or blood vessels disease. You will need to have your blood pressure checked 
regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall 
in blood pressure on standing up). 
* Augmentation. You may experience that symptoms start earlier than usual, be more intense and 
involve other limbs. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to 
behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry 
out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders 
and can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally 
high sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need 
to adjust or stop your dose. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling 
elated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion or loss of reality). Your doctor 
may need to adjust or stop your dose. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or 
pain after stopping or reducing your Pramipexole Accord treatment. If the problems persist more than 
a few weeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Pramipexole Accord is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pramipexole Accord 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have 
obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>You should avoid taking Pramipexole Accord together with antipsychotic medicines. </p>
<p>Take care if you are taking the following medicines: 
* cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers) 
* amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson s disease) 
* mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia) 
* zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a 
disease of the human immune system) 
* cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers) 
* quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the 
treatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria)) 
* procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat) 
If you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start 
treatment with Pramipexole Accord. </p>
<p>Take care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are 
drinking alcohol. In these cases Pramipexole Accord may affect your ability to drive and operate 
machinery. </p>
<p>Pramipexole Accord with food, drink and alcohol 
You should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with Pramipexole Accord. 
Pramipexole Accord can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with you if you 
should continue to take Pramipexole Accord. </p>
<p>The effect of Pramipexole Accord on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take 
Pramipexole Accord if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so. </p>
<p>Pramipexole Accord should not be used during breast-feeding. Pramipexole Accord can reduce the 
production of breast milk. Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of 
Pramipexole Accord is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be stopped. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Pramipexole Accord can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If 
affected, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Pramipexole Accord has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, 
particularly in patients with Parkinson s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not 
drive or operate machinery. You should tell your doctor if this occurs. </p>         </div>"""

you will have to take the tablets only once or twice a day. If you have moderate kidney disease, the 
usual starting dose is 1 Pramipexole Accord tablet 0.088 mg twice a day. In severe kidney disease, the 
usual starting dose is just 1 Pramipexole Accord tablet 0.088 mg a day. </p>
<p>If you take more Pramipexole Accord than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, 
* Contact your doctor or nearest hospital casualty department immediately for advice. 
* You may experience vomiting, restlessness, or any of the side effects as described in chapter 4 
 Possible side effects . </p>
<p>If you forget to take Pramipexole Accord 
Do not worry. Simply leave out that dose completely and then take your next dose at the right time. 
Do not try to make up for the missed dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Pramipexole Accord 
Do not stop taking Pramipexole Accord without first talking to your doctor. If you have to stop taking 
this medicine, your doctor will reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of worsening 
symptoms. </p>
<p>If you suffer from Parkinson s disease you should not stop treatment with Pramipexole Accord 
abruptly. A sudden stop could cause you to develop a medical condition called neuroleptic malignant 
syndrome which may represent a major health risk. The symptoms include: 
* akinesia (loss of muscle movement) 
* rigid muscles 
* fever 
* unstable blood pressure 
* tachycardia (increased heart rate) 
* confusion 
* depressed level of consciousness (e.g. coma) </p>
