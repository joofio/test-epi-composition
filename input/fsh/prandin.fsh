more insulin and thereby lower your blood sugar (glucose). </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the 
sugar in your blood or where your body does not respond normally to the insulin it produces. </p>
<p>Prandin is used to control type 2 diabetes in adults as an add-on to diet and exercise: treatment is 
usually started if diet, exercise and weight reduction alone have not been able to control (or lower) 
your blood sugar. Prandin can also be given with metformin, another medicine for diabetes. </p>
<p>Prandin has been shown to lower the blood sugar, which helps to prevent complications from your 
diabetes. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to repaglinide or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>If you have type 1 diabetes. </li>
<li>If the acid level in your blood is raised (diabetic ketoacidosis). </li>
<li>If you have a severe liver disease. </li>
<li>If you take gemfibrozil (a medicine used to lower increased fat levels in the blood). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Prandin: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have liver problems. Prandin is not recommended in patients with moderate liver 
disease. Prandin should not be taken if you have a severe liver disease (see Do not take 
Prandin). </li>
<li>If you have kidney problems. Prandin should be taken with caution. </li>
<li>If you are about to have major surgery or you have recently suffered a severe illness or 
infection. At such times diabetic control may be lost. </li>
<li>If you are under 18 or over 75 years of age. Prandin is not recommended. It has not been 
studied in these age groups. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor if any of the above applies to you. Prandin may not be suitable for you. Your 
doctor will advise you. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not take this medicine if you are under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>If you get a hypo (low blood sugar) </p>
<p>You may get a hypo (short for hypoglycaemia) if your blood sugar gets too low. This may happen: 
* If you take too much Prandin 
* If you exercise more than usual 
* If you take other medicines or suffer from liver or kidney problems (see other sections of 2. What you need to know before you take Prandin). </p>
<p>The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include: cold sweat; cool pale skin; 
headache; rapid heart beat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary changes in vision; 
drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling 
confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
If your blood sugar is low or you feel a hypo coming on: eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack 
or drink, then rest. 
When symptoms of hypoglycaemia have disappeared or when blood sugar levels are stabilised 
continue Prandin treatment. 
Tell people you have diabetes and that if you pass out (become unconscious) due to a hypo, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink. It could choke you. 
* If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) 
and even death. 
* If you have a hypo that makes you pass out, or a lot of hypos, talk to your doctor. The amount 
of Prandin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted. </p>
<p>If your blood sugar gets too high </p>
<p>Your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). This may happen: 
* If you take too little Prandin 
* If you have an infection or a fever 
* If you eat more than usual 
* If you exercise less than usual. </p>
<p>The warning signs of too high blood sugar appear gradually. They include: increased urination; 
feeling thirsty; dry skin and dry mouth. Talk to your doctor. The amount of Prandin, food or exercise 
may need to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Prandin </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
You can take Prandin with metformin, another medicine for diabetes, if your doctor prescribes it. 
If you take gemfibrozil (used to lower increased fat levels in the blood) you should not take Prandin. </p>
<p>Your body’s response to Prandin may change if you take other medicines, especially these: 
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression) 
* Beta blockers (used to treat high blood pressure or heart conditions) 
* ACE-inhibitors (used to treat heart conditions) 
* Salicylates (e.g. aspirin)

<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>

<p>You should not take Prandin if you are breast-feeding. </p>
