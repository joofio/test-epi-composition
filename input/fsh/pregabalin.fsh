  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Pregabalin Zentiva belongs to a group of medicines used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain 
and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. </p>
<p>Peripheral and central neuropathic pain 
Pregabalin Zentiva is used to treat long lasting pain caused by damage to the nerves. A variety 
of diseases can cause peripheral neuropathic pain, such as diabetes or shingles. Pain sensations may 
be described as hot, burning, throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, aching, tingling, 
numbness, pins and needles. Peripheral and central neuropathic pain may also be associated with 
mood changes, sleep disturbance, fatigue (tiredness), and can have an impact on physical and social 
functioning and overall quality of life. </p>
<p>Epilepsy 
Pregabalin Zentiva is used to treat a certain form of epilepsy (partial seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation) in adults. Your doctor will prescribe Pregabalin Zentiva for you to help treat 
your epilepsy when your current treatment is not controlling your condition. You should take 
Pregabalin Zentiva in addition to your current treatment. Pregabalin Zentiva is not intended to be used 
alone, but should always be used in combination with other anti-epileptic treatment. </p>
<p>Generalised anxiety disorder 
Pregabalin Zentiva is used to treat generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). The symptoms of GAD are 
prolonged excessive anxiety and worry that are difficult to control. GAD can also cause restlessness 
or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued (tired), having difficulty concentrating or mind 
going blank, feeling irritable, having muscle tension or sleep disturbance. This is different 
to the stresses and strains of everyday life. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to pregabalin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pregabalin Zentiva. 
* Some patients taking pregabalin have reported symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction. These 
symptoms include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat, as well as diffuse skin rash. 
Should you experience any of these reactions, you should contact your physician immediately. 
* Serious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have 
been reported in association with pregabalin. Stop using pregabalin and seek medical attention 
immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to these serious skin reactions described 
in section 4. * Pregabalin has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase 
the occurrence of accidental injury (fall) in elderly patients. Therefore, you should be careful 
until you are used to any effect the medicine might have. 
* Pregabalin may cause blurring or loss of vision, or other changes in eyesight, many of which are 
temporary. You should immediately tell your doctor if you experience any changes in your 
vision. 
* Some patients with diabetes who gain weight while taking pregabalin may need an alteration 
in their diabetic medicines. 
* Certain side effects may be more common, such as sleepiness, because patients with spinal cord 
injury may be taking other medicines to treat, for example, pain or spasticity, that have similar 
side effects to pregabalin and the severity of these effects may be increased when taken 
together. 
* There have been reports of heart failure in some patients when taking pregabalin; these patients 
were mostly elderly with cardiovascular conditions. Before taking this medicine you should 
tell your doctor if you have a history of heart disease. 
* There have been reports of kidney failure in some patients when taking pregabalin. If while 
taking Pregabalin Zentiva you notice decreased urination, you should tell your doctor 
as stopping the medicine may improve this. 
* Some patients being treated with anti-epileptics such as pregabalin have had thoughts of 
harming or killing themselves or shown suicidal behaviour. If at any time you have these 
thoughts or show such behaviour, immediately contact your doctor. 
* When pregabalin is taken with other medicines that may cause constipation (such as some types 
of pain medicines) it is possible that gastrointestinal problems may occur (e.g. constipation, 
blocked or paralysed bowel). Tell your doctor if you experience constipation, especially if you 
are prone to this problem. 
* Before taking this medicine, tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been dependent on 
alcohol, prescription medicines or illegal drugs; it may mean you have a greater risk of 
becoming dependent on Pregabalin Zentiva. 
* There have been reports of convulsions when taking pregabalin or shortly after stopping 
pregabalin. If you experience a convulsion, contact your doctor immediately. 
* There have been reports of reduction in brain function (encephalopathy) in some patients taking 
pregabalin when they have other conditions. Tell your doctor if you have a history of any 
serious medical conditions, including liver or kidney disease. 
* There have been reports of breathing difficulties. If you have nervous system disorders, 
respiratory disorders, renal impairment, or you are older than 65, your doctor may prescribe you 
a different dosing regimen. Contact your doctor if you experience trouble breathing or shallow 
breaths. </p>
<p>Dependence 
Some people may become dependent on Pregabalin Zentiva (a need to keep taking the medicine). 
They may have withdrawal effects when they stop using Pregabalin Zentiva (see section 3,  How to 
take Pregabalin Zentiva  and  If you stop taking Pregabalin Zentiva ). If you have concerns that you 
may become dependent on Pregabalin Zentiva, it is important that you consult your doctor. </p>
<p>If you notice any of the following signs whilst taking Pregabalin Zentiva, it could be a sign that you 
have become dependent: 
* you need to take the medicine for longer than advised by your prescriber 
* you feel you need to take more than the recommended dose 
* you are using the medicine for reasons other than prescribed 
* you have made repeated, unsuccessful attempts to quit or control the use of the medicine 
* when you stop taking the medicine you feel unwell, and you feel better once taking the 
medicine again 
If you notice any of these, speak to your doctor to discuss the best treatment pathway for you, 
including when it is appropriate to stop and how to do this safely. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) has not been established 
and therefore, pregabalin should not be used in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pregabalin Zentiva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregabalin Zentiva and certain other medicines may influence each other (interaction). When taken 
with certain other medicines, which have sedative effects (including opioids), pregabalin may 
potentiate these effects, and could lead to respiratory failure, coma and death. The degree of dizziness, 
sleepiness and decreased concentration may be increased if pregabalin is taken together with 
medicines containing: 
* oxycodone (used as a pain-killer) 
* lorazepam (used for treating anxiety) 
* alcohol 
Pregabalin Zentiva may be taken with oral contraceptives. </p>
<p>Pregabalin Zentiva with food, drink and alcohol 
Pregabalin Zentiva hard capsules may be taken with or without food. 
It is advised not to drink alcohol while taking Pregabalin Zentiva. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregabalin Zentiva should not be taken during pregnancy or when breast-feeding, unless you are told 
otherwise by your doctor. Pregabalin use during the first 3 months of pregnancy may cause birth 
defects in the unborn child that require medical treatment. In a study reviewing data from women in 
Nordic countries who took pregabalin in the first 3 months of pregnancy, 6 babies in every 100 had 
such birth defects. This compares to 4 babies in every 100 born to women not treated with pregabalin 
in the study. Abnormalities of the face (orofacial clefts), the eyes, the nervous system (including the 
brain), kidneys and genitals have been reported. </p>
<p>Effective contraception must be used by women of childbearing potential. If you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Pregabalin may produce dizziness, sleepiness and decreased concentration. You should not drive, 
operate complex machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until you know whether 
this medicine affects your ability to perform these activities. </p>
<p>Pregabalin Zentiva contains lactose monohydrate 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

of Pregabalin Zentiva hard capsules with you. You may feel sleepy, confused, agitated, or restless 
as a result of taking more Pregabalin Zentiva than you should. Fits and unconsciousness (coma) have 
also been reported. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Pregabalin Zentiva 
It is important to take your Pregabalin Zentiva hard capsules regularly at the same time each day. 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for your next dose. 
In that case, just carry on with the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make 
up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Pregabalin Zentiva 
Do not suddenly stop taking Pregabalin Zentiva. If you want to stop taking Pregabalin Zentiva, discuss 
this with  your doctor first. They will tell you how to do this. If your treatment is stopped it should be 
done gradually over a minimum of 1 week. 
After stopping a short or long term treatment with Pregabalin Zentiva, you need to know that you may 
experience certain side effects, so called withdrawal effects. These effects include, trouble sleeping, 
headache, nausea, feeling anxious, diarrhoea, flu-like symptoms, convulsions, nervousness, 
depression, pain, sweating, and dizziness. These effects may occur more commonly or severely if you 
have been taking Pregabalin Zentiva for a longer period of time. If you experience withdrawal effects, 
you should contact your doctor. </p>
