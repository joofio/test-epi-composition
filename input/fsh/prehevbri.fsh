  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>PreHevbri is a vaccine which prevents infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is used in adults to 
protect from all known types of hepatitis B virus.  </p>
<p>PreHevbri may also protect against hepatitis D which can only occur in people who have hepatitis B 
infection. </p>
<p>What is hepatitis B 
- Hepatitis B is an infectious illness of the liver caused by a virus. Hepatitis B virus infection can 
cause serious liver problems such as  cirrhosis  (scarring in the liver) or liver cancer. 
- Some people infected with the hepatitis B virus become carriers, which means that they may not 
feel ill but continue to have the virus in their body and they can still infect other people. 
- The disease spreads by the hepatitis B virus entering the body through contact with an infected 
person s body fluids, such as in the vagina, blood, semen, or spit (saliva). A mother who is a 
carrier of the virus can also pass the virus to her baby at birth. 
- The main signs of the illness include mild signs of flu (such as headache and fever, feeling 
very tired, dark urine, pale stools [faeces], and yellowing of the skin and eyes [jaundice]). 
However, some people with hepatitis B do not look or feel ill. </p>
<p>How PreHevbri works </p>
<p>When a person is given the PreHevbri vaccine, it helps the body s natural defence system 
(immune system) produce specific protection (antibodies) against the hepatitis B virus. </p>
<ul>
<li>PreHevbri contains a substance (called an  adsorbent )  which improves the body s production 
of antibodies and makes the protection last for longer. </li>
<li>A course of three injections of PreHevbri is required to provide full protection against 
hepatitis B. </li>
<li>PreHevbri is not used to treat a person who is already infected with the hepatitis B virus 
including anyone who has previously been infected and who is now a carrier of the virus. </li>
<li>Prehevbri is a  3-antigenic  vaccine, which contains small amounts of the three antigens 
(pre-S1, pre-S2, S) from the  outer coating  of the hepatitis B virus. This  outer coating  is not 
infectious and cannot make you ill. </li>
</ul>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You must NOT receive PreHevbri:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine <br />
(listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include breathing difficulty, swelling, 
light-headedness, fast heartbeat, sweating, and loss of consciousness. </li>
<li>if you have ever previously had a sudden, life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine 
against hepatitis B.  </li>
</ul>
<p>You must not receive PreHevbri if either of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving PreHevbri. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
- Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment is readily 
available in case you should develop a sudden and rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe 
allergic reaction with symptoms such as breathing difficulty, swelling, light-headedness, fast 
heartbeat, sweating, and loss of consciousness) after you have been given the vaccine. This 
reaction may occur when any vaccine is injected, including PreHevbri. Seek urgent medical 
attention if you develop any of these symptoms after you are given the injectionas this could be 
a life-threatening allergic reaction.<br />
- Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. 
- If you are ill with a high fever, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as they may delay the 
vaccination until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a 
problem, but your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will decide if you could still be vaccinated. 
- If you have low blood platelets or any blood-clotting disorders, then bleeding or bruising may 
occur after you are given the injection. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any of 
these conditions.<br />
- PreHevbri may not prevent hepatitis B infection if you already have an unrecognised hepatitis B 
infection at the time of vaccine administration. 
- As with any vaccine, PreHevbri may not protect all people who are vaccinated. 
- PreHevbri does not protect you against other liver infections such as hepatitis A, C, and E. 
- If you are on dialysis for a kidney problem or if you have a weakened immune system your 
doctor may need to do a blood test to check if the vaccination has worked well enough to 
protect you against hepatitis B.  </p>
<p>If you have any concerns or you are not sure about any of the above, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before receiving PreHevbri.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
PreHevbri has not been fully tested in children under 18 years of age, it should not be used in this age 
group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and PreHevbri 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including any other vaccine.  </p>
<p>In addition to PreHevbri, you may be given an injection of hepatitis B 'immuno-globulins'. This will 
give you immediate short-term protection against hepatitis B infection. If this happens your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse will make sure that the two injections are given in different parts of the body. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before being given this vaccine. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether PreHevbri is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded. Discuss with your doctor or nurse whether the risks and benefits of breast-feeding your child 
outweigh the benefit of vaccination and whether you should stop breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
PreHevbri is unlikely to have any effect on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel tired, 
or have a headache or feel dizzy after having the vaccine, do not drive or use any machines until you 
feel well again.  </p>
<p>PreHevbri contain sodium and potassium 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. that is to say is essentially 
'sodium-free . </p>
<p>This vaccine  contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. that is to say is essentially 
 potassium-free . </p>         </div>"""
