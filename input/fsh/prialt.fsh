- if you are allergic to ziconotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you are receiving an anticancer medicine into the space around your spinal cord. 
- if you have a history of suicidal attempt or suicidal ideation with ziconotide </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Patients should undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before, after starting and during intrathecal 
ziconotide, and immediately when any depressive signs or symptoms appear. 
Caregivers should contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of potentially 
life-threatening adverse event. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you are given Prialt 
- The effects of long-term treatment of Prialt are uncertain at this time and the possibility of toxic 
effects on the spinal cord have not yet been ruled out. In case of a need for long term treatment, 
monitoring may be necessary (as decided by your doctor). 
- If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body, it is important you check once 
daily for any signs of infection at the point where the tube enters your body. 
- If you observe any signs of infection around the tube, such as skin redness, swelling, pain or 
discharge, you must tell your doctor immediately and seek treatment for the infection. 
- If you develop any tenderness in the area around the tube without signs of infection, you should 
seek advice from your doctor as soon as possible as tenderness may be an early sign of 
infection. 
- If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body and any part of the infusion 
tubing becomes disconnected, you must contact your doctor or nurse immediately. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have any of the following symptoms: high temperature, headache, stiff neck, tiredness, 
confusion, feeling sick, vomiting or occasional fits, these may be signs of meningitis. You must 
tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. </li>
<li>If you notice any adverse change in your thinking, mood or memory, please tell your doctor. </li>
<li>If you are receiving chemotherapy please tell your doctor. </li>
<li>You may have an increased level of an enzyme called creatine kinase in your blood and 
although this does not usually cause any symptoms or problems, your doctor is likely to monitor 
its level. In addition, you may also occasionally experience muscular problems. If such is the 
case, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may decide to halt your Prialt 
treatment. </li>
<li>You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after 
receiving your treatment; sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, pain in the chest, swelling 
of eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (especially affecting the whole body). These may be signs 
of a severe allergic reaction. </li>
<li>In patients that suffer from severe long term pain, there is a higher likelihood of suicide and 
attempted suicide than in the general population. Prialt may also cause or worsen depression in 
people that are already susceptible. If you are experiencing depression or have a history of 
depression please inform your healthcare professional before you are commenced on Prialt. If 
after starting Prialt you experience a worsening of your depression or have any other symptoms 
affecting your mood, please inform your healthcare professional. </li>
<li>You may experience drowsiness or may not be fully aware of your surroundings whilst 
receiving treatment. If this happens, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may 
decide to halt your Prialt treatment. </li>
</ul>

baclofen used to treat muscle spasticity, clonidine used to treat high blood pressure, bupivacaine used 
for local anaesthesia, morphine used for pain, propofol used for general anaesthesia or any medicine 
which is administered by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord 
and the brain)). You may feel drowsy if you are given Prialt with certain other medicines used to treat 
pain. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>

contraception.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines

before you drive or operate machinery. </p>
<p>Prialt contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum recommended intrathecal dose 
(21.6 micrograms per day), that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

the space around the spinal cord, and in the use of internal and external infusion pumps. </p>
<p>The recommended starting dose is at no more than 2.4 micrograms per day. Your doctor may adjust 
the dose of Prialt very slowly according to the severity of your pain by adding no more than 
2.4 micrograms/day. The maximum dose is 21.6 micrograms/day. At the start of your treatment your 
doctor may increase your dose every 1 to 2 days or more. If needed, the dose may be decreased or 
injection stopped if the side effects are too great. </p>
<p>Prialt is given as a very slow continuous injection into the space surrounding the spinal cord 
(intrathecal use). The medicine will be administered continuously from a pump either implanted into 
your abdominal wall or placed externally in a belt pouch. Your doctor will discuss with you the kind of 
pump that will be most suitable for you and when you need to have your pump refilled. </p>
<p>Pain relief may be achieved through a stepwise process by adjusting the dose of Prialt very slowly. If 
you feel that you are still in too much pain while receiving Prialt, or that the side effects are too great, 
talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Before giving you Prialt, your doctor might decide to slowly stop giving you opiates (other types of 
medicinal product which are used to treat pain) into your spinal cord and instead replace with 
alternative pain medicinal products. </p>
<p>If you receive more Prialt than you should 
If you receive more Prialt than your doctor intended, you may feel unwell with signs such as 
confusion, problems with speech, word finding difficulties, excessive shaking, light-headedness, 
excessive sleepiness, feeling or being sick. If this happens, consult your doctor or hospital 
immediately. </p>
