  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>PritorPlus is a combination of two active substances, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in one 
tablet. Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure.
-
Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow
thus increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the 
blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered.
-
Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics, which cause your 
urine output to increase, leading to a lowering of your blood pressure.
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead 
sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms 
of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure 
to verify if it is within the normal range.
PritorPlus is used to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adults whose blood pressure 
is not controlled enough when telmisartan is used alone. </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or to any other sulfonamide-derived medicines.</p>
<p>if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid PritorPlus in early pregnancy 
  see pregnancy section.)</p>
<p>if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.</p>
<p>if you have severe kidney disease.</p>

If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking PritorPlus.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking PritorPlus if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the 
following conditions or illnesses:
-
Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body 
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (water tablets), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, or haemodialysis.
-
Kidney disease or kidney transplant.
-
Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).
-
Liver disease.
-
Heart trouble.
-
Diabetes.
-
Gout.
-
Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various 
blood minerals).
-
Systemic lupus erythematosus (also called  lupus  or  SLE ) a disease where the body s 
immune system attacks the body.
-
The active ingredient hydrochlorothiazide can cause an unusual reaction, resulting in a decrease 
in vision and eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of 
the eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye and can happen within hours 
to weeks of taking PritorPlus. This can lead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated.
-
If you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. 
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase 
the risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin 
from sun exposure and UV rays while taking PritorPlus.
Talk to your doctor before taking PritorPlus:</p>
<p>if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems.</li>
<li>aliskiren.
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes
(e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading  Do 
not take PritorPlus .</li>
</ul>
<p>if you are taking digoxin.</p>
<p>if you experienced breathing or lung problems (including inflammation or fluid in the lungs) 
following hydrochlorothiazide intake in the past. If you develop any severe shortness of breath 
or difficulty breathing after taking PritorPlus, seek medical attention immediately.
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. PritorPlus is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance in your body. Typical symptoms 
of fluid or electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, 
muscle pain or cramps, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tired muscles, and an abnormally fast heart 
rate (faster than 100 beats per minute). If you experience any of these you should tell your doctor.
You should also tell your doctor, if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with 
symptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than 
normal.
In case of surgery or anaesthetics, you should tell your doctor that you are taking PritorPlus.
PritorPlus may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Children and adolescents
The use of PritorPlus in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.
Other medicines and PritorPlus
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medications or take other 
precautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially 
to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with PritorPlus:
-
Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.
-
Medicines associated with low blood potassium (hypokalaemia) such as other diuretics, ('water 
tablets'), laxatives (e.g. castor oil), corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), ACTH (a hormone), 
amphotericin (an antifungal medicine), carbenoxolone (used to treat mouth ulcers), penicillin G 
sodium (an antibiotic), and salicylic acid and derivatives.
-
Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, ACE inhibitors, cyclosporin (an 
immunosuppressant medicine) and other medicinal products such as heparin sodium (an 
anticoagulant).
-
Medicines that are affected by changes of the blood potassium level such as heart medicines 
(e.g. digoxin) or medicines to control the rhythm of your heart (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, 
amiodarone, sotalol), medicines used for mental disorders (e.g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, 
levomepromazine) and other medicines such as certain antibiotics (e.g. sparfloxacine, 
pentamidine) or certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine).
-
Medicines for the treatment of diabetes (insulins or oral agents such as metformin).
-
Cholestyramine and colestipol, medicines for lowering blood fat levels.
-
Medicines to increase blood pressure, such as noradrenaline.
-
Muscle relaxing medicines, such as tubocurarine.
-
Calcium supplements and/or vitamin D supplements.
-
Anti-cholinergic medicines (medicines used to treat a variety of disorders such as 
gastrointestinal cramps, urinary bladder spasm, asthma, motion sickness, muscular spasms, 
Parkinson's disease and as an aid to anaesthesia) such as atropine and biperiden.
-
Amantadine (medicine used to treat Parkinson s disease and also used to treat or prevent certain 
illnesses caused by viruses).
-
Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, corticosteroids, painkillers (such as non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), medicines to treat cancer, gout, or arthritis.
-
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings  Do not 
take PritorPlus  and  Warnings and precautions ).
-
Digoxin.
PritorPlus may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood 
pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). 
Furthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or 
antidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your 
doctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking PritorPlus.
The effect of PritorPlus may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen).
PritorPlus with food and alcohol
You can take PritorPlus with or without food.
Avoid taking alcohol until you have talked to your doctor. Alcohol may make your blood pressure fall 
more and/or increase the risk of you becoming dizzy or feeling faint.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Pregnancy
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking PritorPlus before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of PritorPlus. PritorPlus is not 
recommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may 
cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. PritorPlus is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for 
you if you wish to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines
Some people feel dizzy or tired when taking PritorPlus. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or 
operate machinery.
PritorPlus contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .
PritorPlus contains milk sugar (lactose) 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
PritorPlus contains sorbitol
This medicine contains 169 mg sorbitol in each tablet.</p>         </div>"""

If you take more PritorPlus than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets you may experience symptoms such as low blood pressure 
and rapid heartbeat. Slow heartbeat, dizziness, vomiting, reduced kidney function including kidney 
failure, have also been reported. Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, markedly low blood 
pressure and low blood levels of potassium can also happen, which may result in nausea, sleepiness 
and muscle cramps and/or irregular heartbeat associated with the concomitant use of medicines such 
as digitalis or certain anti-arrhythmic treatments. Contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest 
hospital emergency department immediately.
If you forget to take PritorPlus
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If 
you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.
