  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Procoralan (ivabradine) is a heart medicine used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symptomatic stable angina pectoris (which causes chest pain) in adult patients whose heart rate is 
over or equal to 70 beats per minute. It is used in adult patients who do not tolerate or cannot take 
heart medicines called beta-blockers. It is also used in combination with beta-blockers in adult 
patients whose condition is not fully controlled with a beta-blocker. </li>
<li>Chronic heart failure in adult patients whose heart rate is over or equal to 75 beats per minute. It is 
used in combination with standard therapy, including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blockers 
are contraindicated or not tolerated. </li>
</ul>
<p>About stable angina pectoris (usually referred to as  angina ): 
Stable angina is a heart disease which happens when the heart does not receive enough oxygen. The 
most common symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort. </p>
<p>About chronic heart failure : 
Chronic heart failure is a heart disease which happens when your heart cannot pump enough blood to 
the rest of your body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, 
tiredness and ankle swelling. </p>
<p>How does Procoralan work? 
The specific heart rate lowering action of ivabradine helps :</p>
<ul>
<li>to control and reduce the number of angina attacks by lowering heart s need for oxygen, </li>
<li>to improve the heart functioning and vital prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. </li>

Procoralan should be taken during meals. 
Procoralan 5 mg tablet can be divided into equal doses. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for stable angina pectoris 
The starting dose should not exceed one tablet of Procoralan 5 mg twice daily. If you still have angina 
symptoms and if you have tolerated the 5 mg twice daily dose well, the dose may be increased. The 
maintenance dose should not exceed 7.5 mg twice daily. Your doctor will prescribe the right dose for 
you. The usual dose is one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening. In some cases (e.g. if 
you are aged 75 years or more), your doctor may prescribe half the dose i.e., one half 5 mg tablet of 
Procoralan 5 mg (corresponding to 2.5 mg ivabradine) in the morning and one half 5 mg tablet in the 
evening. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for chronic heart failure 
The usual recommended starting dose is one tablet of Procoralan 5 mg twice daily increasing if 
necessary to one tablet of Procoralan 7.5 mg twice daily. Your doctor will decide the right dose for 
you. The usual dose is one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening. In some cases (e.g. if 
you are aged 75 years or more), your doctor may prescribe half the dose i.e., one half 5 mg tablet of 
Procoralan 5 mg (corresponding to 2.5 mg ivabradine) in the morning and one half 5 mg tablet in the 
evening. </p>
<p>If you take more Procoralan than you should: 
A large dose of Procoralan could make you feel breathless or tired because your heart slows down too 
much. If this happens, contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Procoralan: 
If you forget to take a dose of Procoralan, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for the forgotten dose. 
The calendar printed on the blister containing the tablets should help you remember when you last 
took a tablet of Procoralan. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Procoralan: 
As the treatment for angina or chronic heart failure is usually life-long, you should discuss with your 
doctor before stopping this medicinal product. 
If you think that the effect of Procoralan is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
