  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>The active substance of Prometax is rivastigmine. </p>
<p>Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with 
Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson’s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, 
resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to 
communicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down 
acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Prometax 
allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of 
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease. </p>
<p>Prometax is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s 
dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and 
behaviour. The capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Prometax 
- if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Prometax) or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
- if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local 
reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve 
within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Prometax. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Prometax: 
- if you have, or have ever had, a heart condition such as an irregular or slow heartbeat, QTc 
prolongation, a family history of QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, or have a low blood level 
of potassium or magnesium. 
- if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. 
- if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. 
- if you have, or have ever had, seizures. 
- if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease. 
- if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function. 
- if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function. 
- if you suffer from trembling. 
- if you have a low body weight. 
- if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and 
diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are 
prolonged. 
If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this 
medicine. </p>
<p>If you have not taken Prometax for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have 
talked to your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is no relevant use of Prometax in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Prometax 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Prometax should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Prometax. 
Prometax might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or 
spasms, to treat Parkinson’s disease or to prevent travel sickness). </p>
<p>Prometax should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or 
prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff 
limbs and trembling hands. </p>
<p>If you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Prometax, tell your doctor before you are given any 
anaesthetics, because Prometax may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during 
anaesthesia. </p>
<p>Caution when Prometax is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat 
hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause 
problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness. </p>
<p>Caution when Prometax is taken together with other medicines that can affect your heart rhythm or the 
electrical system of your heart (QT prolongation). </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Prometax must be assessed against the possible effects on 
your unborn child. Prometax should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed during treatment with Prometax. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Prometax may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing the 
dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your 
attention. </p>         </div>"""

* Your doctor will slowly increase your dose depending on how you respond to treatment.

<p>If you take more Prometax than you should 
If you accidentally take more Prometax than you should, inform your doctor. You may require 
medical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Prometax have experienced 
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow 
heartbeat and fainting may also occur. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Prometax 
If you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Prometax, wait and take the next dose at the usual 
time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
