<p>Protopic 0.03% ointment is used to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults who 
are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical 
corticosteroids and in children (2 years of age and older) who failed to respond adequately to 
conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids.  </p>
<p>Once moderate to severe atopic dermatitis is cleared or almost cleared after up to 6 weeks treatment of 
a flare, and if you are experiencing frequent flares (i.e. 4 or more per year), it may be possible to 
prevent flares coming back or prolong the time you are free from flares by using Protopic 0.03% 
ointment twice weekly. </p>
<p>In atopic dermatitis, an over-reaction of the skin’s immune system causes skin inflammation 
(itchiness, redness, dryness). Protopic alters the abnormal immune response and relieves the skin 
inflammation and the itch. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Protopic: 
* If you have liver failure. 
* If you have any skin malignancies (tumours) or if you have a weakened immune system 
(immuno-compromised) whatever the cause. 
* If you have an inherited skin barrier disease such as Netherton’s syndrome, lamellar 
ichthyosis (extensive scaling of the skin due to a thickening of the outer layer of the skin), or if 
you have an inflammatory skin disease such as pyoderma gangrenosum, or if you suffer from 
generalised erythroderma (inflammatory reddening and scaling of the entire skin). 
* If you have a cutaneous Graft Versus Host Disease (an immune reaction of the skin which is a 
common complication in patients who have undergone a bone marrow transplant). 
* If you have swollen lymph nodes at initiation of treatment. If your lymph nodes become 
swollen during treatment with Protopic, consult your doctor. 
* If you have infected lesions. Do not apply the ointment to infected lesions. 
* If you notice any change to the appearance of your skin, please inform your physician.<br />
<em> Based on the results of long-term studies and experience, a link between Protopic ointment 
treatment and the development of malignancies has not been confirmed, but definitive 
conclusions cannot be drawn. <br />
</em> Avoid exposing the skin to long periods of sunlight or artificial sunlight such as tanning beds. If 
you spend time outdoors after applying Protopic, use a sunscreen and wear loose fitting clothing 
that protects the skin from the sun. In addition, ask your doctor for advice on other appropriate 
sun protection methods. If you are prescribed light therapy, inform your doctor that you are 
using Protopic as it is not recommended to use Protopic and light therapy at the same time. 
* If your doctor tells you to use Protopic twice weekly to keep your atopic dermatitis cleared, 
your condition should be reviewed by your doctor at least every 12 months, even if it remains 
under control. In children, maintenance treatment should be suspended after 12 months, to 
assess whether the need for continued treatment still exists. 
* It is recommended to use Protopic ointment at the lowest possible strength, at the lowest 
frequency and for the shortest possible duration necessary. This decision should be based on 
your doctor’s assessment of how your eczema responds to Protopic ointment. </p>
<p>Children 
* Protopic ointment is not approved for children younger than 2 years of age. Therefore it 
should not be used in this age group. Please consult your doctor. 
* The effect of treatment with Protopic on the developing immune system in children, especially 
the young, has not been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines, cosmetics and Protopic 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>You may use moisturising creams and lotions during treatment with Protopic but these products 
should not be used within two hours of applying Protopic. </p>
<p>The use of Protopic at the same time as other preparations to be used on the skin or while taking oral 
corticosteroids (e.g. cortisone) or medicines which affect the immune system has not been studied. </p>
<p>Protopic with alcohol 
While using Protopic, drinking alcohol may cause the skin or face to become flushed or red and feel 
hot. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Protopic contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321) 
Protopic contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321), which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact 
dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. </p>         </div>"""

you are not sure.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Apply Protopic as a thin layer to affected areas of your skin. </li>
<li>Protopic may be used on most parts of the body, including the face and neck and in the creases 
of your elbows and knees. </li>
<li>Avoid using the ointment inside your nose or mouth or in your eyes. If the ointment gets on any 
of these areas, it should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water. </li>
<li>Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages or wraps. </li>
<li>Wash your hands after applying Protopic unless your hands are also being treated. </li>
<li>Before applying Protopic after a bath or shower, be sure your skin is completely dry. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children (2 years of age and older) 
Apply Protopic 0.03 % ointment twice a day for up to three weeks, once in the morning and once in 
the evening. Afterwards the ointment should be used once a day on each affected region of the skin 
until the eczema has gone away. </p>
<p>Adults (16 years of age and older) 
Two strengths of Protopic (Protopic 0.03% and Protopic 0.1% ointment) are available for adult 
patients (16 years of age and older). Your doctor will decide which strength is best for you.  </p>
<p>Usually, treatment is started with Protopic 0.1% ointment twice a day, once in the morning and once in 
the evening, until the eczema has cleared. Depending on the response of your eczema your doctor will 
decide if the frequency of application can be reduced or the lower strength, Protopic 0.03% ointment, 
can be used. </p>
<p>Treat each affected region of your skin until the eczema has gone away. Improvement is usually seen 
within one week. If you do not see any improvement after two weeks, see your doctor about other 
possible treatments.  </p>
<p>You may be told by your doctor to use Protopic ointment twice weekly once your atopic dermatitis has 
cleared or almost cleared (Protopic 0.03% for children and Protopic 0.1% for adults). Protopic 
ointment should be applied once a day twice weekly (e.g. Monday and Thursday) to areas of your 
body commonly affected by atopic dermatitis. There should be 2–3 days without Protopic treatment 
between applications. 
If symptoms reappear you should use Protopic twice daily as outlined above and arrange to see your 
doctor to review your treatment. </p>
<p>If you accidentally swallow some ointment 
If you accidentally swallow the ointment, consult your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Do 
not try to induce vomiting. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Protopic 
If you forget to apply the ointment at the scheduled time, do it as soon as you remember and then 
continue as before. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
