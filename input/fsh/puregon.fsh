<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Puregon if you: 
* have had an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics (neomycin and/or streptomycin) 
* have uncontrolled pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems 
* have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) 
* have adrenal glands that are not working properly (adrenocortical insufficiency) 
* have high prolactin levels in the blood (hyperprolactinemia) 
* have any other medical conditions (for example, diabetes, heart disease, or any other long-term 
disease). </p>
<p>If you are a woman: </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
Your doctor will check the effects of the treatment regularly to be able to choose the correct dose of 
Puregon from day to day. You may regularly have ultrasound scans of the ovaries. Your doctor may 
also check blood hormone levels. This is very important since too high a dose of FSH may lead to rare 
but serious complications in which the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing follicles become 
larger than normal. This serious medical condition is called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
(OHSS). In rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. OHSS causes fluid to build-up suddenly 
in your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to form. Call your doctor right away if you 
notice severe abdominal swelling, pain in the stomach area (abdomen), feeling sick (nausea), 
vomiting, sudden weight gain due to fluid build-up, diarrhoea, decreased urine output or trouble 
breathing (see also section 4 on Possible side effects). 
  Regular monitoring of the response to FSH-treatment helps to prevent ovarian overstimulation. 
Contact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains, also if this occurs some days 
after the last injection has been given. </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy or birth defects 
After treatment with gonadotrophin preparations, there is an increased chance of having multiple 
pregnancies, even when only one embryo is transferred into the uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry an 
increased health risk for both the mother and her babies around the time of birth. Furthermore, 
multiple pregnancies and characteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment (e.g. age of the 
female, sperm characteristics, genetic background of both parents) may be associated with an 
increased risk of birth defects.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy complications 
There is a slightly increased risk of a pregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy). Therefore, 
your doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to exclude the possibility of pregnancy 
outside the uterus. 
In women undergoing fertility treatment there may be a slightly higher chance of a miscarriage. </p>
<p>Blood clot (Thrombosis) 
Treatment with Puregon, just as pregnancy itself, may increase the risk of having a blood clot 
(thrombosis). Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. </p>
<p>Blood clots can lead to serious medical conditions, such as:<br />
* blockage in your lungs (pulmonary embolus) 
* stroke 
* heart attack 
* blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis) 
* a lack of blood flow (deep venous thrombosis) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg. </p>
<p>Please discuss this with your doctor, before starting treatment, especially: 
* if you already know you have an increased chance of having thrombosis 
* if you, or anyone in your immediate family, have ever had a thrombosis 
* if you are severely overweight. </p>
<p>Ovarian torsion 
Ovarian torsion has occurred after treatment with gonadotropins including Puregon. Ovarian torsion is 
the twisting of an ovary. Twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the ovary to be cut off.  </p>
<p>Before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
* have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome OHSS 
* are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant 
* have ever had stomach (abdominal) surgery 
* have ever had a twisting of an ovary 
* have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries. </p>
<p>Ovarian and other reproductive system tumours 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had 
infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these 
tumours in infertile women. </p>
<p>Other medical conditions 
In addition, before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you: 
* have been told by a doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you.  </p>
<p>If you are a man: </p>
<p>Men with too much FSH in their blood 
Increased FSH blood levels are a sign of damage to the testicles. Puregon is usually not effective in 
such cases. To check the effects of treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen sample to be 
analysed, four to six months after the start of treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
There is no relevant use of Puregon in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Puregon  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If Puregon is used in a combination with clomifene citrate, the effect of Puregon may be increased. If a 
GnRH agonist (a medicine used to prevent early ovulation) has been given, higher doses of Puregon 
may be needed. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. You should not use Puregon if 
you are already pregnant, or think you might be pregnant. </p>
<p>Puregon may affect milk production. It is unlikely that Puregon is passed into breast milk. If you are 
breast-feeding, tell your doctor before using Puregon.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Puregon is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Puregon contains benzyl alcohol </p>
<p>This medicinal product contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL.<br />
Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.<br />
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large 
amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called  metabolic 
acidosis ). 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. This is because large 
amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called  metabolic 
acidosis ). </p>
<p>Puregon contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dosage in women </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide on your starting dose. This dose may be adjusted during your treatment 
period. Further details on the treatment schedule are given below.<br />
There are large differences between women in the response of the ovaries to FSH, which makes it 
impossible to set a dosage schedule which is suitable for all patients. To find the right dosage, your 
doctor will check your follicle growth by means of ultrasound scanning, and measurement of the 
amount of oestradiol (female sex hormone) in the blood. 
* 
Women who are not ovulating 
A starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least seven days. If there is no 
ovarian response, the daily dose will then be gradually increased until follicle growth and/or 
plasma oestradiol levels indicate a proper response. The daily dose is then maintained until a 
follicle of proper size is present. Usually, 7 to 14 days of treatment are sufficient. Puregon 
treatment is then stopped and ovulation will be induced by giving human chorionic 
gonadotrophin (hCG).<br />
* 
Medically assisted reproduction programs, for instance IVF 
A starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least the first four days. After 
this, your dose may be adjusted, based upon your ovarian response. When a sufficient number of 
follicles of proper size are present, the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by 
giving hCG. Retrieval of the egg(s) is performed 34-35 hours later.  </p>
<p>Dosage in men </p>
<p>Puregon is usually prescribed at a dose of 450 IU per week, mostly in 3 dosages of 150 IU, in 
combination with another hormone (hCG), for at least 3 to 4 months. The treatment period equals the 
development time of sperm and the time in which improvement can be expected. If your sperm 
production has not started after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.  </p>
<p>How are the injections given </p>
<p>Puregon solution for injection in cartridges has been developed for use in the Puregon Pen. The 
separate instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully. Do not use the cartridge if the 
solution contains particles or if the solution is not clear.<br />
Using the pen, injections just under the skin (in the lower stomach, for example) can be given by 
yourself or your partner. Your doctor will tell you when and how to do this. If you inject yourself with 
Puregon, follow the instructions carefully to give Puregon properly and with minimal discomfort.<br />
The very first injection of Puregon should only be given in the presence of a doctor or nurse.<br />
A small amount of the medicine may remain in the cartridge after the treatment with Puregon is 
completed even when all doses have been correctly given. Do not try to use any remaining medicine. 
After administration of the last dose, the cartridge must be properly discarded. </p>
<p>If you use more Puregon than you should </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately. 
Too high a dose of Puregon may cause hyperstimulation of the ovaries (OHSS). This may be noticed 
as pain in the stomach. If you are troubled by stomach pains, tell your doctor immediately. See also 
section 4 on possible side effects.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Puregon  </p>
<p>If you forget a dose do not use a double dose to make up for a missed dose.<br />
  Contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Serious side effects in women<br />
A complication with FSH treatment is hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Ovarian overstimulation may 
develop into a medical condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be 
a serious medical problem. The risk can be reduced by careful monitoring of follicular development 
during treatment. Your doctor will do ultrasound scans of your ovaries to carefully monitor the 
number of maturing follicles. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. Pain in the stomach, 
feeling sick or diarrhoea are the first symptoms. In more severe cases symptoms may include 
enlargement of the ovaries, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and/or chest (which may cause 
sudden weight gain due to fluid buildup) and the occurrence of blood clots in the circulation. See 
warnings and precautions in section 2.   Contact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains, or any of the other 
symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation, also if this occurs some days after the last injection. </p>
