  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Pylobactell is a breath test for determining the presence of the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. 
pylori) in the gut (stomach and adjacent bowel) which may be the reason for your stomach (gastric) 
condition.  </p>
<p>Your doctor has recommended that you have a 13C-Urea breath test, for one of the following reasons: 
 
Your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from H. pylori infection to help diagnose 
your condition. 
 
You have already been diagnosed with H. pylori and have been taking medication aimed to clear 
up the infection. Your doctor now wants to find out if the treatment has worked. </p>
<p>This medicine is for diagnostic use only. </p>
<p>How does the test work? 
All foods contain a substance called carbon 13 (13C), in varying amounts. This 13C can be detected in 
the carbon dioxide that you breathe out of your lungs. The actual amount of 13C in the breath will 
depend on the type of food that you have eaten. </p>
<p>You will be asked to drink a "test meal". This will help keep the test 13C-urea solution in your 
stomach. </p>
<p>Following the meal, 3 samples of your breath will be taken. These samples will be analysed to 
measure the normal amount of 13C in the carbon dioxide in your breath. </p>
<p>You will then drink the Pylobactell 13C-urea solution. If H. pylori is present and active in your 
stomach, these bacteria will break down the 13C-urea and this is detected in the carbon dioxide in your 
breath. 
A further 3 samples of your breath will then be taken 30 minutes later. </p>
<p>The amount of 13C in these samples will be compared to your normal level. If there is a significant 
increase in the amount of 13C, this will let your doctor know that active H. pylori is present.  </p>         </div>"""

- are allergic to 13C-urea or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in Section 6). 
- suffer from any medical condition that you think may affect, or be affected by, the test.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pylobactell if: 
 
part of your stomach has been removed (partial gastrectomy) as the reliability of the test has 
not been proven in these patients 
 
you have or suspect you have a gastric infection 
 
you have long term stomach problems (atrophic gastritis) as the breath test may give the 
wrong result and other tests may be required to confirm the presence of H. pylori. 
 
fasting (not taking food) may have medical implications for you 
 
you are under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pylobactell 
Please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Do not take the test if: </p>
<p> 
You have taken antibiotics or medication to treat Helicobacter pylori within the last 28 days </p>
<p> 
You have taken proton pump inhibitors in the last 14 days </p>
<p> 
You have taken H2 antagonists or antacids on the same day of the test. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking medication without the advice of your doctor. </p>
<p>Taking Pylobactell with food and drink 
You should fast for at least 4 hours before the test so that the test is taken on an empty stomach. If you 
have eaten a heavy meal it will be necessary to fast for six hours before the test. 
You can drink water during the fasting period. 
If fasting is a problem e.g. for diabetic patients, please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pylobactell can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This test should not affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""
