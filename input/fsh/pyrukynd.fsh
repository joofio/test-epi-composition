<p>Pyrukynd is used to treat adults with an inherited condition called pyruvate kinase deficiency. Patients 
with pyruvate kinase deficiency have changes to an enzyme in their red blood cells called pyruvate 
kinase, which result in it not working properly. This leads to the red blood cells being broken down 
too fast, a process known as haemolytic anaemia. </p>
<p>Pyrukynd helps the pyruvate kinase enzyme to work better. It increases the energy in your red blood 
cells and stops them from being broken down too fast. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions about how Pyrukynd works or why 
this medicine has been prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""

medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. In particular: </p>

<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with Pyrukynd. 
* This is because it may cause harm to your unborn baby. 
* Talk to your doctor straight away if you become pregnant while taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you plan to breast feed, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is 
because it is not known whether the medicine passes into human breast milk or what the effects might 
be on the baby. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>While taking Pyrukynd, there may be an impact on the ability of a woman and a man to conceive. Talk 
to your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are planning to have a child. </p>
<p>Contraception for women </p>
<p>If you could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception while taking Pyrukynd. You must 
also do this for at least 1 month after taking your last dose. 
While you are taking Pyrukynd, some birth control medicines containing hormones (such as pills) may 
not work as well as expected, meaning you might be at risk of becoming pregnant. Talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse about contraception methods that may be right for you while you are using 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You may experience difficulty sleeping (insomnia) during treatment with Pyrukynd. If this happens to 
you, be careful when driving or using machines. </p>

<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>

free . </p>         </div>"""
