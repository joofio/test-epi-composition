<p>Pyrukynd is used to treat adults with an inherited condition called pyruvate kinase deficiency. Patients 
with pyruvate kinase deficiency have changes to an enzyme in their red blood cells called pyruvate 
kinase, which result in it not working properly. This leads to the red blood cells being broken down 
too fast, a process known as haemolytic anaemia. </p>
<p>Pyrukynd helps the pyruvate kinase enzyme to work better. It increases the energy in your red blood 
cells and stops them from being broken down too fast. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions about how Pyrukynd works or why 
this medicine has been prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Pyrukynd. </p>
<p>It is important that you do not stop taking this medicine suddenly because this may lead to worsening 
of your anaemia, with sudden breakdown of red blood cells (acute haemolysis). </p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to stop taking Pyrukynd, talk to your doctor first. </li>
<li>Your doctor will tell you how to stop taking this medicine – usually by reducing the dose 
gradually. This is to prevent any side effects caused by sudden breakdown of the red blood 
cells. </li>
</ul>
<p>See section 4 below for more information about these side effects. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known if mitapivat is safe and effective for them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Pyrukynd </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. In particular: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines because they may increase 
the risk of side effects of Pyrukynd (such as not sleeping) or they may stop Pyrukynd from working 
properly: 
* certain medicines for fungal infections - such as itraconazole<br />
* certain medicines for tuberculosis - such as rifampicin 
* certain medicines for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux - such as famotidine </p>

* certain birth control (contraceptive) medicines containing hormones - such as ethinylestradiol 
* certain chemotherapy medicines for cancer treatment - such as irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, 
paclitaxel

* certain medicines for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux - such as omeprazole 
* certain medicines for type 2 diabetes - such as repaglinide 
* certain blood thinners - such as warfarin, dabigatran etexilate 
* certain medicines for heart problems - such as digoxin 
* certain medicines to treat epilepsy - such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid<br />
* certain medicines used for strong pain relief - such as alfentanil

<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with Pyrukynd. 
* This is because it may cause harm to your unborn baby. 
* Talk to your doctor straight away if you become pregnant while taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you plan to breast feed, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is 
because it is not known whether the medicine passes into human breast milk or what the effects might 
be on the baby. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>While taking Pyrukynd, there may be an impact on the ability of a woman and a man to conceive. Talk 
to your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are planning to have a child. </p>
<p>Contraception for women </p>
<p>If you could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception while taking Pyrukynd. You must 
also do this for at least 1 month after taking your last dose. 
While you are taking Pyrukynd, some birth control medicines containing hormones (such as pills) may 
not work as well as expected, meaning you might be at risk of becoming pregnant. Talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse about contraception methods that may be right for you while you are using 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You may experience difficulty sleeping (insomnia) during treatment with Pyrukynd. If this happens to 
you, be careful when driving or using machines. </p>
<p>Pyrukynd contains lactose and sodium </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""

day.
