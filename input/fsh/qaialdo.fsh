  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Qaialdo contains the active substance spironolactone. Spironolactone belongs to a group of medicines 
called ‘diuretics’ (water tablets). Spironolactone works by blocking the effects of aldosterone, a 
hormone that helps control water balance in the body. Spironolactone causes you to excrete excess salt 
and water and keeps your potassium levels from getting too low. This reduces oedema. Spironolactone 
is used to treat various conditions in newborns, children and adults. </p>
<p>Qaialdo is used to treat refractory oedema (persistent swelling due to the build-up of fluid that has not 
responded to other treatment) associated with: </p>
<ul>
<li>congestive heart failure (when the heart does not pump blood as well as it should with build-up 
of fluid around the heart causing shortness of breath, tiredness and ankle swelling); </li>
<li>hepatic cirrhosis (a type of liver disease) with ascites (a build-up of fluid in the abdomen) and 
oedema (swelling); </li>
<li>malignant ascites (a condition in which fluid containing cancer cells collect in the abdomen); </li>
<li>nephrotic syndrome (kidney disorder causing the kidneys to leak too much protein in the urine); </li>
<li>essential hypertension (high blood pressure without a known cause). </li>
</ul>
<p>Qaialdo is also used to diagnose and treat primary aldosteronism (a condition in which your body 
produces too much of a hormone called aldosterone, resulting in a build-up of fluid). Children should 
only be treated under guidance of a paediatric specialist. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Qaialdo 
- if you are allergic to spironolactone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have Addison’s disease (a disorder in which the adrenal glands do not make enough of 
certain hormones). </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels). </li>
<li>if you have anuria (a condition in which a patient cannot make or pass urine). </li>
<li>if you have sudden kidney failure. </li>
<li>if you have severe kidney disease. </li>
<li>if you are taking eplerenone (another medicine used to treat hyperaldosteronism). </li>
<li>if you are taking potassium sparing diuretics (medicines that can increase urine production 
without the loss of potassium) or any potassium supplements. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children with moderate to severe kidney disease must not take Qaialdo. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Qaialdo: 
- if you suffer from kidney disease. This is especially important for children with hypertension<br />
- if you suffer from liver disease. 
-    if you are an elderly patient and/or, have a blockage in the parts of the body that collect and pass 
out urine or suffer from a condition that can result in disturbance of electrolytes (salts such as 
sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride and bicarbonate in blood and other fluids in the body). 
- if you have severe heart failure and are treated with Qaialdo your doctor will monitor potassium 
levels in your blood due to the risk of hyperkalaemia, which may be fatal. The recommended 
monitoring for potassium and creatinine is 1 week after initiation or increase in dose of 
spironolactone, then monthly for the first 3 months, then quarterly for a year, and then every 6 
months. 
- if you experience reduced kidney function or kidney failure you may have severe increases in 
the levels of potassium in your blood. This can affect the way your heart functions and in 
extreme cases this can be fatal. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will perform regular blood tests to check levels of fluids and electrolytes 
(potassium and sodium). </p>
<p>Treatment with Qaialdo may increase levels of potassium and blood urea nitrogen (a marker for liver 
and kidney problems) and lower sodium levels, especially in the elderly and/or in patients with heart, 
kidney or liver problems. High potassium levels (hyperkalaemia) can be fatal in extreme cases.  </p>
<p>Concomitant administration of Qaialdo with certain medicines, e.g. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
(co-trimoxazole), potassium supplements and food rich in potassium may lead to severe 
hyperkalaemia.  </p>
<p>The symptoms of severe hyperkalaemia might include muscle cramps, irregular heart rhythm, 
diarrhoea, nausea, dizziness or headache. </p>
<p>Spironolactone may induce gynaecomastia (enlarged breasts), breast pain and menstrual irregularities 
(irregular periods). </p>
<p>Frequent blood tests are recommended, especially in the elderly and patients with impaired kidney 
function. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Qaialdo </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, if you are using abiraterone for treatment of prostate cancer. Use with abiraterone is 
not recommended. </p>
<p>Concurrent use with carbenoxolone or lithium salts should be avoided. </p>
<p>Your doctor may wish to alter your dose of Qaialdo if you are taking any of the following:  </p>
<ul>
<li>potassium sparing diuretics, and aldosterone blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists (risk of raised blood potassium levels) </li>
<li>antipyrine used to reduce fever  </li>
<li>colestyramine, ammonium chloride (risk of raised blood potassium levels and acidosis)  </li>
<li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, 
ibuprofen or mefenamic acid (risk of raised blood potassium levels) </li>
<li>potassium supplements (risk of raised blood potassium levels) </li>
<li>noradrenaline  </li>
<li>regional or general anaesthesia  </li>
<li>heparin, low molecular weight heparin, medicines that prevent blood clots forming (risk of 
raised blood potassium levels)  </li>
<li>medicines known to cause hyperkalaemia (risk of raised blood potassium levels)  </li>
<li>trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (risk of raised blood potassium levels) </li>
<li>medicines for high blood pressure including other diuretics; digoxin or other cardiac glycosides 
used in the treatment of heart failure. Dose adjustment of these medicines may be required. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to have an operation where you will be given an anaesthetic, tell the doctor in charge 
that you are taking Qaialdo. </p>
<p>Qaialdo with food and drink </p>
<p>The use of Qaialdo with high potassium salt diet and salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to 
increased levels of potassium in your blood. See section 2. “Do not take Qaialdo”. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Qaialdo should not be used if you are breast-feeding. You should discuss the use of Qaialdo with your 
doctor, who will advise you to consider an alternative method of feeding your baby while you are 
taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Take care if you drive or operate machinery. Drowsiness and dizziness have been associated with 
spironolactone treatment and this may affect your ability to drive or operate machinery safely. </p>
<p>Qaialdo contains sodium benzoate (E211)<br />
This medicine contains 0.75 mg sodium benzoate in each ml. Sodium benzoate may increase jaundice 
(yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old).  </p>
<p>Qaialdo contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) within the recommended dose range, that is 
to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>
<p>Qaialdo contains sucrose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.<br />
As Qaialdo 10 mg/ml contains 400 mg sucrose per ml, this has to be taken into consideration in terms 
of daily intake. This should be taken into account in patients with diabetes mellitus. 
Qaialdo may be harmful to the teeth. </p>         </div>"""
