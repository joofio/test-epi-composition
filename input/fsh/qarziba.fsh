  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Qarziba contains dinutuximab beta, which belongs to a group of medicines called  monoclonal 
antibodies . These are proteins, which specifically recognise and bind to other unique proteins in the 
body. Dinutuximab beta binds to the molecule known as disialoganglioside 2 (GD2), which is present 
on cancer cells, and this activates the body s immune system, causing it to attack the cancer cells. </p>
<p>Qarziba is used to treat neuroblastoma that has a high risk of coming back after a series of 
treatments, which include a stem cell transplantation for rebuilding the immune system. It is also used 
to treat neuroblastoma that has come back (relapsed) or could not be completely treated with previous 
therapies. </p>
<p>Prior to the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma, your treating physician will stabilise any actively 
progressing disease by other suitable measures. </p>
<p>Your doctor will further decide whether the co-administration of a second medicine, interleukin-2, is 
necessary for the treatment of your cancer. </p>
<p>Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that grows from abnormal nerve cells in the body, in particular in 
the glands above the kidneys. It is one of the most common cancers in infancy. </p>
<p>It is used for patients aged 12 months and above. </p>         </div>"""

<li>have acute grade 3 or 4, or extensive long-lasting graft-versus-host disease 
This disease is a reaction in which cells of transplanted tissue attack cells of the recipient. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Before receiving Qarziba, you will have blood tests to check your liver, lung, renal and bone marrow 
functions. </p>
<p>You might notice the following when you first receive Qarziba and during the course of treatment: 
* pain 
Pain is one of the most common side effects of Qarziba. It usually occurs at the beginning of 
infusion. Therefore, your doctor will give you an appropriate pain treatment starting 3 days 
before and continuing during use of Qarziba. 
* allergic reactions or other infusion-related reactions 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any kind of reaction during or after the infusion, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>fever, shivering and/or low blood pressure </li>
<li>difficulties in breathing </li>
<li>skin rash, hives 
You will receive appropriate treatment to prevent these reactions and be closely monitored for 
these symptoms during infusion of Qarziba. </li>
<li>leakage from small blood vessels (capillary leak syndrome) 
Leakage of blood components from small blood vessels may cause rapid swelling in arms, legs 
and other parts of the body. Rapid drop in blood pressure, light-headedness and breathing 
difficulties are further signs. </li>
<li>eye problems 
You may notice changes to your vision. </li>
<li>problems with your nerves 
You may notice numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet, legs or arms, reduced 
sensation or weakness with movement. </li>
<li>spinal cord and brain problems (central nervous system, CNS)

prolonged neurological deficit without apparent reason such as muscle weakness or loss of 
muscle strength in the legs (or arms), or mobility problems or unusual sensations and numbness. 
Persistent or sudden onset of a headache, or progressive loss of memory and cognitive ability, 
subtle personality changes, inability to concentrate, lethargy, and progressive loss of 
consciousness. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of these problems. </p>
<p>Your doctor may decide to stop your treatment if you have any of the problems mentioned here.  In 
some cases your treatment may be able to start again after a break or at a slower rate, but sometimes it 
may need to be stopped completely. </p>
<p>Your doctor will do blood tests and may do eye tests while you are taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>This medicine should not be given to children under 12 months because there is insufficient 
experience in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Qarziba </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Do not use medicines that suppress the immune system from 2 weeks before the first dose of 
Qarziba until 1 week after the last treatment course, unless prescribed by your doctor. Examples of 
medicines that suppress the immune system are corticosteroids used to reduce inflammation or prevent 
organ transplant rejection. </p>
<p>Avoid vaccinations during treatment with Qarziba and for 10 weeks afterwards.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you receive Qarziba if you are of childbearing age. It is recommended to 
use contraception for 6 months after discontinuation of treatment with Qarziba. You may only use 
Qarziba if your doctor assesses that benefits outweigh risks for a foetus. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Do not breast-feed during treatment with Qarziba and for 
6 months after the last dose. It is not known if the medicine can pass into breast-milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Qarziba has several side effects that may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not perform 
these activities if your ability to concentrate and react is affected. </p>         </div>"""

<p>This leaflet was last revised in {MM/YYYY}. </p>
<p>Other sources of information </p>
<p>Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. </p>
<hr />
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Qarziba is restricted to hospital-use only and must be administered under the supervision of a 
physician experienced in the use of oncological therapies. It must be administered by a healthcare 
professional prepared to manage severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in an environment 
where full resuscitation services are immediately available. </p>
<p>Posology 
Treatment with dinutuximab beta consists of 5 consecutive courses, each course comprising 35 days. 
The individual dose is determined based on the body surface area and should be a total of 100 mg/m2 
per course. </p>
<p>Two modes of administration are possible: 
* a continuous infusion over the first 10 days of each course (a total of 240 hours) at the daily 
dose of 10 mg/m2 
* or five daily infusions of 20 mg/m2 administered over 8 hours, on the first 5 days of each course </p>
<p>If IL-2 is combined with dinutuximab beta, it should be given as subcutaneous injections for 
5 consecutive days twice during each course. First 5-day treatment should start 7 days prior to first 
dinutuximab beta infusion. Second 5-day treatment with IL-2 should start concurrently with 
dinutuximab beta infusion (days 1 to 5 of each course). IL-2 is administered as 6 106 IU/m2/day, 
resulting in an overall dose of 60 106 IU/m2/course. </p>
<p>Preparation of the infusion 
The solution for infusion must be prepared under aseptic conditions. The solution must not be exposed 
to direct sunlight or heat. </p>
<p>The patient-specific daily dose of Qarziba is calculated based on body surface area. Qarziba should be 
diluted aseptically to the patient-specific concentration/dose with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for infusion, containing 1% human albumin (e.g. 5 mL of human albumin 20% per 100 mL 
sodium chloride solution). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For continuous infusions, the solution for infusion can be prepared freshly on a daily basis, or 
sufficient for up to 5 days of continuous infusion. The daily dose is 10 mg/m2. The amount of 
solution to be infused per day (within a treatment course of 10 consecutive days) should be 
48 mL; with 240 mL for a 5-day dose. It is recommended to prepare 50 mL solution in a 50 mL 
syringe, or 250 mL in an infusion bag suitable for the employed infusion pump, i.e. an overfill 
of 2 mL (syringe) or 10 mL (infusion bag) to allow for dead volumes of the infusion systems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For repeated daily infusions, the daily dose is 20 mg/m2 and the calculated dose should be 
diluted in 100 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) containing 1% human albumin. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Administration of the infusion 
The solution for infusion should be administered via a peripheral or central intravenous line. Other 
intravenously co-administered agents should be delivered via a separate infusion line. The container 
should be inspected visually for particulates prior to administration. It is recommended that a 
0.22 micrometre in-line filter is used during infusion. </p>
<p>For continuous infusions, any medical device suitable for infusion at a rate of 2 mL per hour can be 
applied, e.g. syringe infusion pumps/infusors, electronic ambulatory infusion pumps. Note that 
elastomeric pumps are not considered suitable in combination with in-line filters. </p>
<p>Storage of the diluted solution 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 48 hours at 25  C (50 mL 
syringe) and for up to 7 days at 37  C (250 mL infusion bag), after cumulative storage in a refrigerator 
(2  C   8  C) for 72 hours. </p>
<p>From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8  C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled 
and validated aseptic conditions. </p>
<p>Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. </p>         </div>"""
