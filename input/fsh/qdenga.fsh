  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Qdenga is a vaccine. It is used to help protect you or your child against dengue. Dengue is a disease 
caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Qdenga contains weakened versions of these 4 dengue 
virus serotypes so it cannot cause dengue disease. </p>
<p>Qdenga is given to adults, young people and children (from 4 years of age). </p>
<p>Qdenga should be used according to official recommendations. </p>
<p>How the vaccine works 
Qdenga stimulates the body s natural defences (immune system). This helps to protect against the 
viruses that cause dengue if the body is exposed to these viruses in the future. </p>
<p>What dengue is 
Dengue is caused by a virus. </p>
<p>The virus is spread by mosquitos (Aedes mosquitos). </p>
<p>If a mosquito bites someone with dengue it can pass the virus on to the next people it bites. 
Dengue is not passed directly from person to person. </p>
<p>Signs of dengue include fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, feeling or being 
sick (nausea and vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. Signs of dengue usually last for 2 to 7 days. 
You can also be infected with dengue virus but show no signs of illness. </p>
<p>Occasionally dengue can be severe enough for you or your child to have to go to hospital and in rare 
cases it can cause death. Severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe 
abdominal (belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in 
the stomach, bleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ 
failure. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>To make sure that Qdenga is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything you do 
not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain. </p>
<p>Do not use Qdenga if you or your child </p>
<p>are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Qdenga (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>had an allergic reaction after receiving Qdenga before. Signs of an allergic reaction may include 
an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue. </p>
<p>have a weak immune system (the body's natural defences). This may be due to a genetic defect or 
HIV infection. </p>
<p>are taking a medicine that affects the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or 
chemotherapy). Your doctor will not use Qdenga until 4 weeks after you stop treatment with this 
medicine. </p>
<p>are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Do not use Qdenga if any of the above applies. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Qdenga if you or your child: </p>
<p>have an infection with fever. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until recovery. </p>
<p>have ever had any health problems when given a vaccine. Your doctor will carefully consider the 
risks and benefits of vaccination. </p>
<p>have ever fainted from an injection. Dizziness, fainting, and sometimes falling, can happen 
(mostly in young people) following, or even before, any injection with a needle. </p>
<p>Important information about the protection provided 
As with any vaccine, Qdenga may not protect everybody who receives it and protection might 
decrease over time. You may still get dengue fever from mosquito bites, including severe dengue 
illness. You must continue to protect yourself or your child against mosquito bites even after 
vaccination with Qdenga. </p>
<p>After vaccination, you should consult a doctor if you or your child believe you might have a dengue 
infection, and develop any of the following symptoms: high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent 
vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, tiredness, restlessness and blood in vomit. </p>
<p>Additional protection precautions 
You should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites. This includes using insect repellents, wearing 
protective clothing, and using mosquito nets. </p>
<p>Younger children 
Children less than 4 years of age must not receive Qdenga. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Qdenga<br />
Qdenga can be given with a hepatitis A vaccine or yellow fever vaccine at a separate injection site 
(another part of your body, usually the other arm) during the same visit. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used, or might use any 
other vaccines or medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking any of the following: </p>
<p>Medicines that affect your body s natural defences (immune system) such as high-dose 
corticosteroids or chemotherapy. In this case, your doctor will not use Qdenga until 4 weeks after 
you stop treatment. This is because Qdenga might not work as well. </p>
<p>Medicines called  immunoglobulins  or blood products containing immunoglobulins, such as 
blood or plasma. In this case, your doctor will not use Qdenga until 6 weeks, and preferably not 
for 3 months after you stop treatment. This is because Qdenga might not work as well. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Qdenga if you or your daughter are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you or your daughter: </p>
<p>are of child-bearing age, you must take necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for one month 
after Qdenga vaccination. </p>
<p>think you or your daughter may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Qdenga. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Qdenga has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines in the first days following 
vaccination. </p>
<p>Qdenga contains sodium and potassium 
Qdenga contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, i.e. essentially  sodium-free . 
Qdenga contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, i.e. essentially  potassium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
