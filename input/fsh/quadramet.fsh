<p>Dosage 
One single dose of 37 megabecquerel (Becquerel is the unit in which radioactivity is measured) of 
Quadramet per kilogram of body weight is to be injected.

Quadramet is to be administered by slow injection into a vein. 
Frequency of administration 
This medicinal product is not intended to be injected on a regular or continuous basis. The 
administration can however be repeated after 8 weeks following injection, subject to the evolution of 
your disease. 
Duration of treatment 
You will be authorised to leave the nuclear medicine department after a dosimetric follow-up 
(generally within 6 hours following Quadramet injection).

<p>This is the reason why your blood counts will be monitored strictly for a few weeks following 
Quadramet injection. </p>

should not be alarmed at this; in such case, your pain medicine will be slightly increased. This effect is 
moderate and brief and will disappear after some hours. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity reactions including rare cases of anaphylactic reaction have been reported after 
Quadramet administration. </p>

possible. </p>
