Warnings and precautions 
Before taking this medicine
You should not take fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including Quinsair, if you 
have experienced any serious adverse reaction in the past when taking a quinolone or fluoroquinolone. 
In this situation, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible.
When taking this medicine
Pain and swelling in the joints and inflammation or rupture of tendons may occur rarely. Your risk is 
increased if you are elderly (above 60 years of age), have received an organ transplant, have kidney 
problems or if you are being treated with corticosteroids. Inflammation and ruptures of tendons may 
occur within the first 48 hours of treatment and even up to several months after stopping of Quinsair 
therapy. At the first sign of pain or inflammation of a tendon (for example in your ankle, wrist, elbow, 
shoulder or knee), stop taking Quinsair, contact your doctor and rest the painful area. Avoid any 
unnecessary exercise as this might increase the risk of a tendon rupture.
Tell your doctor before using Quinsair 
if you have or have ever had any of the following:
-
Prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious side effects
Fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including Quinsair, have been associated 
with very rare but serious side effects, some of them being long lasting (continuing months or 
years), disabling or potentially irreversible. This includes tendon, muscle and joint pain of the 
upper and lower limbs, difficulty walking, abnormal sensations such as pins and needles, 
tingling, tickling, numbness or burning (paraesthesia), sensory disorders including impairment 
of vision, taste and smell, and hearing, depression, memory impairment, severe fatigue, and 
severe sleep disorders.
If you experience any of these side effects after taking Quinsair, contact your doctor 
immediately prior to continuing treatment. You and your doctor will decide on continuing the 
treatment considering also an antibiotic from another class.
-
Severe kidney problems.
-
A severe allergic reaction. Symptoms are listed in section 4. -
Severe skin reactions
If you are treated with Quinsair, you may have a severe skin reaction such as blistering or 
lesions. Tell your doctor if you notice any skin reactions after using Quinsair.
-
Liver problems. Symptoms are listed in section 4. -
Heart rhythm abnormalities
Quinsair can cause changes to your heart rhythm, especially if you are taking any medicines to 
treat heart problems or low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood. Women who take 
these types of medicines may be more likely to be affected. If you experience palpitations or an 
irregular heart beat whilst using Quinsair you should tell your doctor immediately.
-
Seizures and convulsions
Quinolone antibiotics, including Quinsair, may cause seizures or convulsions (fits). If this 
happens, stop using Quinsair and contact your doctor immediately.
-
Depression or mental health problems.
-
Nerve damage
You may rarely experience symptoms of nerve damage (neuropathy) such as pain, burning, 
tingling, numbness and/or weakness especially in the feet and legs or hands and arms. If this 
happens, stop taking Quinsair and inform your doctor immediately in order to prevent the 
development of potentially irreversible condition.
-
A disease causing muscle weakness and fatigue called myasthenia gravis.
-
Inflammation of a tendon causing pain, stiffness and/or swelling in the joints (tendonitis).
-
If you have experienced difficulty in breathing after receiving Quinsair, which can range from 
mild to severe (bronchospasm).
-
Coughing up blood or blood-stained mucus from the airways.
-
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogensae deficiency
Quinolone antibiotics, such as Quinsair, can cause patients with glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficiency (a rare hereditary disease) to be prone to blood complications leading 
to a sudden rise in body temperature, yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes, dark 
coloured urine, paleness, tiredness, heavy, fast breathing and a weak, rapid pulse. Talk to your 
doctor if you have any questions about this.
-
Diabetes
Quinolone antibiotics, including Quinsair, may cause levels of glucose in the blood to be either 
too high or too low. If you are diabetic, you should monitor your blood glucose levels carefully.
-
Diarrhoea
You may develop diarrhoea during or after your treatment with Quinsair. If this becomes severe 
or persistent, or you notice blood in your stools, you should stop using Quinsair immediately 
and talk to your doctor. Do not take any medicines to treat your diarrhoea without first checking 
with your doctor.
-
Resistance to antibiotics
Bacteria can become resistant to treatment with an antibiotic over time. This means that 
Quinsair should not be used to prevent lung infections. It should only be used to treat lung 
infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns or 
questions about this.
-
Superinfections
Sometimes lengthy treatment with antibiotics can mean that you get another infection caused by 
other bacteria which are not affected by the antibiotic (superinfection). Talk to your doctor if 
you have any concerns or questions about this and using Quinsair.
-
Vision problems
If you notice any changes in your eyesight or any other problems with your eyes whilst using 
Quinsair, contact an eye specialist immediately. 
-
Photosensitivity
Quinsair may make your skin become more sensitive to sunlight. You should avoid prolonged 
exposure to sunlight or strong sunlight and should not use sunbeds or any other UV lamps 
whilst using Quinsair and for 48 hours after stopping treatment. 
-
False test results
Certain tests (e.g. to confirm tuberculosis or screening for strong painkillers) may give false 
results whilst you are being treated with Quinsair.
-
if you have been diagnosed with an enlargement or "bulge" of a large blood vessel (aortic 
aneurysm or large vessel peripheral aneurysm).
 - if you have experienced a previous episode of aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta wall).
- if you have been diagnosed with leaking heart valves (heart valve regurgitation).
-
if you have a family history of aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection or congenital heart valve 
disease, or other risk factors or predisposing conditions (e.g. connective tissue disorders such as 
Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, Sj gren s syndrome [an 
inflammatory autoimmune disease], or vascular disorders such as Takayasu arteritis, giant cell 
arteritis, Behcet s disease, high blood pressure, or known atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis [a 
disease of the joints,] or endocarditis [an infection of the heart]).
If you feel sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, chest or back, which can be symptoms of aortic 
aneurysm and dissection, go immediately to an emergency room. Your risk may be increased if you 
are being treated with systemic corticosteroids.
If you start experiencing a rapid onset of shortness of breath, especially when you lie down flat in your 
bed, or you notice swelling of your ankles, feet or abdomen, or a new onset of heart palpitations 
(sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeat), you should inform a doctor immediately.
Children and adolescents
Quinsair should not be given to children and adolescents less than 18 years old as there is not enough 
information about its use in this age group.
Other medicines and Quinsair
Tell your doctor or a pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. These medicines may interfere with the effects of Quinsair.
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:
-
Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin (used to prevent blood clots). Taking these medicines 
with Quinsair may lead to an increase in bleeding. Your doctor may need to give you regular 
blood tests to check how well your blood can clot.
-
Theophylline (used to treat breathing problems) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines 
(NSAIDs) such as fenbufen, acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used 
to relieve pain and lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting) or ibuprofen. Taking 
Quinsair at the same time as these medicines could increase your risk of a fit (seizure). 
-
Medicines such as probenecid (used to prevent gout) or cimetidine (used to treat ulcers). 
Taking Quinsair at the same time as these medicines could affect how your kidneys deal with 
the medicine which is particularly important if you suffer from kidney problems.
-
Ciclosporin (used after organ transplants) or medicines that affect your heart beat (such as 
antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolide antibiotics or antipsychotics). Quinsair can 
interfere with the effects of these medicines. Your doctor will explain more.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Quinsair must not be used whilst pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking 
this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Quinsair may make you feel dizzy, tired or weak, or cause problems with your eyesight. If this 
happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines.</p>         </div>"""

How much do I use?
Inhale the contents of one ampoule (240 mg) twice a day using the Zirela Nebuliser System. It 
takes about 5 minutes to inhale the medicine using the nebuliser.
When do I use it?
Inhaling Quinsair at the same time each day will help you remember when to take your medicine. 
Inhale your medicine as follows:
-
1 ampoule in the morning using the Zirela Nebuliser 
-
1 ampoule in the evening using the Zirela Nebuliser 
It is best to leave close to 12 hours between your doses.
How long do I use it for?
You use Quinsair every day for 28 days, then take a 28-day break, during which you do not inhale any 
Quinsair. You then start another treatment course.
It is important that you keep using the medicine twice a day during your 28 days on treatment and that 
you keep to the 28-days on, 28-days off cycle for as long as your doctor tells you to.
If you experience breathing difficulties when you use Quinsair what additional medicine may 
your doctor prescribe for you?
If you experience breathing difficulties after using Quinsair, your doctor may prescribe you an inhaler 
containing a bronchodilator medicine (e.g. salbutamol). Inhale this medicine at least 15 minutes or up 
to 4 hours before your next dose of Quinsair.
What if I am using several different inhalers and other therapies for cystic fibrosis?
If you are using several different inhaled treatments and other therapies for cystic fibrosis, it is 
recommended that you use your medicines in the following order:
1st 
Bronchodilators
2nd 
Dornase alfa
3rd 
Airway clearance techniques
4th 
Quinsair
5th 
Inhaled steroids
How to use it
Quinsair should be taken by inhalation using a Zirela Nebuliser Handset (including a Zirela Aerosol 
Head). This should be connected to either an eBase Controller or an eFlow rapid Control Unit.
Important information to know before you start
-
Each ampoule is for single use only. Once an ampoule is opened, the contents should be 
used immediately.
-
Do not use Quinsair if you notice that the sealed foil sachet or ampoules have been tampered 
with.
-
Do not use Quinsair if you notice that it is cloudy or there are particles in the solution.
-
Do not mix Quinsair with any other medicines in the Zirela Nebuliser Handset.
-
Do not put any medicines other than Quinsair in the Zirela Nebuliser Handset.
-
Do not try to inhale Quinsair using any other type of nebuliser handset.
-
Check that your Zirela Nebuliser System works properly before starting your treatment.
-
Do not swallow the liquid in the ampoule.
Carefully read the Manufacturer s Instructions for Use, provided with your Zirela Nebuliser Handset.
ON Quinsair
Use it twice a day for 
28 days
OFF Quinsair
Do not use it for the 
next 28 days
Repeat cycle
How do I prepare my Nebuliser System to inhale the medicine?
Keep the Zirela Instructions for Use in a safe place as they give full details on assembling the device.
1)
Make sure that the Zirela Nebuliser Handset is on a flat and stable surface.
2)
Squeeze all of the contents of one ampoule into the medicine reservoir of the Zirela Nebuliser 
Handset (Figure 1). Ensure that you completely empty the ampoule, gently tapping it against the 
side of the reservoir if necessary.
Figure 1
3)
Close the medicine reservoir by aligning the tabs of the medicine cap with the slots of the 
reservoir (a). Press down and turn the cap clockwise as far as it will go (b, Figure 2).
Figure 2
How do I use the Zirela Nebuliser System?
1) 
When you start your treatment, sit in a relaxed, upright position. 
2)
Hold the handset level, press and hold the on/off button on the controller for a few seconds. 
You will hear one  beep  and the status light will turn green.
3)
After a few seconds, an aerosol mist will begin to flow into the aerosol chamber of the Zirela 
Nebuliser Handset. If aerosol mist does not begin to flow, please refer to the Zirela 
Manufacturer s Instructions for Use for help.
4)
Keeping the handset level, place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it 
(Figure 3).
Figure 3
5)
Breathe normally (inhale and exhale) through the mouthpiece. Try not to breathe through your 
nose. Continue to inhale and exhale comfortably until the treatment is finished. It takes about 
5 minutes to inhale the medicine using the nebuliser.
6)
When all of the medicine has been delivered, you will hear two  beeps , which means the 
treatment is complete.
7)
Once complete, open the medicine cap to ensure all of the medicine has been used. A few 
drops of medicine may remain at the bottom of the reservoir at the end of treatment. This is ok. 
However if there are more than a few drops left, replace the medicine cap and restart treatment, 
from step 1. 8)
Once treatment is complete, disconnect the controller and take apart the Zirela Nebuliser 
Handset for cleaning and disinfecting. The Manufacturer s Instructions for Use will give full 
details on cleaning and disinfecting.
What if I need to stop my treatment before I ve finished?
If for any reason you must stop the treatment before it's finished, press and hold the controller s on/off 
button for one second. After it has completely turned itself off and when you are ready to restart, press 
and hold the on/off button for one second again. Treatment will restart. You must inhale and exhale 
through the mouthpiece as before.
How and when do I replace the Zirela Nebuliser Handset?
One nebuliser handset should be used for one 28-day treatment course. Please refer to the 
Manufacturer s Instructions for Use for cleaning and storage advice.
If you use more Quinsair than you should
If you have used more Quinsair than you should, tell your doctor as soon as possible. You may 
experience symptoms like irregular heart beat, which needs to be checked by your doctor. If the 
contents of the ampoule are swallowed, don t worry but tell your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to use Quinsair
If you forget a dose, use it as soon as you remember as long as there is an 8-hour interval before 
inhaling the next dose. However if it is nearly the time for your next dose, skip the missed dose.
Do not inhale the contents of more than one ampoule to make up for a missed dose.
If you stop using Quinsair
Do not stop using Quinsair without first talking to your doctor as your lung infection may worsen.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
