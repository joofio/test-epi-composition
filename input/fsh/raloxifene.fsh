  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Raloxifene Teva is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene Teva 
reduces the risk of vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. A reduction in the 
risk of hip fractures has not been shown.   </p>
<p>How Raloxifene Teva works </p>
<p>Raloxifene Teva belongs to a group of non-hormonal medicines called selective oestrogen receptor 
modulators (SERMs). When a woman reaches the menopause, the level of the female sex hormone 
oestrogen goes down. Raloxifene Teva mimics some of the helpful effects of oestrogen after the 
menopause. </p>
<p>Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and fragile - this disease is especially 
common in women after the menopause. Although it may have no symptoms at first, osteoporosis 
makes you more likely to break bones, especially in your spine, hips and wrists and may cause back 
pain, loss of height and a curved back. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to raloxifene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). <br />
- If there is still a possibility that you can get pregnant, Raloxifene Teva could harm your unborn 
child.  <br />
- If you are being treated or have been treated for blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism or retinal vein thrombosis). <br />
- If you have liver disease (examples of liver disease include cirrhosis, mild hepatic impairment 
or cholestatic jaundice). 
- If you have any unexplained vaginal bleeding. This must be investigated by your doctor. 
- If you have active uterine cancer, as there is insufficient experience of Raloxifene Teva use in 
women with this disease. 
- If you have severe kidney problems.   </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Raloxifene Teva:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are immobilised for some time such as being wheel-chair bound, needing to be admitted 
to a hospital or having to stay in bed while recovering from an operation or an unexpected 
illness. </li>
<li>If you are receiving oral oestrogen therapy. </li>
<li>If you are suffering from breast cancer, as there is insufficient experience of Raloxifene Teva 
use in women with this disease. </li>
<li>If you have had a cerebrovascular accident (e.g. stroke), or if your doctor has told you that you 
are at high risk of having one.  </li>
<li>If you have liver problems, as there is insufficient experience in people with liver problems. If 
you do have liver problems and your doctor still recommends treatment, then you may need 
some blood tests during treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is unlikely that Raloxifene Teva will cause vaginal bleeding. So any vaginal bleeding while you take 
Raloxifene Teva is unexpected. You should have this investigated by your doctor. </p>
<p>Raloxifene Teva does not treat postmenopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes.   </p>
<p>Raloxifene Teva lowers total cholesterol and LDL ("bad") cholesterol. In general, it does not change 
triglycerides or HDL ("good") cholesterol. However, if you have taken oestrogen in the past and had 
extreme elevations in triglycerides, you should talk to your doctor before taking Raloxifene Teva. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Raloxifene Teva </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If you are taking digitalis medicines for your heart or anticoagulants like warfarin to thin your blood, 
your doctor may need to adjust your dose of these medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking cholestyramine which is mainly used as lipid-lowering medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Raloxifene Teva is for use only by postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women who 
could still have a baby. Raloxifene Teva could harm your unborn child. </p>
<p>Do not take Raloxifene Teva if you are breast-feeding as it might be excreted in mother's milk. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicines. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Raloxifene Teva has no or negligible effects on driving or using machines.   </p>         </div>"""
