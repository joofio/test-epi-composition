6).

coronary artery bypass graft, or surgery or injury to the head or spine), given birth, or had an

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Bleeding 
The most common side effect of Rapilysin is bleeding. Therefore Rapilysin must be given only in the 
presence and under the instructions of an emergency doctor. </p>
<p>Pay careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (e.g. injection sites). Heparin, which is given 
together with Rapilysin, may also increase bleeding. </p>
<p>The risks of Rapilysin treatment may be increased if you have any of the following conditions: 
* diseases of the blood vessels in the brain 
* systolic blood pressure higher than 160 mmHg 
* bleeding in the gastrointestinal, urinary or genital tract within the past 10 days 
* high likelihood of a blood clot in the heart (e.g. as a result of narrowing of a heart valve or atrial 
fibrillation) 
* septic inflammation of a vein with blood clotting (septic thrombophlebitis) or blocked blood 
vessels at an infected site 
* age over 75 years 
* any other condition in which bleeding might be especially dangerous or might occur at a site 
where it would be difficult to control 
At present, little data are available on the use of Rapilysin in patients with diastolic blood pressure 
higher than 100 mmHg. </p>
<p>Abnormal heart beats (arrhythmias) 
Thrombolytic treatment may cause the heart to beat irregularly. Therefore tell the medical staff 
immediately if you </p>
<ul>
<li>feel palpitations or an irregular heart beat </li>
</ul>
<p>Repeated use 
At present there is no experience with repeated use of Rapilysin. Therefore, repeated use is not 
recommended. Antibody formation to the reteplase molecule has not been seen. </p>
<p>Children 
Safety and effectiveness of Rapilysin in children have not been established. Treatment of children with 
Rapilysin is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rapilysin: 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Heparin and other medicines that thin the blood (anticoagulants) and acetylsalicylic acid (a substance 
used in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever) may increase the risk of bleeding. </p>
<p>For information on medicines that should not be physically mixed with Rapilysin solution for 
injection, see section 3.<br />
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
There is no experience with Rapilysin in pregnant women. Therefore it should not be used except in 
life-threatening situations. You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you are pregnant. 
Your doctor can tell you the risks and benefits of using Rapilysin during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Rapilysin as it is not known whether 
Rapilysin is excreted into mother’s milk. Mother’s milk should be thrown away during the first hours after thrombolytic treatment. Discuss with your doctor when you can take up breast-feeding 
again. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Rapilysin is usually given in a hospital. The medicine is supplied in vials as a powder for injection. 
Before use, the powder for injection must be dissolved in the water for injection supplied in the 
prefilled syringe that is in the package. Do not add any other medicines. The resulting solution must be 
used immediately. The solution must be examined to ensure that only clear, colourless solution is 
injected. If the solution is not clear and colourless it should be thrown away. </p>
<p>Treatment with Rapilysin 10 U should be started as soon as possible after the symptoms of heart attack 
begin. </p>
<p>Heparin and Rapilysin cannot be mixed in the same solution. Other medicines may also not mix well 
with Rapilysin. No other medicines should be added to the injection solution (see below). Rapilysin 
should be injected preferably through an intravenous line that is used only for the injection of 
Rapilysin. No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin, either at the 
same time, or before or after Rapilysin injection. This applies to all medicines including heparin and 
acetylsalicylic acid, which are given before and after Rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood clots 
forming. 
If the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed thoroughly with a 0.9 % 
sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution before and after the Rapilysin injection.  </p>
<p>Dosage of Rapilysin 
Rapilysin is given as a 10 U injection followed by a second 10 U injection 30 minutes later (double 
bolus).  </p>
<p>Each injection should be given slowly within 2 minutes. The injection must not be given mistakenly 
outside the vein. Therefore, be sure to tell the medical staff if you experience pain during the injection. </p>
<p>Heparin and acetylsalicylic acid are given before and after Rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood 
clots forming. </p>
<p>Dosage of Heparin 
The recommended dose of heparin is 5000 I.U. given as a single injection before Rapilysin, followed 
by an infusion of 1000 I.U. per hour starting after the second Rapilysin injection. Heparin should be 
given for at least 24 hours, preferably for 48-72 hours, in order to keep aPTT values 1.5 to 2 times 
normal. </p>
<p>Dosage of Acetylsalicylic Acid<br />
The dose of acetylsalicylic acid given before Rapilysin should be at least 250 mg-350 mg and should 
be followed by 75-150 mg/day, at least until discharge from hospital. </p>
<p>If more Rapilysin is used than recommended 
In the event of overdosage there may be an increased risk of bleeding. </p>         </div>"""

urinary or genital tract<br />
* Abnormal heart beats (arrhythmias), cardiac arrest, circulatory collapse or another heart attack 
may occur </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* Bleeding around the heart, in the abdomen, the brain or the eyes, under the skin, from the nose 
or as coughed up blood 
* Damage to the heart or heart valves, or a blood clot in the lung, brain or other part of body 
mayoccur 
* hypersensitivity (e.g. allergic reactions) </p>
<p>Very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people)

<p>Side effects of frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
* Blockage of blood vessels due to cholesterol (fat) </p>
<p>Cardiovascular events can be life-threatening or cause death.  </p>
<p>Patients with systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg have a greater risk of bleeding in the brain. The 
risk of intracranial bleeding and fatal intracranial bleeding increases with increasing age. Blood 
transfusions were rarely required. Death or permanent disability are not uncommon in patients who 
have a stroke (including bleeding in the brain) or other serious bleeding problem. </p>
<p>Be sure to tell hospital staff immediately if any of these symptoms appear.  </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
