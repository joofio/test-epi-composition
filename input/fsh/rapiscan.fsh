  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Rapiscan contains the active substance regadenoson. This belongs to a group of medicines called 
‘coronary vasodilators’. It makes the heart arteries expand and heart rate increase. This makes more 
blood flow to the muscles of the heart. </p>
<p>This medicine is for diagnostic use only. </p>
<p>Rapiscan is used in a type of heart scan in adults called ‘myocardial perfusion imaging’. </p>
<p>The scan uses a diagnostic agent to create images. These images show how well blood flows to the 
muscles of the heart. Usually, exercise on a treadmill is used to put the heart under stress before a 
scan. During the exercise, a small amount of the diagnostic agent is injected into the body, often into a 
vein in the hand. Images are then taken of the heart. The doctor can then see if the heart muscles are 
getting enough blood flow when it is under stress.<br />
If you are unable to exercise enough to reach sufficient stress to the heart, Rapiscan will be injected to 
provide a stress of similar amplitude to the heart to increase the blood flow.<br />
Rapiscan is also used during catheterisation and imaging arteries of the heart (invasive coronary 
angiography) to expand the arteries of the heart to measure the difference in pressure, caused by a 
narrowing within one or more arteries. During cardiac catheterisation, a long thin tube called a 
catheter is inserted either through your femoral or radial artery and threaded through your blood 
vessels to your heart. The doctor performing the catheterisation may also want to measure the 
difference in pressure (fractional flow reserve) due to a narrowing detected in one or more arteries of 
the heart. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Rapiscan: 
* if you have slow heart rate (high degree heart block or sinus node disease), and don’t have a 
pacemaker fitted. 
* if you have chest pain that occurs unpredictably (unstable angina) and that has not improved after 
treatment. 
* if you have low blood pressure (hypotension). 
* if you have heart failure. </p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to regadenoson or any of the other ingredients of Rapiscan listed in section 6 of 
this leaflet. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before taking Rapiscan 
Your doctor needs to know before you are given Rapiscan: 
* if you have had a recent serious heart problem (for example a heart attack or abnormal heart 
rhythms). 
* if you have a heart rhythm where your heartbeat is very fast or uneven (atrial fibrillation or atrial 
flutter) 
* if you have high blood pressure that is not controlled, especially if this has been accompanied by 
recent episodes of nose bleed, headache or blurred or double vision. 
* if you have had episodes of mini strokes (called transient ischaemic attacks)<br />
<em> if you have a heart rhythm disorder called long QT syndrome. 
* if you have episodes of heart block (which can slow the heart down) or a very slow heart rate.<br />
</em> if you have any heart or blood vessel condition, particularly one that gets worse when your 
blood pressure decreases. These include low blood volume (caused, for example, by severe 
diarrhoea or dehydration or taking water pills), inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) and 
some forms of heart valve or artery disease (for example, aortic or mitral stenosis). 
* if you have a condition that causes fits (seizures), such as epilepsy, or if you have ever had fits. 
* if you have asthma or lung disease. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before you are given the injection. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Rapiscan should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rapiscan 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines including 
medicines obtained without prescription. </p>
<p>Particular care should be taken with the following medicines: 
* theophylline, a medicine used to treat asthma and other lung diseases, must not be used for at 
least 12 hours before you are given Rapiscan because it can block the effect of Rapiscan. 
* dipyridamole, a medicine used to prevent blood clots, must not be used for at least two days 
before you are given Rapiscan because it can change the effect of Rapiscan. </p>
<p>Rapiscan with food and drink 
Do not eat food or have drinks containing caffeine (for example, tea, coffee, cocoa, cola or chocolate) 
for at least 12 hours before you are given Rapiscan. This is because caffeine can interfere with the 
effect of Rapiscan. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Before you are given Rapiscan, tell your doctor: 
* if you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or planning to have a baby. There is no adequate 
information on the use of Rapiscan in pregnant women. Harmful effects have been seen in 
animal studies but it is not known if there is a risk to humans. Your doctor will only give you 
Rapiscan if it is clearly necessary. 
* if you are breast-feeding. It is not known whether Rapiscan can pass into breast milk and will 
only be given to you if your doctor thinks it is necessary. You should avoid breast-feeding for at 
least 10 hours after you are given Rapiscan. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice before using any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Rapiscan may make you feel dizzy. It may cause other symptoms (headache or shortness of breath) 
that could affect your ability to drive or use machinery. These effects usually do not last longer than 
30 minutes. Do not drive or operate machinery until these effects have improved. </p>
<p>Rapiscan contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. After you have been given 
Rapiscan, you will be given an injection of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution which contains 
45 mg of sodium. To be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

medical facility where your heart and blood pressure can be monitored. It is injected directly into a 
vein, as a single dose of 400 micrograms in a 5 ml solution – the injection will take about 10 seconds 
to complete. The dose injected does not depend on your weight. </p>
<p>You will also be given an injection of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution (5 ml), and an 
injection of a small amount of a diagnostic agent. 
When you are given Rapiscan, your heart rate will increase quickly. Your heart rate and blood 
pressure will be monitored. </p>
<p>After the Rapiscan injection you will need to sit or lie down until your heart rate and blood pressure 
return to your normal levels. The doctor, nurse or medical technician will let you know when you can 
stand up. </p>
<p>A scan of your heart will be made after enough time has passed to allow the diagnostic agent to reach 
the heart muscle.<br />
During catheterisation of the arteries of the heart, your doctor may measure the pressure difference 
(also known as fractional flow reserve – FFR) due to a narrowing in one or more arteries of the heart.  </p>

first dose for such pressure difference measurement during the same catheterization procedure. Heart 
rate and blood pressure will be monitored during the entire procedure. </p>
<p>If you are given more Rapiscan than you should 
Some people have had flushing, dizziness and increased heart rate when they have been given too 
much Rapiscan. If your doctor thinks that you are having severe side effects, or the effects of Rapiscan 
are lasting too long, they may give you an injection of a medicine called aminophylline that reduces

<p>For the measurement of FFR, Rapiscan should be administered as a rapid, 10-second injection into a 
peripheral vein using a 22-gauge or larger catheter or needle. 10 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9%) solution for injection should be administered immediately after the injection of Rapiscan. 
Standard catheterisation and FFR measurement techniques are to be followed, and FFR should be measured 
as the lowest value of Pd/Pa achieved during steady state maximum hyperemia. </p>
<p>If deemed necessary, a second dose of 400 micrograms can be injected at least 10 minutes after the 
first dose for FFR measurement during the same catheterization procedure. </p>
