section 6). </li>
<li>if you have severe liver problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not take the following medicines while taking Rasagiline Mylan:</p>
<ul>
<li>monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g. for treatment of depression or Parkinson s disease, 
or used for any other indication), including medicinal and natural products without prescription 
e.g. St. John's Wort. </li>
<li>pethidine (a strong pain killer). 
You must wait at least 14 days after stopping Rasagiline Mylan treatment and starting treatment with 
MAO inhibitors or pethidine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Rasagiline Mylan. 
- if you have  any liver problems 
- if you have any suspicious skin changes. Treatment with Rasagiline Mylan may possibly 
increase the risk of skin cancer. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing unusual 
behaviours where you cannot resist the impulse, urges or cravings to carry out certain harmful or 
detrimental activities to yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders. In patients 
taking Rasagiline Mylan and/or other medicines used to treat Parkinson s disease, behaviours such as 
compulsions, obsessive thoughts, addictive gambling, excessive spending, impulsive behaviour and an 
abnormally high sex drive or an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings have been observed. Your 
doctor may need to adjust or stop your dose (see section 4). </p>
<p>Rasagiline Mylan may cause drowsiness and may cause you to suddenly fall asleep during day 
time activities, especially if you are taking other dopaminergic medicinal products (used for the 
treatment of Parkinson s disease). For further information please refer to section driving and using 
machines. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is no relevant use of Rasagiline Mylan in children and adolescents. Therefore, Rasagiline Mylan 
is not recommended for use under the age of 1</p>         </div>"""

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice before taking any of the following medicines together with Rasagiline 
Mylan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants) </li>
<li>the antibiotic ciprofloxacin used against infections </li>
<li>the cough suppressant dextromethorphan </li>
<li>sympathomimetics such as those present in eye drops, nasal and oral decongestants and cold 
medicine containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of Rasagiline Mylan together with the antidepressants containing fluoxetine or fluvoxamine 
should be avoided. </p>
<p>If you are starting treatment with Rasagiline Mylan, you should wait at least 5 weeks after stopping 
fluoxetine treatment. </p>
<p>If you are starting treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, you should wait at least 14 days after 
stopping Rasagiline Mylan treatment. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are smoking or intend to stop smoking. Smoking could decrease 
the amount of Rasagiline Mylan in the blood. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should avoid taking Rasagiline Mylan if you are pregnant, as the effects of Rasagiline Mylan on 
pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ask your doctor for advice before you drive and operate machines, since Parkinson s disease itself as 
well as the treatment with Rasagiline Mylan may influence your ability to do so. Rasagiline Mylan can 
make you feel dizzy or drowsy; it can also cause episodes of sudden sleep onset. 
This might be enhanced if you take other medicines to treat the symptoms of your Parkinson s disease, 
or if you take medicines which can make you feel drowsy, or if you drink alcohol while taking 
Rasagiline Mylan. If you have experienced somnolence and/or episodes of sudden sleep onset before, 
or while taking Rasagiline Mylan do not drive or operate machinery (see section 2). </p>         </div>"""
