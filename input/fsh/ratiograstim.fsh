Ratiograstim is a white blood cell growth factor (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and belong to 
a group of medicines called cytokines. Growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally in the 
body but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. Ratiograstim works by 
encouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. </p>
<p>What Ratiograstim is used for 
A reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes 
your body less able to fight infection. Ratiograstim stimulates the bone marrow to produce new white 
cells quickly. </p>
<p>Ratiograstim can be used 
- to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent 
infections. 
- to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent 
infections. 
- before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be 
collected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from a 
donor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells. 
- to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help 
prevent infections. 
- in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections. </p>         </div>"""

the heart to the body), this has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The 
symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory 
markers. Tell your doctor if you experience those symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Loss of response to filgrastim </p>
<p>If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your 
doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise filgrastim s activity. </p>
<p>Your doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet.  </p>
<p>If you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the 
blood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]). You should talk to your doctor about your risks

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How is Ratiograstim given and much should I take? </p>
<p>Ratiograstim is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a 
subcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an 
intravenous infusion). The usual dose varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will 
tell you how much Ratiograstim you should take. </p>
<p>Patients having a bone marrow transplant after chemotherapy: 
You will normally receive your first dose of Ratiogratsim at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy 
and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. </p>
<p>You, or people caring for you, can be taught how to give subcutaneous injections so that you can 
continue your treatment at home. However, you should not attempt this unless you have been properly 
trained first by your health care provider. </p>
<p>How long will I have to take Ratiograstim? 
You will need to take Ratiograstim until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood tests 
will be taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you how 
long you will need to take Ratiograstim. </p>
<p>Use in children 
Ratiograstim is used to treat children who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from severe low 
white blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children receiving chemotherapy is the same as for 
adults. </p>
<p>If you use more Ratiograstim than you should 
Do not increase the dose your doctor has given you. If you use more Ratiograstim than you should, 
contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Ratiograstim 
If you have missed an injection, or injected too little, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for any missed doses. </p>

<p>Important side effects </p>
<p>It is important to contact your doctor immediately 
- if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the 
face lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). 
- if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 
- if you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients 
who received filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or 
ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual. 
- if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: 
  swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty 
breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. 
These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. 
These could be symptoms of condition called  capillary leak syndrome , which causes blood to 
leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. 
- if you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: 
  fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, 
shortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. 
These could be symptoms of a condition called  sepsis  (also called "blood poisoning"), a 
severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life-threatening and 
needs urgent medical attention. 
- if you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of 
your shoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen 
(splenomegaly) or rupture of the spleen). 
- if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine 
(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if 
protein is found in your urine (proteinuria). </p>
<p>A common side effect of Ratiograstim use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), 
which could be relieved by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a 
stem cell or bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur- this is a reaction of 
the donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the 
palms of your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your 
eyes, lungs, vagina and joints. </p>
<p>In normal stem cell donors an increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) and a decrease of platelets 
may be seen this reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia), these will be 
monitored by your doctor. </p>
<p>You may experience the following side effects: </p>

* increase in white blood cells (leukocytosis) 
* allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) 
* rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease) 
* high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (blood uric acid 
increased) 
* liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease) 
* lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure) 
* swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema)
