<p>Idebenone is used to treat vision impairment in adults and adolescents with an eye disease called 
Leber s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON).<br />
- This eye problem is inherited   this means it runs in families. 
- It is caused by a problem with your genes (called a  genetic mutation ) that affects the ability of 
cells in the eye to produce the energy they need to work normally, so they become inactive. 
- LHON can lead to loss of eyesight due to the inactivity of cells responsible for vision.  </p>
<p>Treatment with Raxone can restore the ability of cells to produce energy and so allow inactive eye 
cells to work again. This can lead to some improvement in lost eyesight.  </p>         </div>"""
