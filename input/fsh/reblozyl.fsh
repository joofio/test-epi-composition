<p>Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a collection of many different blood and bone marrow 
disorders.<br />
<em> Red blood cells become abnormal and do not develop properly.<br />
</em> Patients can get a number of signs and symptoms including a low red blood cell count 
(anaemia) and may need red blood cell transfusions.  </p>
<p>Reblozyl is used in adults with anaemia caused by MDS, who need red blood cell transfusions. 
It is used in adults who have already had or are not able to have erythropoietin therapies. </p>
<p>Beta-thalassaemia 
 -thalassaemia is a blood problem that is passed down through genes.<br />
<em> It affects the production of haemoglobin.<br />
</em> Patients can get a number of signs and symptoms including a low red blood cell count 
(anaemia) and may need red blood cell transfusions. </p>
<p>Reblozyl is used to treat anaemia in adults with  -thalassaemia who may or may not need 
regular red blood cell transfusions. </p>
<p>How Reblozyl works 
Reblozyl improves your body s ability to make red blood cells. Red blood cells contain 
haemoglobin, which is a protein that carries oxygen throughout your body. As your body makes 
more red blood cells, your haemoglobin level increases. </p>
<p>For MDS and  -thalassaemia patients in need of regular blood transfusions<br />
Having Reblozyl can avoid or reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. 
* Red blood cell transfusions can cause abnormally high levels of iron in the blood and in 
different organs of the body. This can be harmful over time. </p>
<p>For  -thalassaemia patients not in need of regular blood transfusions<br />
Having Reblozyl can improve your aneamia by increasing your haemoglobin level.  </p>         </div>"""
