or develop kidney problems while receiving Recarbrio (see section 3).
Children and adolescents
Recarbrio should not be used in children or adolescents who are under 18 years of age. This is because
it is not known if the medicine is safe to use in these patients.
Other medicines and Recarbrio
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, especially if you take:</p>
<p>medicines that contain ganciclovir, used for treating some viral infections</p>
<p>medicines that contain valproic acid or divalproex sodium, usually used for treating epilepsy,
bipolar disorder, or migraine</p>

Pregnancy and breastfeeding
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Recarbrio may make you feel dizzy, shaky, or cause convulsions or seizures. This may affect your
ability to drive or use machines.
Recarbrio contains sodium
This medicine contains approximately 37.5 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/ table salt) in
each vial. This is equivalent to about 2 % of the adult recommended maximum amount of sodium you
should take daily, and needs to be taken into account if you are on a low-salt diet.</p>         </div>"""

The course of treatment usually lasts from 5 up to 14 days, depending on the type of infection you
have and how you respond to treatment.
If you are given more Recarbrio than you should
Recarbrio will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong
dose. If you think you have been given too much Recarbrio, tell your doctor or nurse right away.
If you miss a dose of Recarbrio

<em>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em>
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Recarbrio is supplied as a dry powder in a single-dose vial that must be constituted and further diluted
using aseptic technique prior to intravenous infusion as outlined below:</p>
<p>To prepare the infusion solution, contents of the vial must be transferred to 100 mL of an
appropriate infusion solution: 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) sodium chloride. In exceptional
circumstances where 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) sodium chloride cannot be used for clinical
reasons 5 % glucose may be used instead.</p>
<p>Withdraw 20 mL (10 mL times 2) of diluent from the appropriate infusion bag and
constitute the vial with 10 mL of the diluent. The constituted suspension must not be
administered by direct intravenous infusion.</p>
<p>After constitution, shake vial well and transfer resulting suspension into the remaining
80 mL of the infusion bag.</p>
<p>Add the additional 10 mL of infusion diluent to the vial and shake well to ensure complete
transfer of vial contents; repeat transfer of the resulting suspension to the infusion solution
before administering. Agitate the resulting mixture until clear. </p>
<p>Constituted solutions of Recarbrio range from colorless to yellow. Variations of color
within this range do not affect the potency of the product.</p>
<p>For patients with renal insufficiency, a reduced dose of Recarbrio will be administered
according to the patient's CrCl, as determined from the table below. Prepare 100 mL of
infusion solution as directed above. Select the volume (mL) of the final infusion solution
needed for the appropriate dose of Recarbrio as shown in the table below.
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration
prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard if discoloration or visible
particles are observed.

Compatible medicinal products
The physical compatibility of Recarbrio with selected injectable medicinal products was evaluated in
two commonly available diluents at a Y-infusion site. Compatible medicinal products with the
corresponding compatible diluent (i.e., 5 % Dextrose Injection or 0.9 % Sodium chloride Injection) are
listed below. Recarbrio should not be co-administered through the same intravenous line (or cannula),
with other medicinal products not listed below, as no compatibility data are available. Refer to the
respective prescribing information of the co-administered medicinal product(s) to confirm
compatibility of simultaneous co-administration. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other
medicinal products except those mentioned below.

Injection as Diluents
  dexmedetomidine
  dopamine
  epinephrine
  fentanyl
  heparin
  midazolam
  norepinephrine
  phenylephrine
Compatible intravenous bags and infusion set materials
Recarbrio is compatible with the following intravenous container bags and infusion set materials. Any
intravenous bags or infusion set materials not listed below should not be used.
Intravenous Container Bag Materials
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefin (polypropylene and polyethylene)
Intravenous Infusion Set Materials (with tubing)
PVC + Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and polyethylene (PE)-lined PVC
Incompatible medicinal products
Recarbrio for solution for infusion is physically incompatible with propofol in 5 % Dextrose (also
named Glucose) or 0.9 % Sodium chloride.
After constitution and dilution
Diluted solutions should be used immediately. The time interval between the beginning of
reconstitution and the end of intravenous infusion should not exceed two hours. </p>         </div>"""
