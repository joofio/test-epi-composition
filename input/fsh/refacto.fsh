If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using ReFacto AF
-
if you experience allergic reactions. Some of the signs of allergic reactions are difficulty in 
breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, and low 
blood pressure. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing 
and/or breathing, red or swollen face and/or hands. If any of these signs occur, stop the infusion 
immediately and contact a doctor or seek immediate emergency care. In case of severe allergic 
reactions, alternative therapy must be considered.
-
the formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment 
with all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment 
working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these 
inhibitors. If your or your child s bleeding is not being controlled with ReFacto AF, tell your 
doctor immediately.
-
if your bleeding does not stop as expected and contact your doctor or seek immediate emergency 
care.
Other medicines and ReFacto AF
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
ReFacto AF has no influence on the ability to drive or use machines.
ReFacto AF contains sodium 
After reconstitution, ReFacto AF contains 1.27 mmol (or 29 mg) sodium (main component of 
cooking/table salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary 
intake of sodium for an adult. Depending on your body weight and your dose of ReFacto AF, you 
could receive multiple vials. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a low salt diet.</p>         </div>"""

Treatment with ReFacto AF should be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients 
with haemophilia A. Your doctor will decide the dose of ReFacto AF you will receive. This dose and 
duration will depend upon your individual needs for replacement factor VIII therapy. ReFacto AF is 
given by injection into a vein lasting several minutes. Patients or their carers can give injections of 
ReFacto AF, provided that they have been trained appropriately.
During your treatment, your doctor may decide to change the dose of ReFacto AF you receive.
Consult with your health care provider before you travel. You should bring enough of your factor VIII 
product for anticipated treatment when travelling. 
It is recommended that every time you use ReFacto AF, you record the name on the carton and batch 
number of the product. You can use one of the peel-off labels found on the vial to document the batch 
number in your diary or for reporting any side effects.
Reconstitution and administration
The procedures below are provided as guidelines for the reconstitution and administration of ReFacto
AF. Patients should follow the specific reconstitution and administration procedures provided by their 
doctors.
Use only the pre-filled syringe provided in the box for reconstitution. Other sterile disposable syringes 
may be used for administration.
ReFacto AF is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder 
for injection with the supplied solvent [sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution] syringe. ReFacto AF 
should not be mixed with other infusion solutions.
Always wash your hands before performing the following reconstitution and administration 
procedures. Aseptic technique (meaning clean and germ-free) should be used during the reconstitution 
procedure.
Reconstitution:
1. Allow the vial of lyophilised ReFacto AF and the pre-filled solvent syringe to reach room 
temperature.
2. Remove the plastic flip-top cap from the ReFacto AF vial to expose the central portion of the 
rubber stopper.
3. Wipe the top of the vial with the alcohol swab provided, or use another antiseptic solution and 
allow to dry. After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper with your hand or allow it to touch 
any surface.
4. Peel back the lid from the clear plastic vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from the 
package. 
5. Place the vial on a flat surface. While holding the adapter package, place the vial adapter over 
the vial. Press down firmly on the package until the adapter snaps into place on top of the vial, 
with the adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper. 
6. Lift the package away from the adapter and discard the package.</p>         </div>"""
