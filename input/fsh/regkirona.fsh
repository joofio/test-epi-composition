who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. This medicine stops the virus from entering human cells by binding to the spike protein of 
SARS-CoV-2. When it attaches to the spike protein, the interaction between the virus and the cellular 
receptor is blocked and the ability of the virus to enter the body s cells is reduced. This can help your 
body to resist the virus infection, and may help to prevent the disease from getting worse. </p>         </div>"""
