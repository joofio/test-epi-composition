non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) that are used for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.
REKAMBYS works together with other HIV medicines to block the ability of the virus to make more 
copies of itself. REKAMBYS injections do not cure HIV infection but help reduce the amount of HIV 
in your body and keeps it at a low level. This holds off damage to the immune system and the 
development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
REKAMBYS is always given with another HIV medicine called cabotegravir injection. They are used
together in adults aged 18 years and older whose HIV-1 infection is already under control.</p>         </div>"""

medicine (listed in section 6).
Do not use REKAMBYS if you are taking any of the following medicines as they may affect the 
way REKAMBYS or the other medicine works:
-
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures)
-
rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as 
tuberculosis)
-
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and 
allergic reactions) as a course of treatment by mouth or injection
-
products that contain St John s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for 
depression).
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using REKAMBYS.
REKAMBYS is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment to reduce the amount of virus in 
the blood.
Tell your doctor about your situation
Check the following points and tell your doctor if any of them apply to you.
-
You must attend all the planned visits for injections, do not miss any visits, it is very important 
for the success of your treatment. If you cannot attend a planned visit, inform your doctor as 
soon as possible.
-
Tell your doctor if you have ever had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B or
hepatitis C, or problems with your kidneys. Your doctor may check how well your liver or 
kidneys work to decide if you can use REKAMBYS. See  Uncommon side effects  in section 4 
of this leaflet for signs of liver damage.
-
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections (for example, fever, 
chills, sweats). In some patients with HIV, inflammation from previous infections may occur 
soon after starting HIV treatment. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement 
in the body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that were present 
previously but caused no obvious symptoms.
-
Also tell your doctor straight away if you notice any symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, 
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity. This is because autoimmune disorders (conditions in 
which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur 
many months after the start of treatment.
-
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that you have been told may cause a 
life-threatening irregular heartbeat (torsade de pointes).
Reactions to Injections
Post-injection reaction symptoms have happened within minutes in some people after receiving their 
rilpivirine injection. Most symptoms resolved within a few minutes after the injection. Symptoms of 
post-injection reactions may include: difficulty breathing, stomach cramps, rash, sweating, numbness 
of your mouth, feeling anxious, feeling warm, feeling lightheaded or feeling like you are going to pass 
out (faint), blood pressure changes, and pain (e.g., back and chest). Tell your healthcare professional if 
you experience these symptoms after you receive your injections.
Regular appointments are important
It is important that you attend your planned appointments to receive REKAMBYS, to control your 
HIV infection and to stop your illness from getting worse. Do not miss any visits, it is very important 
for the success of your treatment. If you cannot attend a planned visit, inform your doctor as soon as 
possible. Talk to your doctor if you are thinking about stopping treatment. If you are late receiving 
your REKAMBYS injection, or if you stop receiving REKAMBYS, you will need to take other 
medicines to treat HIV infection and to reduce the risk of the virus becoming resistant as the drug 
levels in your body will be too low to treat the HIV infection.
Children
REKAMBYS is not for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, because it has not 
been studied in these patients.
Other medicines and REKAMBYS
Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Some medicines may affect the levels of REKAMBYS in the blood if you are taking them while being 
treated with REKAMBYS, or REKAMBYS may affect how well the other medicine works.
REKAMBYS must not be given with some other medicines (see  Do not use REKAMBYS  in 
section 2).
The effects of REKAMBYS or other medicines might change if you use REKAMBYS together 
with any of the following medicines:
-
clarithromycin, erythromycin (antibiotics)
-
methadone (used to treat narcotic withdrawal and dependence)
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. Your doctor will 
consider the benefit and the risk to you and your baby of using REKAMBYS while you are pregnant. 
If you are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor in advance, as rilpivirine can remain in your 
body for up to 4 years after the last injection of REKAMBYS.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Some patients may feel tired, dizzy or drowsy during treatment with REKAMBYS. Do not drive or 
operate machinery if you have any of these side effects.
Important information about some of the ingredients of REKAMBYS
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2 mL injection, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>A nurse or doctor will give you REKAMBYS as an injection in the muscle of your buttock 
(intramuscular, or IM injection).
You will be given your injection either once every month or once every 2 months, together with 
another injectable medicine called cabotegravir. Your doctor will explain how often the medicine will 
be given.
When you start treatment with REKAMBYS, you and your doctor may decide to start with daily 
treatment of one 25 mg rilpivirine tablet with a meal and one 30 mg cabotegravir tablet for one month
before your first REKAMBYS injection. This is called the lead-in period - taking the tablets before 
you receive REKAMBYS and cabotegravir injections will allow your doctor to test how well these 
medicines suit you.
The other option is that you and your doctor may decide to start directly with REKAMBYS injections.
If you are going to be given REKAMBYS every month, your treatment will be as follows:
When
Medicine
First injection
Second injection onwards, every month
Rilpivirine
single injection of 900 mg 
600 mg by injection every month 
Cabotegravir
single injection of 600 mg
400 mg by injection every month
If you are going to be given REKAMBYS every 2 months, your treatment will be as follows:
When
Medicine
First and second injections, one 
month apart
Third injection onwards, every two 
months
Rilpivirine
single injection of 900 mg 
900 mg by injection, every 2 months
Cabotegravir
single injection of 600 mg 
600 mg by injection, every 2 months
If you miss a REKAMBYS injection
It is important that you keep your regular planned appointments to receive your injection. If you miss 
an appointment, contact your doctor immediately to make a new appointment.
Talk to your doctor if you think you will not be able to receive your REKAMBYS injection at the 
usual time. Your doctor may recommend you take tablets instead, until you are able to have a 
REKAMBYS injection again.
If you are given too much REKAMBYS
A doctor or nurse will give this medicine to you, so it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If 
you are worried, tell the doctor or nurse.
Don t stop using REKAMBYS without advice from your doctor.
Use REKAMBYS for as long as your doctor recommends. Don t stop unless your doctor advises you 
to.
Low levels of rilpivirine (the active ingredient of REKAMBYS) can remain in your body for up to 
4 years after stopping treatment. However, once you received your last REKAMBYS injection, the 
low levels of rilpivirine that remain will not work well enough against the virus which then can 
become resistant. To keep your HIV-1 infection under control and to stop the virus becoming resistant, 
you must start a different HIV treatment by the time your next REKAMBYS injection was planned.</p>         </div>"""
