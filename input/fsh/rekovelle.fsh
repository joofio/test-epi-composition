<p>REKOVELLE is used in the treatment of female infertility and in women undergoing assisted 
reproduction programmes such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection 
(ICSI). REKOVELLE stimulates the ovaries to grow and develop many egg sacs ( follicles ), from 
which eggs are collected and fertilised in the laboratory. </p>         </div>"""

causes of your fertility problems. </p>
<p>Do not use REKOVELLE 
* if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6) 
* if you have a tumour of the uterus, ovaries, breasts, pituitary gland or hypothalamus 
* if you have enlarged ovaries or cysts on your ovaries (unless caused by polycystic ovarian 
disease) 
* if you suffer from bleeding from the vagina without any known cause 
* if you have had an early menopause 
* if you have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible 
* if you have fibroids of the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using REKOVELLE. </p>
<p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
Gonadotropins like this medicine may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is when your 
follicles develop too much and become large cysts. 
Talk to your doctor if you: 
* have abdominal pain, discomfort or swelling 
* have nausea<br />
<em> are vomiting<br />
</em> get diarrhoea 
* gain weight<br />
* have difficulty in breathing 
Your doctor may ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
If the recommended dose and schedule of administration are followed, ovarian hyperstimulation 
syndrome is less likely. </p>
<p>Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Clots in the blood vessels (veins or arteries) are more likely in women who are pregnant. Infertility 
treatment can increase the risk of this happening, especially if you are overweight or you or someone 
in your family (blood relative) have a known blood clotting disease (thrombophilia). Tell your doctor 
if you think this applies to you. </p>
<p>Twisting of ovaries 
There have been reports of twisting of ovaries (ovarian torsion) following assisted reproductive 
technology treatment. Twisting of the ovary could cut off the blood flow to the ovary. </p>
<p>Multiple pregnancy and birth defects 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment the possibility of having a multiple 
pregnancy (such as twins) is mainly related to the number of embryos placed inside your womb, the 
quality of the embryos, and your age. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you 
and your babies. Furthermore, the risk of birth defects may be slightly higher following infertility 
treatment, which is thought to be due to characteristics of the parents (such as your age, and your 
partner s sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy loss 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a 
miscarriage than if you conceive naturally. </p>
<p>Pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment, you are more likely to have a pregnancy 
outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) than if you conceive naturally. If you have a history of tubal 
disease, you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. </p>
<p>Ovarian and other reproductive system tumours 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who had 
undergone infertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increase the risk of 
these tumours in infertile women. </p>
<p>Other medical conditions 
Before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if:<br />
* you have been told by another doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you 
* you have kidney or liver disease </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) 
This medicine is not indicated in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and REKOVELLE 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>REKOVELLE contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

Check with your doctor if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The REKOVELLE dose for your first treatment cycle will be calculated by your doctor using the level 
of anti-M llerian hormone (AMH, a marker of how your ovaries will respond to stimulation with 
gonadotropins) in your blood and your body weight. Therefore the AMH result from a blood sample 
(taken within the last 12 months) should be available before you start treatment. Your body weight 
will also be measured before you start treatment. The REKOVELLE dose is stated in micrograms. </p>
<p>The REKOVELLE dose is fixed for the whole treatment period with no adjustments to increase or 
decrease your daily dose. Your doctor will monitor the effect of REKOVELLE treatment, and 
treatment is stopped when an appropriate number of egg sacs are present. In general, you will be given 
a single injection of a medicine called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at a dose of 
250 micrograms or 5,000 IU for final development of the follicles. </p>
<p>If your body s response to treatment is too weak or too strong, your doctor may decide to stop 
treatment with REKOVELLE. For the next treatment cycle, your doctor will in this case give you 
either a higher or a lower daily dose of REKOVELLE than before. </p>
<p>How are injections given 
The instructions for using the pre-filled pen must be followed carefully. Do not use the pre-filled pen 
if the solution contains particles or if the solution does not look clear. </p>
<p>The first injection of this medicine should be given under the supervision of a doctor or a nurse. Your 
doctor will decide if you can give yourself further doses of this medicine at home, but only after 
receiving adequate training. </p>
<p>This medicine is to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously) usually in the abdomen. 
The pre-filled pen may be used for several injections. </p>
<p>If you use more REKOVELLE than you should 
The effects of taking too much of this medicine are unknown. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
may possibly occur, which is described in section 4. If you forget to use REKOVELLE 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please contact your doctor as soon as you 
notice that you forgot a dose. </p>
