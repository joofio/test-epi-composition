  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Remicade contains the active substance infliximab. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody   a type of 
protein that attaches to a specific target in the body called TNF (tumour necrosis factor) alpha.
Remicade belongs to a group of medicines called  TNF blockers . It is used in adults for the following 
inflammatory diseases:</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis</p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew s disease)</p>
<p>Psoriasis.
Remicade is also used in adults and children 6 years of age or older for:</p>
<p>Crohn s disease</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis.
Remicade works by selectively attaching to TNF alpha and blocking its action. TNF alpha is involved 
in inflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. If you have active rheumatoid arthritis 
you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given 
Remicade which you will take in combination with another medicine called methotrexate to:</p>
<p>Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease</p>
<p>Slow down the damage in your joints</p>
<p>Improve your physical function.
Psoriatic arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you 
have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work 
well enough, you will be given Remicade to:</p>
<p>Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease</p>
<p>Slow down the damage in your joints</p>
<p>Improve your physical function.
Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew s disease)
Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine. If you have ankylosing spondylitis 
you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given 
Remicade to:</p>
<p>Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease</p>
<p>Improve your physical function.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, you 
will first be given other medicines or treatments, such as phototherapy. If these medicines or 
treatments do not work well enough, you will be given Remicade to reduce the signs and symptoms of 
your disease.
Ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first 
be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remicade to 
treat your disease.
Crohn s disease
Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn s disease you will first be 
given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remicade to:</p>
<p>Treat active Crohn s disease</p>
<p>Reduce the number of abnormal openings (fistulae) between your bowel and your skin that have 
not been controlled by other medicines or surgery.</p>         </div>"""

<p>You are allergic to infliximab or to any of the other ingredients in Remicade (listed in 
section 6).</p>
<p>You are allergic (hypersensitive) to proteins that come from mice.</p>
<p>You have tuberculosis (TB) or another serious infection such as pneumonia or sepsis.</p>
<p>You have heart failure that is moderate or severe.
Do not use Remicade if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
you are given Remicade.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before or during treatment with Remicade if you have:
Had treatment with Remicade before</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have had treatment with Remicade in the past and are now starting 
Remicade treatment again.
If you have had a break in your Remicade treatment of more than 16 weeks, there is a higher 
risk for allergic reactions when you start the treatment again.
Infections</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have an infection even if it is a 
very minor one.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have ever lived in or travelled to 
an area where infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are 
common. These infections are caused by specific types of fungi that can affect the lungs 
or other parts of your body.</p>
<p>You may get infections more easily when you are being treated with Remicade. If you are 
65 or older, you have a greater risk.</p>
<p>These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, 
fungi, bacteria, or other organisms in the environment and sepsis that may be
life-threatening.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of infection during treatment with Remicade. 
Signs include fever, cough, flu-like signs, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, wounds or dental 
problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Remicade.
Tuberculosis (TB)</p>
<p>It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had TB or if you have been 
in close contact with someone who has had or has TB.</p>
<p>Your doctor will test you to see if you have TB. Cases of TB have been reported in 
patients treated with Remicade, even in patients who have already been treated with 
medicines for TB. Your doctor will record these tests on your patient reminder card.</p>
<p>If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicines for TB 
before you are given Remicade.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of TB during treatment with Remicade. Signs 
include persistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats.
Hepatitis B virus</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you are a carrier of hepatitis B or have 
ever had it.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B.</p>
<p>Your doctor should test you for hepatitis B virus.</p>
<p>Treatment with TNF blockers such as Remicade may result in reactivation of hepatitis B 
virus in patients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases.
Heart problems</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure.</p>
<p>Your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during 
treatment with Remicade. Signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet.
Cancer and lymphoma</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have or have ever had lymphoma 
(a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer.</p>
<p>Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may 
be at higher risk of developing lymphoma.</p>
<p>Children and adults taking Remicade may have an increased risk of developing 
lymphoma or another cancer.</p>
<p>Some patients who have received TNF-blockers, including Remicade have developed a 
rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Of these patients, most were 
teenage boys or young men and most had either Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis. This 
type of cancer has usually resulted in death. Almost all patients had also received 
medicines containing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in addition to TNF-blockers.</p>
<p>Some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. If 
there are any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your 
doctor.</p>
<p>Some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with Remicade have developed 
cervical cancer. For women taking Remicade including those over 60 years of age, your 
doctor may recommend regular screening for cervical cancer.
Lung disease or heavy smoking</p>
<p>Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have a lung disease called Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or if you are a heavy smoker.</p>
<p>Patients with COPD and patients who are heavy smokers may have a higher risk of 
developing cancer with Remicade treatment.
Nervous system disease</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a problem that affects your nervous system 
before you are given Remicade. This includes multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre 
syndrome, if you have fits or have been diagnosed with  optic neuritis .
Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of a nerve disease during treatment with 
Remicade. Signs include changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs, numbness or 
tingling in any part of your body.
Abnormal skin openings</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have any abnormal skin openings (fistulae) before you are given 
Remicade.
Vaccinations</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you recently have had or are due to have a vaccine.</p>
<p>You should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Remicade treatment. You 
may receive some vaccines during treatment with Remicade but you should not receive 
live vaccines (vaccines that contain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using 
Remicade because they may cause infections.</p>
<p>If you received Remicade while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk
for getting an infection as a result of receiving a live vaccine during the first year of life. 
It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other healthcare professionals about 
your Remicade use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine, 
including live vaccines such as the BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis).</p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, it is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other 
healthcare professionals about your Remicade use before your baby is given any vaccine. 
For more information see section on Pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Therapeutic infectious agents</p>
<p>Talk to you doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment 
with a therapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used for the treatment of 
cancer).
Operations or dental procedures</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures.</p>
<p>Tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with Remicade by showing 
them your patient reminder card.
Liver problems</p>
<p>Some patients receiving Remicade have developed serious liver problems.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with 
Remicade. Signs include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark-brown coloured urine, pain or 
swelling in the upper right side of the stomach area, joint pain, skin rashes, or fever.
Low blood counts</p>
<p>In some patients receiving Remicade, the body may not make enough of the blood cells 
that help fight infections or help stop bleeding.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of low blood counts during treatment with 
Remicade. Signs include persistent fever, bleeding or bruising more easily, small red or purple spots 
caused by bleeding under the skin, or looking pale.
Immune system disorder</p>
<p>Some patients receiving Remicade have developed symptoms of an immune system 
disorder called lupus.
Tell your doctor straight away if you develop symptoms of lupus during treatment with 
Remicade. Signs include joint pain or a rash on cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.
Children and adolescents
The information above also applies to children and adolescents. In addition:</p>
<p>Some children and teenage patients who have received TNF-blockers such as Remicade 
have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death.</p>
<p>More children taking Remicade developed infections as compared to adults.</p>
<p>Children should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Remicade treatment. 
Children may receive some vaccines during treatment with Remicade but should not 
receive live vaccines while using Remicade.
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before you are given 
Remicade.
Other medicines and Remicade
Patients who have inflammatory diseases already take medicines to treat their problem. These 
medicines may cause side effects. Your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep 
using while you are having Remicade.
Tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, including any other 
medicines to treat Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, 
psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins and 
herbal medicines.
In particular, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following medicines:</p>
<p>Medicines that affect your immune system.</p>
<p>Kineret (anakinra). Remicade and Kineret should not be used together.</p>
<p>Orencia (abatacept). Remicade and Orencia should not be used together.
While using Remicade you should not receive live vaccines. If you were using Remicade during 
pregnancy or if you are receiving Remicade while breast-feeding, tell your baby s doctor and other 
healthcare professionals caring for your baby about your Remicade use before the baby receives any 
vaccines.
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Remicade.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility</p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Remicade should only be used during 
pregnancy or while breast-feeding if your doctor feels it is necessary for you.</p>
<p>You should avoid getting pregnant when you are being treated with Remicade and for 6 months 
after you stop being treated with it. Discuss the use of contraception during this time with your 
doctor.</p>
<p>If you received Remicade during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting 
an infection.</p>
<p>It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other healthcare professionals about your 
Remicade use before your baby is given any vaccine. If you received Remicade while pregnant, 
giving BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) to your baby within 12 months after birth 
may result in infection with serious complications, including death. Live vaccines such as the 
BCG vaccine should not be given to your baby within 12 months after birth, unless your baby s 
doctor recommends otherwise. For more information see section on vaccination.</p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, it is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other healthcare 
professionals about your Remicade use before your baby is given any vaccine. Live vaccines 
should not be given to your baby while you are breast-feeding unless your baby s doctor 
recommends otherwise.</p>
<p>Severely decreased numbers of white blood cells have been reported in infants born to women 
treated with Remicade during pregnancy. If your baby has continual fevers or infections, contact 
your baby s doctor immediately.
Driving and using machines
Remicade is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel tired, dizzy,
or unwell after having Remicade, do not drive or use any tools or machines.
Remicade contains sodium
Remicade contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . 
However, before Remicade is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that contains sodium. Talk to 
your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.</p>         </div>"""
