  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Renvela contains sevelamer carbonate as the active substance. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive 
tract and so reduces serum phosphorus levels in the blood. </p>
<p>This medicine is used to control hyperphosphataemia (high blood phosphate levels) in: 
* adult patients on dialysis (a blood clearance technique). It can be used in patients undergoing 
haemodialysis (using a blood filtration machine) or peritoneal dialysis (where fluid is pumped into the 
abdomen and an internal body membrane filters the blood); 
* patients with chronic (long-term) kidney disease who are not on dialysis and have a serum (blood) 
phosphorus level equal to or above 1.78 mmol/l. </p>
<p>This medicine should be used with other treatments such as calcium supplements and vitamin D to prevent 
the development of bone disease. 
Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to hard deposits in your body called calcification. These 
deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and make it harder for blood to be pumped around the body. 
Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. </p>         </div>"""

* you are allergic to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you) 
* you have bowel obstruction  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Renvela if any of the following applies to you: 
  swallowing problems. Your doctor can rather prescribe Renvela powder for oral suspension 
  problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel 
  being sick frequently 
  active inflammation of the bowel 
  have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel 
Talk to your doctor while taking Renvela: 
* if you experience severe abdominal pain, stomach or intestine disorders, or blood in the stool 
(gastrointestinal bleeding). These symptoms can be due to serious inflammatory bowel disease 
caused by sevelamer crystals deposit in your bowel. Contact your doctor who will decide on 
continuing the treatment or not. </p>
<p>Additional treatments 
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: 
  develop low or high levels of calcium in your blood. Since this medicine does not contain calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
  have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels of 
vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your 
blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental vitamins as 
necessary. 
  have disturbed level of bicarbonate in your blood and increased acidity in the blood and other body 
tissue. Your doctor should monitor the level of bicarbonate in your blood. </p>
<p>Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis. 
This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You should tell your 
doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, 
abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  </p>
<p>Children 
The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 6 years) have not been studied. Therefore this medicine 
is not recommended for use in children below the age of 6 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Renvela 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Renvela should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). </p>
<p>If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor 
when taking Renvela. </p>
<p>The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (medicines used 
to suppress the immune system) may be reduced by Renvela. Your doctor will advise you if you are 
taking these medicines. </p>
<p>Thyroid hormone deficiency may uncommonly be observed in certain people taking levothyroxine 
(used to treat low thyroid hormone levels) and Renvela. Therefore your doctor may monitor the levels 
of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood more closely. </p>
<p>Medicines treating heartburn and reflux from your stomach or oesophagus, such as omeprazole, 
pantoprazole, or lansoprazole, known as  proton pump inhibitors , may reduce the efficacy of 
Renvela.  Your doctor may monitor the phosphate level in your blood. </p>
<p>Your doctor will check for interactions between Renvela and other medicines on a regular basis. </p>
<p>In some cases where Renvela should be taken at the same time as another medicine. Your doctor may advise 
you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renvela intake. Your doctor may also consider 
monitoring the levels of that medicine in your blood. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before taking this medicine.<br />
The potential risk of Renvela during human pregnancy is unknown. Talk to your doctor who will decide if 
you can continue the treatment with Renvela. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether Renvela is excreted in breast milk and may affect your baby. Talk to your doctor who 
will decide if you can breastfeed your baby or not, and if it is necessary to stop Renvela treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Renvela is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>

<p>If you stop taking Renvela 
Taking your Renvela treatment is important to maintain an appropriate phosphate level in your blood.

consider stopping your Renvela treatment, contact your doctor or pharmacist first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
