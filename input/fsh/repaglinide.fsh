pancreas produce more insulin and thereby lower your blood sugar (glucose). </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the 
sugar in your blood or where your body does not respond normally to the insulin it produces. </p>
<p>Repaglinide Accord is used to control type 2 diabetes in adults as an add-on to diet and exercise: 
treatment is usually started if diet, exercise and weight reduction alone have not been able to control 
(or lower) your blood sugar. Repaglinide Accord can also be given with metformin, another medicine 
for diabetes. </p>
<p>Repaglinide Accord has been shown to lower the blood sugar, which helps to prevent complications 
from your diabetes. </p>         </div>"""
