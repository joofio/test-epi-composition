This medicine contains the active substance human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, which is a normal 
component of the blood and is found in the lung. There, its main function is to protect the lung tissue
by limiting the action of a certain enzyme, called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase can cause 
damage if its action is not controlled (for example, in case you have an alpha1-proteinase inhibitor 
deficiency).
What Respreeza is used for
This medicine is used in adults with known severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (an inherited 
condition also called alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency) who have developed a lung condition called
emphysema.
Emphysema develops when the lack of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor results in a condition in which
neutrophil elastase is not being properly controlled, damaging the tiny air sacs in the lungs through 
which oxygen passes into the body. Because of this damage, the lungs do not work properly.
Using this medicine regularly increases the blood and lung levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, thus 
slowing the progression of emphysema.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you have been found to have a deficiency of certain blood proteins called immunoglobulin 
type A (IgA) and have developed antibodies against them.
Warnings and precautions</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Respreeza.
Information on allergic reactions: when slowing or stopping the infusion may be required?
You may be allergic to human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor even if you have previously received human 
alpha1-proteinase inhibitors and had tolerated them well. In some cases, severe allergic reactions may 
occur. Your doctor will inform you about signs of allergic reactions (for example chills, flushing, 
faster heartbeat, fall in blood pressure, light-headedness, rash, hives, itching, difficulty in breathing or 
swallowing as well as swelling of your hands, face, or mouth) (see also section 4).</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice such reactions during the 
infusion of this medicine. Depending on the nature and severity of the reaction, your doctor may 
decide whether to slow or stop the infusion completely and start the appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>In case of self-administration / home-treatment, stop the infusion immediately and contact your 
doctor or healthcare professional.
Information on safety with respect to infections
Respreeza is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood with the blood cells 
removed).
Because blood can carry infections, when medicines are made from human blood or plasma certain 
measures are put in place to prevent these from being present in the medicine and passed on to 
patients. These include:</p>
<p>careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded,</p>
<p>the testing of samples of donated blood and plasma to try to avoid use of material with signs of 
virus/infections,</p>
<p>the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove 
viruses.
The measures taken are considered effective for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and parvovirus B19 virus.
However, despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are 
administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to 
any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.
Your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you 
regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived proteinase inhibitors.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Respreeza the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used.
Smoking
Since tobacco smoke is an important risk factor for the development and progression of emphysema, 
you are strongly advised to stop smoking and avoid passive smoking.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Respreeza</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take 
any other medicines.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility</p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or healthcare professional for advice before taking this medicine.
Since alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal component of human blood, recommended dose of this 
medicine is not expected to cause harm to the developing foetus. However, as there is no information 
available regarding the safety of Respreeza use during pregnancy, if you are pregnant, this medicine 
should only be given to you with caution.
It is unknown whether Respreeza passes into human milk. If you are breast-feeding, your doctor will 
discuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.
There are no data concerning the effect on fertility but as alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal 
component of human blood, no adverse effects on fertility are expected if you use Respreeza at the 
recommended dose.
Driving and using machines
Dizziness may occur after the administration of this medicine. If you experience dizziness, you should 
not drive or use machines until the dizziness has passed (see section 4).
Respreeza contains sodium
This medicinal product contains approximately 37 mg sodium per 1,000 mg Respreeza vial, 149 mg 
sodium per 4,000 mg Respreeza vial and 186 mg sodium per 5,000 mg Respreeza vial, equivalent to 
1.9%, 7.4% and 9.3% respectively, of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium 
for an adult. Your doctor or healthcare professional will take that into consideration if you are on a 
controlled sodium diet.</p>         </div>"""

Home treatment / Self-administration
After the first infusions, you or your caregiver might also administer Respreeza, but only after 
receiving adequate training. If your doctor decides that you are suitable for such home-treatment / self-
administration, he or she will instruct you in:</p>
<p>how to prepare and give this medicine (see the illustrated instructions at the end of this leaflet in 
 Information for health-care professionals and for patients suitable for home-treatment / self-
administration ),</p>
<p>how to keep the product sterile (aseptic infusion techniques),</p>
<p>how to keep a treatment diary,</p>
<p>how to identify side effects, including signs of allergic reactions, and measures to be taken in 
case such effects occur (see also section 2 and section 4).
Your doctor or your healthcare professional will regularly review your / your caregiver s infusion 
technique to ensure continued appropriate handling.
Dose
The amount of Respreeza you are given is based on your body weight. The recommended dose is 
60 mg per kg of body weight and should be administered once per week. The infusion solution is 
normally given over about 15 minutes (about 0.08 ml of solution per kg body weight each min). Your 
doctor will determine the appropriate infusion rate for you by taking into account your weight and 
your tolerability to infusion.
If you use more Respreeza than you should
Consequences of an overdose are unknown.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you think you have used more Respreeza as you 
should. He or she will take the appropriate measures.
If you forget to use Respreeza</p>
<p>Proceed with your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your 
doctor or healthcare professional.</p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Respreeza</p>
<p>Do no stop using this medicine without consulting your doctor or healthcare professional. If 
treatment with Respreeza is stopped, your condition may worsen.</p>         </div>"""
