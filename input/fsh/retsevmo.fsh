  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Retsevmo is an anticancer medicine containing the active substance selpercatinib.  </p>
<p>It is used to treat either of the following cancers which are caused by certain abnormal changes in the 
RET gene and which have spread and/or cannot be removed by surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li>A type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer, in adults who have not previously been 
treated with a RET inhibitor medicine.  </li>
<li>Thyroid cancer (any type) in adults if prior therapies have failed to control your cancer.  </li>
<li>A rare type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid cancer in adults and adolescents 12 years 
and older.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will perform a test to check if your cancer has a change in the RET gene to make sure that 
Retsevmo is right for you. </p>
<p>How Retsevmo works 
In patients whose cancer has an altered RET gene, the change in the gene causes the body to make an 
abnormal RET protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. Retsevmo blocks the 
action of the abnormal RET protein and so may slow or stop the growth of the cancer. It may also help 
to shrink the cancer.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Retsevmo works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Retsevmo:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have lung or breathing problems other than lung cancer. </li>
<li>If you have high blood pressure. </li>
<li>If you have been told that you have an abnormality of your heart tracing after an 
electrocardiogram (ECG) known as prolonged QT interval.  </li>
<li>If you have problems with your thyroid or levels of thyroid hormone.  </li>
<li>Retsevmo may affect fertility in females and males, which may affect your ability to have 
children. Talk to your doctor if this is a concern for you. </li>
<li>If you have a recent history of significant bleeding. </li>
</ul>
<p>Retsevmo may cause hypersensitivity reactions such as fever, rash and pain. If you experience any of 
these reactions, talk to your doctor. After checking your symptoms, your doctor may ask you to take 
corticosteroids until your symptoms are better. </p>
<p>A fast breakdown of cancer cells (tumour lysis syndrome, TLS) can occur when you are taking 
Retsevmo. This can cause irregular heartbeat, kidney failure or abnormal blood test results. Talk to 
your doctor if you have a history of kidney problems or low blood pressure, because this may increase 
the risks associated with TLS. </p>
<p>See section 4,  Possible side effects , and talk to your doctor if you have any symptoms.  </p>
<p>What your doctor will check before and during your treatment 
- Retsevmo may cause severe, life-threatening, or fatal inflammation of the lungs. Your doctor 
will monitor you before and during treatment with Retsevmo for symptoms. Tell your doctor 
right away if you notice any symptoms of lung problems including breathlessness, cough and 
raised temperature.<br />
- Retsevmo may affect your blood pressure. You will have your blood pressure measured before 
and during treatment with Retsevmo.<br />
- Retsevmo may affect the way your liver works. Tell your doctor right away if you develop 
symptoms of liver problems including: jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes), loss 
of appetite, nausea or vomiting, or pain on the upper right side of your stomach area. 
- Retsevmo may result in abnormal ECGs. You will have an ECG taken before and during your 
treatment with Retsevmo. Tell your doctor if you experience fainting as it may be a symptom of 
abnormal ECG.<br />
- Retsevmo may affect how your thyroid works. Your doctor will monitor your thyroid function 
before and during treatment with Retsevmo. 
- You will have regular blood tests before and during treatment with Retsevmo, to check your 
liver function and electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium) in your 
blood.<br />
- If you are 12-18 years of age, your doctor may monitor your growth during treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Retsevmo is not intended for use in patients less than 18 years of age in lung or thyroid cancer other 
than medullary thyroid cancer. 
The medullary thyroid cancer indication does not cover children younger than 12 years of age.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Retsevmo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Retsevmo if you are taking the following:</p>
<ul>

are taking any of these medicines, then you need to take them 2 hours after taking 
Retsevmo </li>

</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor before 
taking this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not use Retsevmo during pregnancy, since the effect of Retsevmo on the unborn is not 
known.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Retsevmo as Retsevmo could harm a breast-fed baby. It is 
not known if Retsevmo passes into breast milk. You should not breast-feed for at least one week after 
your last dose of Retsevmo. </p>
<p>Contraception 
It is recommended that women avoid becoming pregnant and that men do not father children during 
treatment with Retsevmo, because this medicine could harm the baby. If there is any possibility that 
the person taking this medicine may become pregnant or father a child, they must use adequate 
contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose of Retsevmo. </p>
<p>Fertility<br />
Retsevmo can affect your ability to have children. Talk to your doctor to seek advice about fertility 
preservation prior to treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
You should take special care when driving and using machines as you may feel tired or dizzy while 
taking Retsevmo. </p>         </div>"""
