<ul>
<li>
<p>if you are allergic to sildenafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are taking medicines containing nitrates, or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrate 
( poppers ). These medicines are often given for relief of chest pain (or  angina pectoris ). 
Revatio can cause a serious increase in the effects of these medicines. Tell your doctor if you are 
taking any of these medicines. If you are not certain, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are taking riociguat. This drug is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high 
blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Revatio have 
been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or 
are unsure tell your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have recently had a stroke, a heart attack or if you have severe liver disease or very low 
blood pressure (&lt;90/50 mmHg). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are taking a medicine to treat fungal infections such as ketoconazole or itraconazole or 
medicines containing ritonavir (for HIV). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have ever had loss of vision because of a problem with blood flow to the nerve in the eye 
called non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Revatio if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a disease due to a blocked or narrow vein in the lungs rather than a blocked or 
narrow artery. </li>
<li>have a severe heart problem. </li>
<li>have a problem with the pumping chambers of your heart  </li>
<li>have high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs. </li>
<li>have low blood pressure at rest. </li>
<li>lose a large amount of body fluids (dehydration) which can occur when you sweat a lot or do 
not drink enough liquids. This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhoea. </li>
<li>have a rare inherited eye disease (retinitis pigmentosa). </li>
<li>have an abnormality of red blood cells (sickle cell anaemia), cancer of blood cells (leukaemia), 
cancer of bone marrow (multiple myeloma), or any disease or deformity of the penis.  </li>
<li>currently have a stomach ulcer, a bleeding disorder (such as haemophilia) or problems with 
nose bleeds. </li>
<li>take medicines for erectile dysfunction. </li>
</ul>
<p>When used to treat male erectile dysfunction (ED), the following visual side effects have been 
reported with PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil at an unknown frequency; partial, sudden, 
temporary, or permanent decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes. </p>
<p>If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking Revatio and contact your doctor 
immediately (see also section 4). </p>
<p>Prolonged and sometimes painful erections have been reported in men after taking sildenafil. If you 
have an erection, which lasts continuously for more than 4 hours, stop taking Revatio and contact 
your doctor immediately (see also section 4). </p>
<p>Special considerations for patients with kidney or liver problems 
You should tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems, as your dose may need to be 
adjusted. </p>
<p>Children 
Revatio should not be given to children below 1 year of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Revatio 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines containing nitrates, or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrate ( poppers ). 
These medicines are often given for relief of angina pectoris or  chest pain  (see section 2. Before you take Revatio) </li>
<li>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are already taking riociguat. </li>
<li>Therapies for pulmonary hypertension (e.g. bosentan, iloprost)  </li>
<li>Medicines containing St. John s Wort (herbal medicinal product), rifampicin (used to 
treat bacterial infections), carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital (used, among others, 
to treat epilepsy)  </li>
<li>Blood thinning medicines (for example warfarin) although these did not result in any side 
effect. </li>
<li>
<p>Medicines containing erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin (these are antibiotics 
used to treat certain bacterial infections), saquinavir (for HIV) or nefazodone (for mental 
depression), as your dose may need to be adjusted. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alpha-blocker therapy (e.g. doxazosin) for the treatment of high blood pressure or 
prostate problems, as the combination of the two medicines may cause symptoms resulting in 
the lowering of your blood pressure (e.g. dizziness, light headedness). </p>
</li>
<li>Medicines containing sacubitril/valsartan, used to treat heart failure. </li>
</ul>
<p>Revatio with food and drink 
You should not drink grapefruit juice while you are being treated with Revatio. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Revatio should not be used during 
pregnancy unless strictly necessary. 
Revatio should not be given to women of child bearing potential unless using appropriate 
contraceptive methods. 
Revatio passes into your breast milk at very low levels and would not be expected to harm your baby.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Revatio can cause dizziness and can affect vision. You should be aware of how you react to the 
medicine before you drive or use machines.   </p>
<p>Revatio contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. </p>
<p>Revatio contains sodium 
Revatio 20 mg tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you forget to take Revatio 
If you forget to take Revatio, take a dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your 
medicine at the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
