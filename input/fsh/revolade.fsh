  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Revolade contains eltrombopag, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
thrombopoietin-receptor agonists. It is used to help increase the number of platelets in your blood. 
Platelets are blood cells that help to reduce or prevent bleeding. </p>
<ul>
<li>Revolade is used to treat a bleeding disorder called immune (primary) thrombocytopenia (ITP) 
in patients aged 1 year and above who have already taken other medicines (corticosteroids or 
immunoglobulins), which have not worked. </li>
</ul>
<p>ITP is caused by a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia). People with ITP have an 
increased risk of bleeding. Symptoms patients with ITP may notice include petechiae (pinpoint-
sized flat round red spots under the skin), bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums and not being 
able to control bleeding if they are cut or injured. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Revolade can also be used to treat low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) in adults with 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, if they have had problems with side effects while on 
interferon treatment. Many people with hepatitis C have low platelet counts, not only as a result 
of the disease, but also due to some of the antiviral medicines that are used to treat it. Taking 
Revolade may make it easier for you to complete a full course of antiviral medicine 
(peginterferon and ribavirin). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revolade may also be used to treat adult patients with low blood counts caused by severe 
aplastic anaemia (SAA). SAA is a disease in which the bone marrow is damaged, causing a 
deficiency of the red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets 
(thrombocytopenia). </p>

* if you are allergic to eltrombopag or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6 under  What Revolade contains ). </p>
<p>Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Revolade: 
* if you have liver problems. People who have low platelet counts as well as advanced chronic 
(long-term) liver disease are more at risk of side effects, including life-threatening liver damage 
and blood clots. If your doctor considers that the benefits of taking Revolade outweigh the risks, 
you will be closely monitored during treatment. 
* if you are at risk of blood clots in your veins or arteries, or you know that blood clots are 
common in your family. 
You may be at higher risk of blood clots:</p>
<ul>
<li>as you get older </li>
<li>if you have had to stay in bed for a long time </li>
<li>if you have cancer </li>
<li>if you are taking the contraceptive birth control pill or hormone replacement therapy </li>
<li>if you have recently had surgery or received a physical injury </li>
<li>if you are very overweight (obese) </li>
<li>if you are a smoker </li>
<li>if you have advanced chronic liver disease </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before starting treatment. You should not 
take Revolade unless your doctor considers that the expected benefits outweigh the risk of 
blood clots. 
* if you have cataracts (the lens of the eye getting cloudy) 
* if you have another blood condition, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Your doctor 
will carry out tests to check that you do not have this blood condition before you start Revolade. 
If you have MDS and take Revolade, your MDS may get worse. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. </p>
<p>Eye examinations 
Your doctor will recommend that you are checked for cataracts. If you do not have routine eye-tests 
your doctor should arrange regular testing. You may also be checked for the occurrence of any 
bleeding in or around your retina (the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye). </p>
<p>You will need regular tests 
Before you start taking Revolade, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check your blood cells, 
including platelets. These tests will be repeated at intervals while you are taking it. </p>
<p>Blood tests for liver function 
Revolade can cause blood test results that may be signs of liver damage - an increase of some liver 
enzymes, especially bilirubin and alanine / aspartate transaminases. If you are taking interferon-based 
treatments together with Revolade to treat low platelet count due to hepatitis C, some liver problems 
can get worse. </p>
<p>You will have blood tests to check your liver function before you start taking Revolade and at 
intervals while you are taking it. You may need to stop taking Revolade if the amount of these 
substances increases too much, or if you get other signs of liver damage. </p>
<p>Read the information  Liver problems  in section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Blood tests for platelet count 
If you stop taking Revolade, your blood platelet count is likely to become low again within several 
days. The platelet count will be monitored, and your doctor will discuss appropriate precautions with 
you. 
A very high blood platelet count may increase the risk of blood clotting. However blood clots can also 
form with normal or even low platelet counts. Your doctor will adjust your dose of Revolade to ensure 
that your platelet count does not become too high. </p>
<p>Get medical help immediately if you have any of these signs of a blood clot: 
* swelling, pain or tenderness in one leg 
* sudden shortness of breath especially together with sharp pain in the chest or rapid breathing 
* abdominal (stomach) pain, enlarged abdomen, blood in your stools </p>
<p>Tests to check your bone marrow 
In people who have problems with their bone marrow, medicines like Revolade could make the 
problems worse. Signs of bone marrow changes may show up as abnormal results in your blood tests. 
Your doctor may also carry out tests to directly check your bone marrow during treatment with 
Revolade. </p>
<p>Checks for digestive bleeding 
If you are taking interferon-based treatments together with Revolade you will be monitored for any 
signs of bleeding in your stomach or intestine after you stop taking Revolade. </p>
<p>Heart monitoring 
Your doctor may consider it necessary to monitor your heart during treatment with Revolade and carry 
out an electrocardiogram (ECG) test. </p>
<p>Older people (65 years and above) 
There are limited data on the use of Revolade in patients aged 65 years and older. Care should be 
taken when using Revolade if you are aged 65 years or above. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Revolade is not recommended for children aged under 1 year who have ITP. It is also not 
recommended for people under 18 years with low platelet counts due to hepatitis C or severe aplastic 
anaemia. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Revolade 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without prescription and vitamins. </p>
<p>Some everyday medicines interact with Revolade   including prescription and non-prescription 
medicines and minerals. These include: 
* antacid medicines to treat indigestion, heartburn or stomach ulcers (see also  When to take it<br />
in section 3) 
* medicines called statins, to lower cholesterol 
* some medicines to treat HIV infection, such as lopinavir and/or ritonavir 
* ciclosporin used in the context of transplantations or immune diseases 
* minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc which may be found 
in vitamin and mineral supplements (see also  When to take it  in section 3) 
* medicines such as methotrexate and topotecan, to treat cancer </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you take any of these. Some of them are not to be taken with Revolade, 
or the dose may need adjusting, or you may need to alter the timing of when you take them. 
Your doctor will review the medicines you are taking, and suggest suitable replacements if 
necessary. </p>
<p>If you are also taking medicines to prevent blood clots there is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor 
will discuss this with you. </p>
<p>If you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine you may need to take a lower dose or 
to stop taking them while you are taking Revolade. 
Revolade with food and drink

Higher risk of blood clots 
Certain people may have a higher risk of blood clots, and medicines like Revolade could make this 
problem worse. The sudden blocking of a blood vessel by a blood clot is an uncommon side effect and 
may affect up to 1 in 100 people. </p>
<p>Get medical help immediately if you develop signs and symptoms of a blood clot, such as: 
* swelling, pain, heat, redness, or tenderness in one leg 
* sudden shortness of breath, especially together with sharp pain in the chest or rapid breathing 
* abdominal (stomach) pain, enlarged abdomen, blood in your stools. </p>
<p>Liver problems 
Revolade can cause changes that show up in blood tests, and may be signs of liver damage. Liver 
problems (increased enzymes showing up in blood tests) are common and may affect up to 1 in 
10 people. Other liver problems are uncommon and may affect up to 1 in 100 people. </p>
<p>If you have either of these signs of liver problems: 
* yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes (jaundice) 
* unusually dark-coloured urine </p>
<p>tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Bleeding or bruising after you stop treatment 
Within two weeks of stopping Revolade, your blood platelet count will usually drop back down to 
what it was before starting Revolade. The lower platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding or 
bruising. Your doctor will check your platelet count for at least 4 weeks after you stop taking 
Revolade. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding or bruising after stopping Revolade. </p>
<p>Some people have bleeding in the digestive system after they stop taking peginterferon, ribavirin, and 
Revolade. Symptoms include: 
* black tarry stools (discoloured bowel movements are a uncommon side effect that may affect up 
to 1 in 100 people)
