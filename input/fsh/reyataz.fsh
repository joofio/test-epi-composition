inhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a 
protein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your 
body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of 
developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. </p>
<p>REYATAZ capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor has 
prescribed REYATAZ for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired 
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV 
medicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ 
is best for you. </p>         </div>"""

</ul>
<p>Do not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you 
are using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>REYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other 
illnesses linked to HIV infection. </p>
<p>Some people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have hepatitis B or C </li>
<li>if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach) </li>
<li>if you have type A or B haemophilia </li>
<li>if you require haemodialysis </li>
</ul>
<p>REYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. </p>
<p>Kidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of 
kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your 
doctor immediately. </p>
<p>In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the 
opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system 
attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your 
HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in 
hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor, or hyperactivity, 
please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe 
immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for 
developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches, and pains (especially of the 
hip, knee, and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please 
inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Hyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients 
receiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of 
these symptoms please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Serious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking 
REYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. 
Children receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide 
this. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The 
use of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been 
studied due to the risk of serious complications. </p>
<p>Other medicines and REYATAZ </p>
<p>You must not take REYATAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take 
REYATAZ, at the start of Section 2.<br />
There are other medicines that may not mix with REYATAZ. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have 
recently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: </p>
<ul>
<li>other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g., indinavir, nevirapine, and efavirenz) </li>
<li>sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) </li>
<li>sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction)) </li>
<li>if you are taking an oral contraceptive ("the Pill") with REYATAZ to prevent pregnancy, be 
sure to take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses </li>
<li>any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g., antacids to be taken 
1 hour before taking REYATAZ or 2 hours after taking REYATAZ, H2-blockers like 
famotidine and proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole) </li>
<li>medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, 
diltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil) </li>
<li>atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) </li>
<li>salmeterol (used to treat asthma) </li>
<li>cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune 
system) </li>
<li>certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin) </li>
<li>ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals) </li>
<li>apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor 
(used to reduce blood clots) </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and lamotrigine (antiepileptics) </li>
<li>encorafenib, ivosidenib, and irinotecan (used to treat cancer) </li>

<p>Some medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with REYATAZ. It is important 
to tell your doctor if you are taking an inhaled or nasal (given in the nose) corticosteroid, including 
fluticasone or budesonide (given to treat allergic symptoms or asthma). </p>
<p>REYATAZ with food and drink </p>
<p>It is important that you take REYATAZ with food (a meal or a substantial snack) as this helps the 
body absorb the medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Atazanavir, the active substance of REYATAZ, is excreted in human milk. Patients should not breast-
feed while taking REYATAZ. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>REYATAZ contains lactose. </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g., lactose), 
contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When 
treating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by 
the other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice 
anything unusual about your health. </p>
<p>During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects: </p>
<ul>
<li>Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually 
disappears within 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may 
be developed in association with other symptoms which could be serious. Stop taking 
REYATAZ and talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a severe rash or a rash with flu-
like illness symptoms, blisters, fever, mouth sores, muscle or joint pain, swelling in the face, 
inflammation of the eye which causes redness (conjunctivitis), painful, warm, or red lumps 
(nodules). </li>
<li>Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes caused by high levels of bilirubin in your 
blood has been commonly reported. This side effect is usually not dangerous in adults and 
infants older than 3 months of age; but it might be a symptom of a serious problem. If your skin 
or the white part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately. </li>
<li>Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to 
your doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be 
symptoms of a serious heart problem. </li>
<li>Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start 
REYATAZ and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C 
infection, you may experience a worsening of your liver problems. Talk to your doctor 
immediately if you get dark (tea-colored) urine, itching, yellowing of your skin or the white part 
of your eyes, pain around the stomach, pale-colored stools, or nausea. </li>
<li>
<p>Gallbladder problems uncommonly happen in people taking REYATAZ. Symptoms of 
gallbladder problems may include pain in the right or middle upper stomach area, nausea, 
vomiting, fever, or yellowing your skin or the white part of your eyes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work. </p>
</li>
