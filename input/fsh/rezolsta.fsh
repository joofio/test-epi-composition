REZOLSTA contains the active substances darunavir and cobicistat. 
Darunavir belongs to a group of HIV medicines called  protease inhibitors  which work by reducing 
the amount of HIV in your body to a very low level. It is given with cobicistat, which increases the 
amount of darunavir in your blood. 
Treatment with REZOLSTA will improve your immune system (your body s natural defences) and 
reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection, but REZOLSTA is not a cure for HIV 
infection.
What it is used for?
REZOLSTA is used to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 
40 kilograms and who are infected by HIV (see How to take REZOLSTA).
REZOLSTA must be taken in combination with other HIV medicines. Your doctor will discuss with 
you which combination of medicines is best for you.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking REZOLSTA.
People taking REZOLSTA may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection. You must keep in regular contact with your doctor.
People taking REZOLSTA may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or 
potentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.
In patients taking REZOLSTA and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) 
may occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.
REZOLSTA has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this 
age group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use REZOLSTA.
Make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.
-
Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C
infection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can 
take REZOLSTA.
-
Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your kidneys. Your doctor will carefully 
consider whether to treat you with REZOLSTA.
-
Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. REZOLSTA might increase sugar levels in the blood.
-
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged 
lymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of unusual 
infections due to a weakened immune system (opportunistic infection), signs and symptoms of 
inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after HIV treatment is started. It is 
believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
-
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs 
when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking 
medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the 
trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately 
so you can be given the necessary treatment.
-
Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. REZOLSTA might increase the risk of bleeding.
-
Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).
-
Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking 
combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of 
bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). This may be more likely with long-term 
HIV treatment, more severe damage to the immune system, overweight, or the use of alcohol or 
other medicines called corticosteroids. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains 
(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these 
symptoms please inform your doctor.
Children and adolescents
REZOLSTA is not for use in children younger than 12 years, or weighing less than 
40 kilograms.
Other medicines and REZOLSTA
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.
There are some medicines that you must not combine with REZOLSTA. These are mentioned above 
under the heading  Do not combine REZOLSTA with any of the following medicines: 
REZOLSTA must not be used with another antiviral medicine that contains a booster or another 
antiviral that requires boosting. In some cases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. 
Therefore, always tell your doctor if you take other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor s 
instruction carefully on which medicines can be combined.
The effects of REZOLSTA might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your 
doctor if you take:
-
Bosentan (to treat heart disease)
-
Dexamethasone (injectable) (corticosteroid)
-
Efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine (to treat HIV infection)
-
Rifapentine, rifabutin (to treat bacterial infections).
The effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take REZOLSTA and your doctor might 
want to do some additional blood tests. Tell your doctor if you take:
-
Amlodipine, carvedilol, diltiazem, disopyramide, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol, 
mexiletine, nicardipine, nifedipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the 
therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.
-
Apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin, clopidogrel (to reduce 
clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic effect or side effects may be altered.
-
Clonazepam (to prevent seizures).
-
Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. REZOLSTA
might reduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of 
non-hormonal contraception are recommended.
-
Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. REZOLSTA might increase the risk for elevated potassium 
levels by drospirenone.
-
Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). 
The risk of muscle damage might be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol 
lowering regimen is best for your specific situation.
-
Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as 
the therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased.
-
Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, 
triamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel 
diseases, inflammatory conditions of the skin, eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory 
conditions. These medicines are generally taken orally, inhaled, injected or applied to the skin.
If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation and under 
close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects.
-
Buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)
-
Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)
-

called pulmonary arterial hypertension)
-
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (to treat hepatitis C infection)
-
Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders).
Your doctor might want to do some additional blood tests and the dosage of other medicines might 
need to be changed since either their own or REZOLSTA s therapeutic effect or side effects may be 
influenced when combined. Tell your doctor if you take:
-
Dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood)
-
Alfentanil (injectable, strong and short-acting, painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)
-
Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)

Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Pregnant women
should not take REZOLSTA.
Because of the potential for side effects in breast-fed infants, women should not breast-feed if they are 
receiving REZOLSTA.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should 
discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following side effects
Liver problems that may occasionally be severe have been reported. Your doctor should do blood tests 
before you start REZOLSTA. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C infection, your doctor should check 
your blood tests more often because you have an increased chance of developing liver problems. Talk 
to your doctor about the signs and symptoms of liver problems. These may include yellowing of your 
skin or whites of your eyes, dark (tea coloured) urine, pale coloured stools (bowel movements), 
nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching, or pain and discomfort on your right side below 
your ribs.
A common side effect of REZOLSTA is skin rash (more often when used in combination with 
raltegravir), itching. The rash is usually mild to moderate. A skin rash might also be a symptom of a 
rare severe situation. It is, therefore, important to talk to your doctor if you develop a rash. Your 
doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms or whether REZOLSTA must be stopped.
