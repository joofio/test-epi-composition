REZZAYO contains the active substance rezafungin, which is an antifungal. Rezafungin belongs to a 
group of medicines called echinocandins. </p>
<p>What REZZAYO is used for 
This medicine is given to adults to treat invasive candidiasis, a serious fungal infection in your tissues 
or organs that is caused by a type of yeast called Candida. </p>
<p>How REZZAYO works 
This medicine blocks the action of an enzyme (a type of protein) that is needed by fungal cells to make 
a molecule that strengthens their cell walls. This makes the fungal cells fragile and stops the fungus 
from growing. This stops the infection from spreading and gives the body s natural defences a chance 
to remove the infection. </p>         </div>"""

any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given REZZAYO. </p>
<p>Effects on the liver 
Your doctor may decide to monitor you for liver function more closely if you develop liver problems 
during your treatment. </p>
<p>Infusion-related reactions 
REZZAYO may cause infusion-related reactions, which could include reddening of the skin 
(flushing), sensation of warmth, nausea (feeling sick) and chest tightness. Your doctor may decide to 
monitor you during the infusion for signs of an infusion-related reaction. Your doctor may decide to 
slow down your infusion (drip) if an infusion-related reaction occurs. </p>
<p>Light sensitivity 
REZZAYO may increase your risk of phototoxicity (condition in which the skin or eyes become very 
sensitive to sunlight or other forms of light). During your treatment, and for 7 days after you have been 
given the last dose of this medicine, you should avoid being out in the sun or using artificial sun 
tanning lights without protection (like sunscreen). </p>
<p>Other medicines and REZZAYO 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You should not use this medicine unless specifically told by your doctor. If you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding, or think you may be pregnant, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking 
this medicine. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you may be advised by your doctor to use 
contraception during your therapy with REZZAYO. 
The effect of REZZAYO in pregnant or breast-feeding women is not known. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine is unlikely to have an effect on driving or using machines. </p>

<p>Recommended dose 
Your treatment will start with a  loading dose' (an initial dose of a medicine which is higher than the 
maintenance dose) of 400 mg on the first day. This will be followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg 
on day 8 of your treatment and once weekly thereafter. </p>
<p>REZZAYO should be given to you once a week, by infusion (a drip) into your vein. This will take at 
least 1 hour. Your doctor will determine how long the infusion time will be and may increase it to up 
to 3 hours to avoid infusion-related reactions. </p>
<p>Your doctor will determine how long you need to receive treatment based on your response to the 
medicine and your condition. </p>
<p>In general, your treatment will continue for at least 14 days after the last day Candida was found in 
your blood. </p>
<p>If symptoms of invasive candidiasis come back, tell your doctor or another healthcare professional 
immediately. </p>
<p>If you have been given more REZZAYO than you should 
You should not receive this medicine more than once a week. If you are concerned that you may have 
been given too much REZZAYO, tell your doctor or another healthcare professional immediately. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of REZZAYO 
As you will be given this medicine under close medical supervision, it is unlikely that a dose would be 
missed. However, if you miss an appointment to receive this medicine, contact your doctor or another 
healthcare professional as soon as possible to schedule a new appointment. </p>
<p>If you stop using REZZAYO 
Your doctor will monitor your response and condition to determine when to stop your treatment with 
this medicine. You should not experience any side effects after this. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
