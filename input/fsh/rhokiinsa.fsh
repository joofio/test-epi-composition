<p>Rhokiinsa is used to lower pressure in the eyes in adults who have an eye condition known as 
glaucoma or who have raised pressure in their eyes. If the pressure in the eye is too high, it can

<p>Other medicines and Rhokiinsa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Rhokiinsa if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor still recommends it. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines

machines until the symptoms are cleared. </p>
<p>Rhokiinsa contains benzalkonium chloride 
This medicine contains approximately 150 micrograms benzalkonium chloride in each ml of solution.   </p>
<p>Benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the

<p>Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of 
the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye).  If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain 
in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>Only use Rhokiinsa for your eyes (ocular use). Do not swallow or inject.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye or eyes once a day in the evening. Use the 
medicine at around the same time each day. </p>
<p>How to use </p>
<p>Wash your hands before you start. </p>
<p>Do not touch the dropper with your fingers when opening or closing the bottle. It could infect 
the drops. </p>
<p>Twist off the bottle cap, and lie the cap on a clean surface on its side. Continue to hold the 
bottle, ensuring that the tip doesn t come into contact with anything.  </p>
<p>Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. </p>
<p>Tilt your head back. </p>
<p>Pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger to form a  pocket  between the eyelid and your 
eye. The drop will go in here (Picture 1). </p>
<p>Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps. </p>
<p>Do not touch your eye, eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could 
infect the drops. </p>
<p>Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of Rhokiinsa into your eye. </p>
<p>Only put one drop into your eye each time. If a drop misses your eye, try again. </p>
<p>If you need to use the drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye while you have 
the bottle open. </p>
<p>Put back the bottle cap to close the bottle. </p>
<p>If you are using other eye drops, wait at least five minutes after using them and then use Rhokiinsa. If 
you are using eye ointments, these should be used last. </p>
<p>If you use more Rhokiinsa than you should<br />
Rinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Rhokiinsa 
Continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.<br />
Do not use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) once a day.  </p>
<p>If you stop using Rhokiinsa 
Do not stop using Rhokiinsa without first speaking to your doctor. If you stop using Rhokiinsa the 
pressure in your eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
