* beclometasone dipropionate,<br />
<em> formoterol fumarate dihydrate and<br />
</em> glycopyrronium.  </p>
<p>Beclometasone dipropionate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids which act to 
reduce the swelling and irritation in your lungs. </p>
<p>Formoterol and glycopyrronium are medicines called long-acting bronchodilators. They act in 
different ways to relax the muscles in your airways, helping to open the airways wider and allowing 
you to breathe more easily. </p>
<p>Regular treatment with these three active substances helps to relieve and prevent symptoms such as 
shortness of breath, wheezing and cough in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). Riarify can reduce exacerbations (flare-ups) of COPD symptoms. COPD is a serious long-
term disease in which the airways become blocked and air sacs inside the lungs become damaged, 
leading to difficulty breathing. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate dihydrate and/or 
glycopyrronium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Riarify is used as a maintenance treatment for your obstructive lung disease. Do not use this medicine 
to treat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. </p>
<p>If your breathing gets worse </p>
<p>If you develop worsening shortness of breath or wheezing (breathing with a whistling sound), straight 
after inhaling your medicine, stop using Riarify inhaler and use your quick-acting “reliever” inhaler 
straightaway. You should contact your doctor straightaway. Your doctor will assess your symptoms 
and if necessary may start you on a different treatment.<br />
See also section 4, “Possible side effects”. </p>
<p>If your lung disease gets worse </p>
<p>If your symptoms get worse or are difficult to control (e.g. if you are using a separate “reliever” 
inhaler more frequently) or if your “reliever” inhaler does not improve your symptoms, see your 
doctor immediately. Your lung disease may be getting worse and your doctor may need to prescribe 
different treatment. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Riarify: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you have any heart problems, such as angina (heart pain, pain in the chest), a recent heart 
attack (myocardial infarction), heart failure, narrowing of the arteries around your heart 
(coronary heart disease), disease of your heart valves or any other abnormalities of your heart or 
if you have a condition known as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (also known as 
HOCM, a condition where the heart muscle is abnormal). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have disorders of your heart rhythm such as irregular heart rate, a fast pulse rate or 
palpitations or if you have been told that your heart trace (ECG) is abnormal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have narrowing of the arteries (also known as arteriosclerosis), if you have high blood 
pressure or if you have an aneurysm (abnormal bulging of the blood vessel wall). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have an overactive thyroid gland. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have low blood levels of potassium (hypokalaemia). The combination of Riarify with 
some other COPD medicines or medicines such as diuretics (medicines that make the body lose 
water, to treat heart disease or high blood pressure), can cause a sharp fall in your blood level of 
potassium. Therefore, your doctor may wish to measure the potassium levels in your blood from 
time to time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have any disease of your liver or kidneys. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have diabetes. High doses of formoterol may increase your blood glucose and therefore 
you may need to have extra blood tests to check your blood sugar when you start using this 
medicine, and from time to time during treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as a phaeochromocytoma). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are due to have an anaesthetic. Depending on the type of anaesthetic, it may be necessary 
to stop using Riarify at least 12 hours before the anaesthesia. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are being, or have ever been, treated for tuberculosis (TB) or if you have a chest 
infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have difficulty passing urine.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have an infection of the mouth or throat. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor before you use Riarify.<br />
If you have or have had any medical problems or any allergies or if you are not sure if you can use 
Riarify, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using the inhaler.  </p>
<p>If you are already using Riarify  </p>
<p>If you are using Riarify or high doses of other inhaled corticosteroids over long periods and you come 
into a situation of stress (e.g. being taken to hospital after an accident, having a serious injury or 
before an operation) you may need more of this medicine. In such a situation, your doctor may need to 
increase your dose of corticosteroids to cope with the stress and may prescribe them as tablets or 
injections. 
Contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Riarify 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines similar to Riarify used for your lung disease.  </p>
<p>Some medicines may increase the effects of Riarify and your doctor may wish to monitor you 
carefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat). </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine with a beta-blocker medicine (used for treating certain heart problems 
such as angina or for reducing blood pressure) unless your doctor has chosen a beta-blocker that does 
not affect your breathing. Beta-blockers (including beta-blocker eye-drops) may reduce the effects of 
formoterol or make it not work at all. On the other hand, using other beta2-agonist medicines (which 
work in the same way as formoterol) may increase the effects of formoterol. </p>
<p>Using Riarify together with:  </p>
<ul>
<li>medicines for treating  </li>
<li>abnormal heart rhythms (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide),  </li>
<li>allergic reactions (antihistamines),  </li>
<li>
<p>symptoms of depression or mental disorders such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (for 
example phenelzine and isocarboxazid), tricyclic antidepressants (for example amitriptyline 
and imipramine), phenothiazines<br />
can cause some changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG, heart trace). They may also increase 
the risk of disturbances of heart rhythm (ventricular arrhythmias). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicines for treating Parkinson’s disease (levodopa), to treat an underactive thyroid gland 
(levothyroxine), medicines containing oxytocin (which causes uterine contraction) and alcohol 
can increase the chances of formoterol side effects on the heart. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including medicines with similar properties like 
furazolidone and procarbazine, used to treat mental disorders, can cause a rise in blood pressure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medicines for treating heart disease (digoxin) can cause a fall in your blood potassium level. 
This may increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other medicines used to treat COPD (theophylline, aminophylline or corticosteroids) and 
diuretics may also cause a fall in your potassium level.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some anaesthetics can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disulfiram, a medicine used in the treatment of people with alcoholism (drinking problems) or 
metronidazole, an antibiotic to treat infection in your body can cause side effects (e.g. feeling 
sick, being sick, stomach pain) due to the small amount of alcohol in Riarify. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>You should only use Riarify during pregnancy if you are advised to do so by your doctor. It is 
preferable to avoid the use of Riarify during labour due to the inhibitory effects of formoterol on 
uterine contractions. 
You should not use Riarify during breast-feeding. You and your doctor must make a decision whether 
to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Riarify therapy taking into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for your child and the benefit of therapy for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Riarify is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Riarify contains ethanol 
Riarify contains 8.856 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each actuation, which is equivalent to 17.712 mg per 
dose of two actuations. The amount in two actuations of this medicine is equivalent to less than 1 ml 
of wine or beer. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you feel that the medicine is not very effective, talk to your doctor. 
If you have been using a different inhaler containing beclometasone dipropionate previously, ask your 
doctor for advice, as the effective dose of beclometasone dipropionate in Riarify for the treatment of 
COPD may be lower than that of some other inhalers.  </p>
<p>Route of administration 
Riarify is for inhalation use. 
You should inhale the medicine through your mouth and this takes the medicine directly into your 
lungs. </p>
<p>This medicine is contained in a pressurised container in a plastic inhaler with a mouthpiece.  </p>
<p>Riarify is available in three container sizes:<br />
* a container providing 60 puffs 
* a container providing 120 puffs 
* a container providing 180 puffs. </p>
<p>If you have been prescribed a container providing 60 puffs or 120 puffs 
There is a counter on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. Each time you 
press the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the counter will count down by one. 
Take care not to drop the inhaler as this may cause the counter to count down. </p>
<p>If you have been prescribed a container providing 180 puffs 
There is an indicator on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. Each time 
you press the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the dose indicator rotates by a 
small amount. The number of puffs remaining is displayed in intervals of 20. Take care not to drop the 
inhaler as this may cause the dose indicator to count down. </p>
<p>Testing your inhaler 
Before using the inhaler for the first time, you should test your inhaler to make sure that it is working 
properly, as follows.  </p>         </div>"""
