<p>The active substance in Riluzole Zentiva is riluzole which acts on the nervous system. </p>
<p>What Riluzole Zentiva is used for </p>
<p>Riluzole Zentiva is used in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). </p>
<p>ALS is a form of motor neurone disease where attacks of the nerve cells responsible for sending 
instructions to the muscles lead to weakness, muscle waste and paralysis. </p>
<p>The destruction of nerve cells in motor neurone disease may be caused by too much glutamate (a 
chemical messenger) in the brain and spinal cord. Riluzole Zentiva stops the release of glutamate and 
this may help in preventing the nerve cells being damaged. </p>
<p>Please consult your doctor for more information about ALS and the reason why this medicine has been 
prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Annex IV 
Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisation(s) </p>
<p>Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for riluzole, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:<br />
In view of available data on rash from spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal 
relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC concluded that a causal 
relationship between riluzole and rash is at least a reasonable possibility and the product 
information of products containing riluzole should be amended accordingly. </p>
<p>The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. </p>
<p>Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for riluzole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing riluzole is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. </p>         </div>"""
