Rimmyrah is a solution which is injected into the eye. Rimmyrah belongs to a group of medicines 
called antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab. </p>
<p>What Rimmyrah is used for 
Rimmyrah is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment. </p>
<p>These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) 
caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels. This is observed in diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, a disease caused by 
diabetes). It may also be associated with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic 
myopia (PM), angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy or inflammatory CNV. </li>
<li>Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused by diabetes 
(a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of retinal veins of the 
retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)). </li>
</ul>
<p>How Rimmyrah works 
Rimmyrah specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and 
swelling in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like AMD, DME, PDR, RVO, 
PM and CNV. By binding to VEGF-A, Rimmyrah can block its actions and prevent this abnormal 
growth and swelling. </p>
<p>In these diseases, Rimmyrah can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision. </p>         </div>"""

- If you are allergic to ranibizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have an infection in or around your eye. 
- If you have pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in your eye. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Rimmyrah. 
- Rimmyrah is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion 
of the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of 
the eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or 
clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur after Rimmyrah treatment. It is important to identify 
and treat such an infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell your doctor 
immediately if you develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision or 
increased sensitivity to light. 
- In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
- This is something you may not notice, therefore your doctor may monitor this after each 
injection. 
- Inform your doctor if you have a prior history of eye conditions or eye treatments, or if you 
have had a stroke or experienced transient signs of stroke (weakness or paralysis of limbs or 
face, difficulty speaking or understanding). This information will be taken into account to 
evaluate if Rimmyrah is the appropriate treatment for you. </p>
<p>Please see section 4 ( Possible side effects ) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Rimmyrah therapy. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) 
The use of Rimmyrah in children and adolescents has not been established and is therefore not 
recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rimmyrah 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least three further months after the last injection of Rimmyrah. 
- There is no experience of using Rimmyrah in pregnant women. Rimmyrah should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If 
you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with 
your doctor before treatment with Rimmyrah. 
- Small amounts of ranibizumab may pass into breast milk, therefore Rimmyrah is not 
recommended during breast-feeding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before 
Rimmyrah treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
After Rimmyrah treatment you may experience some temporary vision blurring. If this happens, do 
not drive or use machines until this resolves. </p>         </div>"""

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu </p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR HEALTHCARE       <br />
PROFESSIONALS ONLY: </p>
<p>Please also refer to section 3  How Rimmyrah is given . </p>
<p>Single-use vial for intravitreal use only </p>
<p>Rimmyrah must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. </p>
<p>In wet AMD, in CNV, in PDR and in visual impairment due to DME or to macular oedema secondary 
to RVO the recommended dose for Rimmyrah is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks. </p>
<p>Treatment is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or 
there are no signs of disease activity i.e., no change in visual acuity and in other signs and symptoms 
of the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, initially, 
three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed. </p>
<p>Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. </p>
<p>If, in the physician s opinion, visual and anatomical parameters indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, Rimmyrah should be discontinued. </p>
<p>Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography). </p>
<p>If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly. </p>
<p>The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year. </p>
<p>Ranibizumab and laser photocoagulation in DME and macular oedema secondary to BRVO 
There is some experience of ranibizumab administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation. 
When given on the same day, ranibizumab should be administered at least 30 minutes after laser 
photocoagulation. ranibizumab can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation. </p>
<p>Ranibizumab and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM 
There is no experience of concomitant administration of ranibizumab and verteporfin. </p>
<p>Rimmyrah should be inspected visually to ensure there is no particulate matter, discolouration or 
disturbance prior to the administration. If particulate matter, discolouration or disturbance is observed, 
the vial should be discarded per local disposal guidelines. 
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure. 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance with local practice. </p>
<p>Vial-only pack 
The vial is for single use only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Any vial 
showing signs of damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the 
packaging seal remains intact. </p>
<p>For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 5  m filter needle (18G   1  inches, 1.2 mm   40 mm) </li>
<li>a 1 ml sterile syringe (including a 0.05 ml mark) </li>
<li>an injection needle (30G     inches). 
These medical devices are not included within the Rimmyrah pack. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vial + filter needle pack 
All components are sterile and for single use only. Any component with packaging showing 
signs of damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the 
component packaging seal remains intact. Re-use may lead to infection or other illness/injury. </p>
<p>For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 5  m filter needle (18G   1  inches, 1.2 mm   40 mm, provided) </li>
<li>a 1 ml sterile syringe (including a 0.05 ml mark, not included within the Rimmyrah pack) </li>
<li>an injection needle (30G     inches; not included within the Rimmyrah pack) </li>
</ul>
<p>To prepare Rimmyrah for intravitreal administration to adult patients, please adhere to the following<br />
instructions: </p>
<p>Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rimmyrah should be inspected visually to ensure there is 
no particulate matter, discolouration or disturbance prior 
to the administration. If particulate matter, discolouration 
or disturbance is observed, the vial should be discarded 
per local disposal guidelines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before withdrawal, the outer part of the rubber stopper of
