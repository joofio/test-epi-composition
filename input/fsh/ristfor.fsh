  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Ristfor contains two different medicines called sitagliptin and metformin.
* sitagliptin belongs to a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 inhibitors)
* metformin belongs to a class of medicines called biguanides.
They work together to control blood sugar levels in adult patients with a form of diabetes called
 type 2 diabetes mellitus . This medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal
and lowers the amount of sugar made by your body.
Along with diet and exercise, this medicine helps lower your blood sugar. This medicine can be used
alone or with certain other medicines for diabetes (insulin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones).
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that
your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar.
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems
like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.</p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to sitagliptin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine
(listed in section 6) 
- if you have severely reduced kidney function
- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with e.g. severe hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose),
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see  Risk of 
 lactic acidosis 
below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called  ketone bodies 
accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include stomach
pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity smell.
- if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated
- if you are going to have an X-ray where you will be injected with a dye. You will need to stop
taking Ristfor at the time of the X-ray and for 2 or more days after as directed by your doctor,
depending on how your kidneys are working
- if you have recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems, such as  shock  or
breathing difficulties
- if you have liver problems
- if you drink alcohol to excess (either every day or only from time to time)
- if you are breast-feeding.
Do not take Ristfor if any of the above apply to you and talk with your doctor about other ways of
managing your diabetes. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking
Ristfor.
Warnings and precautions
Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving Ristfor
(see section 4).
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid.
Your doctor may ask you to stop Ristfor.
Risk of lactic acidosis
Ristfor may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your
kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with
uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further
information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a
reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). 
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Ristfor for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with
dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to
heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.
Stop taking Ristfor and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience
some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>stomach ache (abdominal pain)</li>
<li>muscle cramps</li>
<li>a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness</li>
<li>difficulty in breathing</li>
<li>
<p>reduced body temperature and heartbeat
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ristfor:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis)</p>
</li>
<li>if you have or have had gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a
form of fat) in your blood. These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting
pancreatitis (see section 4).</li>
<li>if you have type 1 diabetes. This is sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes</li>
<li>if you have or have had an allergic reaction to sitagliptin, metformin, or Ristfor (see section 4)</li>
<li>if you are taking a sulphonylurea or insulin, diabetes medicines, together with Ristfor, as you
may experience low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). Your doctor may reduce the dose of
your sulphonylurea or insulin
If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Ristfor during and for some time after the
procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with
Ristfor.
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking
Ristfor. 
During treatment with Ristfor, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or
more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not use this medicine. It is not effective in children
and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and
effective when used in children younger than 10 years.
Other medicines and Ristfor
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for
example, in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Ristfor before or at the time of the
injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with Ristfor.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may
need to adjust the dose of Ristfor. It is especially important to mention the following:</li>
<li>medicines (taken by mouth, inhalation, or injection) used to treat diseases that involve
inflammation, like asthma and arthritis (corticosteroids) </li>
<li>medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) </li>
<li>medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as
ibuprofen and celecoxib)</li>
<li>certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II
receptor antagonists)</li>
<li>specific medicines for the treatment of bronchial asthma ( -sympathomimetics)</li>
<li>iodinated contrast agents or alcohol-containing medicines</li>
<li>certain medicines used to treat stomach problems such as cimetidine </li>
<li>ranolazine, a medicine used to treat angina</li>
<li>dolutegravir, a medicine used to treat HIV infection</li>
<li>vandetanib, a medicine used to treat a specific type of thyroid cancer (medullary thyroid cancer)</li>
<li>digoxin (to treat irregular heartbeat and other heart problems). The level of digoxin in your
blood may need to be checked if taking with Ristfor.
Ristfor with alcohol
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Ristfor since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis
(see section  Warnings and precautions ).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should not take this medicine
during pregnancy. Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding. See section 2, Do not take
Ristfor.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However,
dizziness and drowsiness have been reported with sitagliptin, which may affect your ability to drive or
use machines.
Taking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause
hypoglycaemia, which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work without safe
foothold.
Ristfor contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .</li>

 Warnings and precautions ).
If you forget to take Ristfor
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your
next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose of
this medicine.
If you stop taking Ristfor
Continue to take this medicine as long as your doctor prescribes it so you can continue to help control
your blood sugar. You should not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first. If you
