doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under 
closer observation. </p>

- it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris before and after the operation exactly at the 
times you have been told by your doctor.<br />
- If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or 
spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction):<br />
<em> it is very important to take Rivaroxaban Viatris before and after the injection or removal 
of the catheter exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor<br />

<p>How much to take<br />
The recommended dose is one 2.5 mg tablet twice a day. Take Rivaroxaban Viatris around the same 
time every day (for example, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). This medicine can be 
taken with or without food.  </p>
<p>If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take

Your doctor will also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid. If you get Rivaroxaban Viatris after an acute

If you get Rivaroxaban Viatris after a procedure to open a narrowed or closed artery of your leg to 
restore blood flow, your doctor may also prescribe clopidogrel for you to take in addition to 
acetylsalicylic acid for a short while. </p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much of these to take (usually between 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid 
daily or a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid plus a daily dose of either 75 mg clopidogrel

<p>When to start Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Treatment with Rivaroxaban Viatris after an acute coronary syndrome should be started as soon as 
possible after stabilisation of the acute coronary syndrome, at the earliest 24 hours after admission to 
hospital and at the time when parenteral (via injection) anticoagulation therapy would normally be 
stopped.<br />
Your doctor will tell you when to start treatment with Rivaroxaban Viatris if you have been diagnosed 
with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease.<br />
Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment.  </p>
<p>If you take more Rivaroxaban Viatris than you should 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Rivaroxaban Viatris tablets. Taking too 
much Rivaroxaban Viatris increases the risk of bleeding. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If you miss a dose, take your next dose at the 
usual time. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris 
Take Rivaroxaban Viatris on a regular basis and for as long as your doctor keeps prescribing it.  </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Rivaroxaban Viatris without talking to your doctor first. If you stop taking this 
medicine, it may increase your risk of having another heart attack or stroke or dying from a disease 
related to your heart or your blood vessels.  </p>
