  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>The active substance of Rivastigmine Sandoz is rivastigmine. </p>
<p>Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with 
Alzheimer s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, 
resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to 
communicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down 
acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, 
Rivastigmine Sandoz allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the 
symptoms of Alzheimer s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson s disease. </p>
<p>Rivastigmine Sandoz is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe 
Alzheimer s dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability 
and behaviour. The capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult 
patients with Parkinson s disease. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Rivastigmine Sandoz 
- if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance of Rivastigmine Sandoz) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).<br />
- if you have had a previous skin reaction suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with 
rivastigmine. </p>
<p>If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Rivastigmine Sandoz. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Rivastigmine Sandoz 
- if you have, or have ever had irregular or slow heartbeat. 
- if you have, or have ever had an active stomach ulcer. 
- if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. 
- if you have, or have ever had, seizures. 
- if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease. 
- if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function. 
- if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function. 
- if you suffer from trembling. 
- if you have a low body weight.<br />
- if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and 
diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are 
prolonged. </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this 
medicine.  </p>
<p>If you have not taken Rivastigmine Sandoz for more than three days, do not take the next dose until 
you have talked to your doctor. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
There is no relevant use of Rivastigmine Sandoz in the paediatric population in the treatment of 
Alzheimer s disease. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rivastigmine Sandoz 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Rivastigmine Sandoz should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to 
Rivastigmine Sandoz. Rivastigmine Sandoz might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines 
used to relieve stomach cramps or spasms, to treat Parkinson s disease or to prevent travel sickness). 
Rivastigmine Sandoz should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to 
relieve or prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems 
such as stiff limbs and trembling hands. </p>
<p>If you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Rivastigmine Sandoz, tell your doctor before you are 
given any anaesthetics, because Rivastigmine Sandoz may exaggerate the effects of some muscle 
relaxants during anaesthesia.  </p>
<p>Caution when Rivastigmine Sandoz is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol 
used to treat hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together 
could cause problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of 
consciousness. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Rivastigmine Sandoz must be assessed against the possible 
effects on your unborn child. Rivastigmine Sandoz should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary.  </p>
<p>You should not breast-feed during treatment with Rivastigmine Sandoz.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Rivastigmine Sandoz may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when 
increasing the dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that 
require your attention. </p>         </div>"""

If you accidentally take more Rivastigmine Sandoz than you should, inform your doctor. You may 
require medical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Rivastigmine Sandoz 
have experienced feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and 
hallucinations. Slow heartbeat and fainting may also occur. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Rivastigmine Sandoz
