  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Riximyo is
Riximyo contains the active substance  rituximab . This is a type of protein called a  monoclonal 
antibody . It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called  B-Lymphocyte . When 
rituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies.
What Riximyo is used for
Riximyo may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults and children. Your 
doctor may prescribe Riximyo for the treatment of:
a)
Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma
This is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell 
called B-Lymphocytes.
In adults Riximyo can be given alone or with other medicines called  chemotherapy .
In adult patients where the treatment is working, Riximyo may be used as a maintenance treatment for 
2 years after completing the initial treatment.
In children and adolescents, rituximab is given in combination with  chemotherapy .
b)
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
CLL is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects a particular lymphocyte, the B cell, 
which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph nodes. Patients with CLL have too 
many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. The 
proliferation of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. Riximyo in 
combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually removed from the body by 
biological processes.
c)
Rheumatoid arthritis
Riximyo is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease of the 
joints. B lymphocytes are involved in the cause of some of the symptoms you have. Riximyo is used to 
treat rheumatoid arthritis in people who have already tried some other medicines which have either 
stopped working, have not worked well enough or have caused side effects. Riximyo is usually taken 
together with another medicine called methotrexate.
Riximyo slows down the damage to your joints caused by rheumatoid arthritis and improves your 
ability to do normal daily activities.
The best responses to Riximyo are seen in those who have a positive blood test to rheumatoid factor 
(RF) and/or anti- Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP). Both tests are commonly positive in 
rheumatoid arthritis and aid in confirming the diagnosis.
d)
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)
Riximyo is used for the treatment of adults and children 2 years of age and older with GPA (formerly 
called Wegener s granulomatosis) or MPA, taken in combination with corticosteroids. 
GPA and MPA are two forms of inflammation of the blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and 
kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. B lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these 
conditions.
e)
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV)
Riximyo is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. 
PV is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of the mouth, nose, 
throat and genitals.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Riximyo if:</p>
<p>you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</p>
<p>you have a severe active infection at the moment.</p>
<p>you have a weak immune system.</p>
<p>you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have rheumatoid arthritis, 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris.
Do not have Riximyo if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before you are given Riximyo. 
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Riximyo if:</p>
<p>you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, 
Riximyo could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. 
Patients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for 
signs of this infection.</p>
<p>you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing 
problems.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Riximyo. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with 
Riximyo.
Also talk to your doctor if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including 
vaccinations needed to travel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time 
as Riximyo or in the months after you receive Riximyo. Your doctor will check if you should have any 
vaccines before you receive Riximyo.
If you have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA) or pemphigus vulgaris (PV) also tell your doctor</p>
<p>if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected 
by Riximyo help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you 
are given Riximyo. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or suffer 
from severe infections.
Children and adolescents
Non-Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Rituximab can be used for the treatment of children and adolescents, 6 months of age and older, with 
non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, specifically CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 
Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like 
lymphoma (BLL). 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)
Rituximab can be used for treatment of children and adolescents, 2 years of age and older, with GPA 
(formerly called Wegener s granulomatosis) or MPA. There is not much information about the use of 
rituximab in children and adolescents with other diseases.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are 
under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Riximyo
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Riximyo can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can 
affect the way Riximyo works.
In particular, tell your doctor:</p>
<p>if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other 
medicines 12 hours before you are given Riximyo. This is because some people have a fall in 
their blood pressure while they are being given Riximyo.</p>
<p>if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system   such as chemotherapy or 
immune-suppressive medicines.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Riximyo.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are 
planning to become pregnant. This is because Riximyo can cross the placenta and may affect your 
baby.
If you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while 
using Riximyo. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with Riximyo. Riximyo 
passes into breast milk in very small amounts. As the long-term effects on breastfed infants are not 
known, for precautionary reasons, breast feeding is not recommended during treatment with Riximyo 
and for 6 months after the treatment.
Driving and using machines
It is not known whether rituximab has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or 
machines.
Riximyo contains sodium
This medicine contains 52.6 mg sodium (main component of the cooking/table salt) in each 10 mL 
vial and 263.2 mg in each 50 mL vial. 
This is equivalent to 2.6% (for 10 ml vial) and 13.2% (for 50 ml vial) of the recommended maximum 
daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

your disease, your doctor will decide when you should receive more Riximyo. This may be months 
from now.
d)
If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA)
Treatment with Riximyo uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will 
usually be given by injection before the start of Riximyo treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth 
may be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition.
If you are 18 years of age or older and respond well to treatment, you may be given Riximyo as a 
maintenance treatment. This will be administered as 2 separate infusions which are given 2 weeks 
apart, followed by 1 infusion every 6 months for at least 2 years. Your doctor may decide to treat you 
longer with Riximyo (up to 5 years), depending on how you respond to the medicine.
e)

Most side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of 
these reactions have been fatal.
Infusion reactions
During or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less 
frequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness (nausea), 
tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat discomfort, tongue 
or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number 
of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get worse. Tell the person 
giving you the infusion immediately if you or your child develops any of these symptoms, as the 
infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional treatment such as an 
antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can be 
continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion. Your doctor may decide 
to stop your Riximyo treatment if these reactions are serious.
Infections
Tell your doctor immediately if you or your child gets signs of an infection including:</p>
<p>fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell</p>
<p>memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss  these may be due to a very rare, 
serious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or 
PML).</p>
<p>fever, headache and stiff neck, incoordination (ataxia), personality change, hallucinations, 
altered consciousness, seizures or coma   these may be due to a serious brain infection

These are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia, urinary infections and serious viral 
infections. These are listed below under  Other side effects . 
If you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic 
polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, you will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you 
have been given by your doctor. It is important that you keep this Alert Card and show it to your 
partner or caregiver.
