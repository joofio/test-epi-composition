Warnings and precautions
Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with RIXUBIS. Stop your infusion and contact 
your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care if you experience early signs of 
hypersensitivity/allergic reactions like hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure 
or anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/or breathing, red or 
swollen face and/or hands). Your doctor may need to treat you promptly for these reactions. Your 
doctor may also do a blood test to check if you have developed activity-neutralising antibodies
(inhibitors) against your medicine, as inhibitors may develop together with allergies. Patients with 
factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with factor IX.
Talk to your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected or if you experience a 
significant increase in your usage of RIXUBIS in order to control a bleed. Your doctor will do a blood 
test to check if you have developed activity-neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against RIXUBIS. The 
risk for developing inhibitors is highest in patients who have not been treated with a factor IX 
replacement medicine before or in the early phases of treatment, i.e. for small children.
The production of factor IX in the body is controlled by the factor IX gene. Patients who have specific 
mutations of their factor IX gene such as major deletion may be more likely to have factor IX 
inhibitors and an allergic reaction in the early period with any factor IX concentrate. Therefore if you 
are known to have such a mutation, your doctor will monitor you more closely for signs of an allergic 
reaction.
If you suffer from liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had major surgery, please inform 
your doctor, as there is an increased risk for blood clotting (coagulation) complications.
Kidney disorders (nephrotic syndrome) have been reported following high doses of Factor IX in 
haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
Whenever possible, please record the name of the product and the batch number every time you use 
RIXUBIS (e.g. in your diary) to keep track of the products and product batches you have used.
Other medicines and RIXUBIS
Tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used or might use any other medicines. No 
interactions of RIXUBIS with other medicines are known.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia B very rarely occurs in women.
Driving and using machines
RIXUBIS has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
RIXUBIS contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . However, depending on your body weight and your dose of RIXUBIS, you could receive more 
than one vial. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.</p>         </div>"""

haemophilia B.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.
Your doctor will decide the dose of RIXUBIS you will receive. This dose and duration will depend on 
the severity of your factor IX deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on your 
clinical condition, age and how quickly your body uses up factor IX which will have to be checked 
regularly.
RIXUBIS is administered by intravenous infusion (IV) after reconstitution of the powder with the 
provided solvent by your doctor or nurse. You or somebody else might also administer RIXUBIS as 
an injection but only after receiving adequate training.
Reconstitution and administration
-
For reconstitution use only the solvent and the reconstitution device (BAXJECT II) provided in 
the pack.
-
For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required.
-
Do not use if the BAXJECT II device, its sterile barrier system or its packaging is damaged or 
shows any sign of deterioration.
Reconstitution
Use Aseptic Technique
1. If the product is stored in a refrigerator, take both the RIXUBIS powder and solvent vials from 
the refrigerator and let them reach room temperature (between 15 C and 30 C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3. Remove caps from powder and solvent vials.
4. Cleanse stoppers with alcohol swabs. Place the vials on a flat clean surface.
5. Open the package of BAXJECT II device by peeling away the paper lid without touching the 
inside (Fig. a). Do not remove the device from the package.
6. Turn the package over and insert the clear plastic spike through the solvent stopper. Grip the 
package at its edge and pull the package off BAXJECT II (Fig. b). Do not remove the blue cap 
from the BAXJECT II device.</p>         </div>"""

Be sure that RIXUBIS is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will pass 
through the device filter. Reconstituted medicinal products should be inspected visually for
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be clear or 
slightly opalescent. Do not use solution that are cloudy or have deposits.

Do not refrigerate the preparation after reconstitution.
Use immediately.
Administration
Use Aseptic Technique
1. Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT II. Do not draw air into the syringe. Connect the 
syringe to BAXJECT II (Fig. d).
2. Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the 
reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Fig. e).
3. Disconnect the syringe.
4. Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe. Inject intravenously. The solution should be 
administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient s comfort level, not to exceed 10 ml 
per minute.
