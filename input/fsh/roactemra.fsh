cells (monoclonal antibody), that blocks the action of a specific protein (cytokine) called interleukin-6. This protein is involved in inflammatory processes of the body, and blocking it can reduce the 
inflammation in your body. RoActemra helps to reduce symptoms such as pain and swelling in your 
joints and can also improve your performance of daily tasks. RoActemra has been shown to slow the 
damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve your ability to do 
normal daily activities. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>RoActemra is used to treat adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
an autoimmune disease, if previous therapies did not work well enough. RoActemra is usually 
given in combination with methotrexate. However, RoActemra can be given alone if your 
doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RoActemra can also be used to treat adults who have not had previous methotrexate treatment 
if they have severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RoActemra is used to treat children with sJIA. RoActemra is used for children aged 2 years 
and over who have active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), an inflammatory 
disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints as well as fever and rash. 
RoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of sJIA and can be given in combination with 
methotrexate or alone. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RoActemra is used to treat children with pJIA. RoActemra is used for children aged 2 
years and over with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), an inflammatory 
disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints. RoActemra is used to improve the 
symptoms of pJIA and can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RoActemra is used to treat adults and children aged 2 years and over with severe or life-
threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a side-effect in patients treated with chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies used to treat certain types of cancer.  </p>

* if you are allergic to tocilizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
Section 6). 
* if you have an active, severe infection. 
If any of these applies to you, tell the doctor or nurse giving you the infusion. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given RoActemra. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or 
light-headedness, swelling of the lips or skin rash during or after the infusion, then tell your 
doctor immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have any kind of infection, short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your 
doctor immediately if you feel unwell. RoActemra can reduce your body s ability to respond 
to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new 
infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have had tuberculosis, tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms 
of tuberculosis before starting RoActemra. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, 
weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell 
your doctor immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have had intestinal ulcers or diverticulitis, tell your doctor. Symptoms would include 
abdominal pain and unexplained changes in bowel habits with a fever. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have liver disease, tell your doctor. Before you use RoActemra, your doctor may do a 
blood test to measure your liver function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any patient has recently been vaccinated (either adult or child), or is planning a 
vaccination, tell your doctor. All patients, especially children, should be up-to-date with all 
their vaccinations before they start treatment with RoActemra, unless urgent treatment 
initiation is required. Certain types of vaccines should not be used while receiving 
RoActemra. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have cancer, tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given 
RoActemra. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have cardiovascular risk factors such as raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol 
levels, tell your doctor. These factors need to be monitored while receiving RoActemra. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have moderate to severe kidney function problems, your doctor will monitor you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have persistent headaches. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will perform blood tests before you are given RoActemra, and during your treatment, to 
determine if you have a low white blood cell count, low platelet count or high liver enzymes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
RoActemra is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age. </p>
<p>If a child has a history of macrophage activation syndrome, (activation and uncontrolled proliferation 
of specific blood cells), tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if they can still be given 
RoActemra. </p>
<p>Other medicines and RoActemra 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines (or your child is, if they are the patient), or have 
recently taken any. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription.  RoActemra can affect the 
way some medicines work, and the dose of these may require adjustment. If you are using medicines 
containing any of the following active substances, tell your doctor: </p>
<ul>
<li>methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, used to reduce inflammation </li>
<li>simvastatin or atorvastatin, used to reduce cholesterol levels </li>
<li>calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine), used to treat raised blood pressure </li>
<li>theophylline, used to treat asthma </li>
<li>warfarin or phenprocoumon, used as a blood thinning agents </li>
<li>phenytoin, used to treat convulsions </li>
<li>ciclosporin, used to suppress your immune system during organ transplants </li>
<li>benzodiazepines (e.g. temazepam), used to relieve anxiety. </li>
</ul>
<p>Due to lack of clinical experience, RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological 
medicines for the treatment of RA, sJIA or pJIA. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
RoActemra is not to be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Talk to your doctor if you are 
pregnant, may be pregnant, or intend to become pregnant.  </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after 
treatment.  </p>
<p>Stop breast-feeding if you are to be given RoActemra, and talk to your doctor. Leave a gap of at 
least 3 months after your last treatment before you start breast-feeding. It is not known whether 
RoActemra is passed into breast milk.  </p>
<p>The data available so far does not suggest any effect on fertility from this treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy, do not drive or use machines.  </p>
<p>RoActemra contains sodium 
This medicine contains 26.55 mg sodium per maximum dose of 1200 mg. Take this into account if 
you are on a low-sodium diet. However, doses below 1025 mg of this medicine contain less than 
23 mg sodium, so they are virtually sodium free. </p>         </div>"""
