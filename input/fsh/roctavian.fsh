ROCTAVIAN is a gene therapy product that contains the active substance valoctocogene 
roxaparvovec. A gene therapy product works by delivering a gene into the body to correct a genetic 
deficiency. </p>
<p>What ROCTAVIAN is used for 
This medicine is used for the treatment of severe haemophilia A in adults who do not have current or 
past inhibitors to factor VIII and who do not have antibodies to the virus vector AAV5.  </p>
<p>Haemophilia A is a condition where people inherit an altered form of a gene needed to make 
factor VIII, an essential protein required for blood to clot and stop any bleeding. People with 
haemophilia A cannot produce factor VIII and are prone to internal or external bleeding episodes. </p>
<p>How does ROCTAVIAN work 
The active substance in ROCTAVIAN is based on a virus which does not cause disease in humans. 
This virus has been modified so that it cannot spread in the body but can deliver a working copy of the 
factor VIII gene into liver cells. This enables liver cells to produce factor VIII protein and raise levels 
of working factor VIII in the blood. In turn, this helps the blood to clot more normally and prevents 
bleeding or reduces bleeding episodes. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to valoctocogene roxaparvovec or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
- if you have an active infection or if you have a chronic (long-term) infection that is not 
controlled by medicines you take, or if you have scarring of the liver (significant liver fibrosis 
or cirrhosis), as this could affect your body’s initial response to ROCTAVIAN. 
- if you have antibodies to the type of virus used to make this medicine. Your doctor will test you 
beforehand to see if this is the case. </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure of any of the above, please talk to your doctor 
before you receive ROCTAVIAN. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Importance of liver health 
* Your liver is the organ that produces factor VIII after treatment with ROCTAVIAN. You should 
take care of your liver’s health so that it is functioning as optimally as possible and you can 
produce factor VIII and continue to produce factor VIII on an ongoing basis. 
* Talk to your doctor about what you can do to improve and maintain your liver’s health (see also 
You will not be given ROCTAVIAN, above, and Other medicines and ROCTAVIAN and 
ROCTAVIAN with alcohol, below). 
* Your doctor may advise you against treatment with ROCTAVIAN if you have a liver disease 
that may prevent ROCTAVIAN from working well. </p>
<p>You may need to take an additional medicine 
* You may need to take another medicine (corticosteroids) for an extended period of time 
(2 months or longer) after being given ROCTAVIAN to manage problems with your liver seen 
in tests. Corticosteroids may cause side effects while you receive them. Your doctor may advise 
you to avoid or postpone treatment with ROCTAVIAN if you are not able to safely receive 
corticosteroids and may also advise you of steps you should take for safe use or may give you 
an alternative medicine. See also section 3.  </p>
<p>Side effects during or shortly after ROCTAVIAN infusion 
* Infusion-related side effects can occur during or shortly after you are given the ROCTAVIAN 
infusion (drip). Symptoms of such side effects are listed in section 4. Possible side effects. Tell 
your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience these or any other symptoms during or 
shortly after the infusion. Depending on your symptoms, your infusion may be slowed down or 
temporarily stopped, or you may be given medicines to treat them. Before you are discharged, 
your doctor will provide you with information on what to do in case you experience new side 
effects or side effects which come back once you leave the medical facility. </p>
<p>Possibility of unwanted blood clots when factor VIII levels improve 
* After treatment with ROCTAVIAN, your factor VIII protein level may increase. In some 
patients, it may increase to levels above the normal range for a period of time. </p>
<p>Factor VIII is the protein necessary to form stable clots in your blood. Depending on your 
individual risk factors, an improvement in factor VIII levels may mean an increased possibility 
of unwanted blood clots (so called “thromboses”, in either veins or arteries). Discuss with your 
doctor your general risk factors for unwanted clots and for cardiovascular disease, and what to 
do about them. Also ask how to recognise symptoms of unwanted clots and what to do if you 
think you may have one. </p>
<p>Avoiding blood donations and donations for transplantations 
* Do not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplant. </p>
<p>Immunocompromised patients or patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment 
* If you are immunocompromised (when your immune system’s ability to fight infections is 
reduced) or receiving immunosuppressive treatment, contact your doctor before starting 
treatment with ROCTAVIAN. You may need to be monitored more closely if your immune 
system is not working properly to ensure you can receive treatment and other medicines such as 
corticosteroids or if you need to change your existing medicines. </p>
<p>Receiving gene therapy again in the future 
* After receiving ROCTAVIAN, your immune system will produce antibodies to the shell of the 
AAV vector. It is not yet known whether or under which conditions therapy with ROCTAVIAN 
may be repeated. It is also not yet known whether or under which conditions subsequent use of 
another gene therapy may be possible. </p>
<p>Use of other haemophilia treatments 
* After ROCTAVIAN use, talk to your doctor about if or when you should stop your other 
haemophilia treatments and develop a treatment plan of what to do in case of surgery, trauma, 
bleeds, or any procedures that could potentially increase the risk of bleeding. It is very 
important to continue your monitoring and doctor visits to determine if you need to take other 
treatments to manage haemophilia. </p>
<p>Monitoring tests 
Before treatment with ROCTAVIAN, your doctor will perform tests to assess your liver health. </p>
<p>After treatment with ROCTAVIAN blood tests will be done to check: 
- when your liver starts producing factor VIII so you know when you can stop your regular 
treatment with factor VIII products, 
- how much factor VIII your liver produces on an ongoing basis, 
- how your liver cells react to the treatment with ROCTAVIAN, and 
- whether you develop inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) to factor VIII. </p>
<p>How often blood tests have to be done depends on how you react to ROCTAVIAN. In general, during 
the first 26 weeks after treatment, blood tests will be done every week, then every 2 to 4 weeks until 
the end of the first year. After the first year, blood tests will be done less frequently as advised by your 
doctor. It is important that you discuss the schedule for these blood tests with your doctor so that 
they can be carried out as necessary. </p>
<p>Because not all patients will respond to ROCTAVIAN and the reasons for this have not been 
established, your doctor will not be able to predict whether you will respond fully to the treatment. 
There is the potential that you may not benefit from ROCTAVIAN while still be exposed to long-term 
risks.  </p>
<p>If you respond to the treatment, it is unknown how long the treatment will last. A positive treatment 
effect of up to five years has been reported in some patients. </p>
<p>There are no plans to administer the medicine a second time for patients who do not respond or have 
lost the response. </p>
<p>Long-term follow-up tests may be required to verify a continued safe and effective response to 
ROCTAVIAN. </p>
<p>Risk of malignancy potentially associated with ROCTAVIAN 
* ROCTAVIAN can insert into liver cell DNA and there is the possibility that it can also insert 
into DNA of other body cells. As a consequence, ROCTAVIAN could contribute to a risk of 
cancer. Although there is no evidence of this in the clinical trials so far, this remains possible 
because of the nature of the medicine. You should therefore discuss this with your physician. 
After treatment with ROCTAVIAN, you will be recommended to enrol in a registry to help 
study the long-term safety of the treatment for 15 years, how well it continues to work and any 
side effects that may be linked to the treatment. In the event of cancer, your doctor may take a 
sample for further evaluation. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ROCTAVIAN is for use in adults only. ROCTAVIAN has not yet been tested for use in children or 
adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ROCTAVIAN 
Before and after treatment with ROCTAVIAN, tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or 
plan to use any other medicines, including herbal products or nutritional supplements. This is to make 
sure you avoid, as far as possible, taking anything that could damage your liver or impact the response 
to corticosteroids or ROCTAVIAN (such as isotretinoin, a medicine which is used to treat acne) or 
some medicines for the treatment of HIV (see section above on Immunocompromised patients or 
patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment). This is especially important during the first year 
after ROCTAVIAN treatment (see also Warnings and precautions). </p>
<p>As corticosteroids can affect the body’s immune (defence) system, your doctor may adjust the timing 
of vaccinations and may recommend you do not receive certain vaccinations while on corticosteroid 
treatment. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>ROCTAVIAN with alcohol 
Drinking alcohol could affect your liver’s ability to produce factor VIII after treatment with 
ROCTAVIAN. You should avoid alcohol for at least one year after treatment. Talk to your doctor 
about how much alcohol may be acceptable for you after the first year (see also Warnings and 
precautions). </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
ROCTAVIAN is not recommended in women who are able to become pregnant. It is not yet known 
whether ROCTAVIAN can be used safely in these patients as the effects on pregnancy and the unborn 
child are not known. It is also not known whether ROCTAVIAN passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>There is no information on the effect of ROCTAVIAN on male or female fertility. </p>
<p>Use of contraception and avoiding partner pregnancy for a period of time 
* After a male patient has been treated with ROCTAVIAN, the patient and any female partner 
must avoid pregnancy for 6 months. You should use effective contraception 
(e.g., double-barrier contraception such as condom and diaphragm). This is to prevent the 
theoretical risk that the factor VIII gene from a father’s ROCTAVIAN treatment is transmitted 
to a child with unknown consequences. For the same reason, male patients must not donate 
semen for 6 months. Discuss with your doctor which methods of contraception are suitable. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Temporary light-headedness (near-fainting), dizziness, tiredness, and headaches were observed after 
ROCTAVIAN infusion. If you are affected, you should use caution until you are certain that 
ROCTAVIAN does not adversely affect your ability to drive or use machines. Talk to your doctor 
about this. </p>
<p>ROCTAVIAN contains sodium 
This medicine contains 29 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. The 
amount of sodium you will receive depends on the number of ROCTAVIAN vials used for your 
infusion. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Treatment with ROCTAVIAN consists of one single infusion (drip) into a vein. The infusion may 
take several hours to be completed. </p>
<p>The infusion will be given to you in a medical facility. During and after the infusion, you will be

observation is not necessary. </p>
<p>Additional medicine you may need </p>
<p>You may need to take another medicine (corticosteroids) for an extended period of time (for example, 
2 months or longer) after ROCTAVIAN treatment to improve your response to therapy. It is important 
that you take this additional medicine according to the instructions given. You should read the package 
leaflet for any additional medicine you are prescribed and discuss with your doctor the possible side 
effects and any monitoring that may be needed. </p>
<p>If you are given more ROCTAVIAN than you should be 
As this medicine is given in hospital, and the dose is worked out and checked by your medical team, it 
is unlikely that you will be given too much. If you are given too much ROCTAVIAN, you might have 
higher factor VIII levels than needed, which may theoretically increase the possibility of unwanted 
blood clots. If this occurs, your doctor will treat you as necessary. </p>
