<p>Rolufta Ellipta contains the active substance umeclidinium (as bromide), which belongs to a group of 
medicines called bronchodilators. </p>
<p>What Rolufta Ellipta is used for </p>
<p>This medicine is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a 
long-term condition in which the airways and air-sacs in the lungs gradually become blocked or 
damaged, leading to breathing difficulties that slowly get worse. Difficulties in breathing is added to 
by tightening of the muscles around the airways, which narrows the airways and so restricts the flow 
of air. </p>
<p>This medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles, making it easier for air to get in and out of the 
lungs. When used regularly, it can help control your breathing difficulties and reduce the effects of 
COPD on your everyday life. </p>
<p>Rolufta Ellipta should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. 
If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). If you 
do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
