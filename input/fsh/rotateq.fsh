<li>What RotaTeq is and what it is used for
RotaTeq is an oral vaccine that helps protect infants and young children against gastroenteritis
(diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus infection and may be given to infants from the age of
6 weeks to 32 weeks (see section 3). The vaccine contains five types of live rotavirus strains. When an
infant is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defences) will make antibodies
against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies help protect against
gastroenteritis caused by these types of rotavirus.</li>

- your child developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of RotaTeq or other rotavirus

- your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of
bowel becomes enfolded within another segment).
- your child was born with a malformation of the gastrointestinal system that might predispose for
intussusception.
- your child has any disease which reduces his/her resistance to infection.
- your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone the
vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to
your doctor first.
- your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until
recovery.

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using RotaTeq if your child:
- has received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within the last 6 weeks.
- has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, e.g., a
person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system.
- has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system.
- has not been gaining weight and growing as expected.
- or the mother has taken any medicine during pregnancy that weakens the immune system.
After your child has received RotaTeq, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your
child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or
high fever (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”).
As always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies.<br />
As with other vaccines, RotaTeq may not completely protect all children who are vaccinated even
after all three doses have been given.<br />
If your child has already been infected with rotavirus but is not yet ill when vaccinated, RotaTeq may
not be able to prevent the illness. 
RotaTeq does not protect against diarrhoea and vomiting due to causes other than rotavirus. 
Other medicines and RotaTeq
RotaTeq may be given at the same time as your child receives other normally recommended
vaccinations, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b,
inactivated or oral poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, pneumococcal conjugate and meningococcus group C
conjugate vaccines.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other
medicines (or other vaccines).
RotaTeq with food and drink
There are no restrictions on taking food or liquid, including breast milk, either before or after
vaccination with RotaTeq. 
RotaTeq contains sucrose
If you have been told that your child has an intolerance to some sugars, inform your doctor/health care
professional before the vaccine is administered.<br />
RotaTeq contains sodium
This vaccine contains 37.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This is
equivalent to 1.88% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

A doctor or nurse will administer the recommended doses of RotaTeq to your child. The vaccine will
be given by gently squeezing the tube and delivering the vaccine into your child’s mouth. 
The vaccine can be given without regard to food, liquid, or breast milk. 
In case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be
given at the same vaccination visit. 
Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by injection. 
The first dose (2 ml) of RotaTeq may be given from the age of 6 weeks and should be given before
12 weeks of age (about 3 months). RotaTeq may be given to infants who were born early provided that
the pregnancy had lasted at least 25 weeks. These infants should receive the first dose of vaccine
between 6 and 12 weeks after birth.
Your child will receive 3 doses of RotaTeq given at least four weeks apart. It is important that your
child receives all 3 doses of the vaccine for protection against rotavirus. It is preferred that all three
doses should be given by the age of 20-22 weeks and at latest all three doses should be given by the
age of 32 weeks.
When RotaTeq is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives
RotaTeq (and not another rotavirus vaccine) to complete the vaccination course. 
If you forget an appointment for RotaTeq
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor/health care professional regarding your
child’s return visits for the follow-up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your
doctor/health care professional at the scheduled time, ask him or her for advice. </p>         </div>"""

them.<br />
Contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your child experiences one of the following

Allergic reactions (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data), which may be severe
(anaphylaxis), and may include: allergic swelling that may affect the face, lips, tongue or throat.

coughing or difficulty breathing.

Severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high fever.
These could be symptoms of a very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 infants), but serious, side
effect called intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of bowel becomes
enfolded within another segment).
The following other side effects reported with the use of RotaTeq were:
 Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 infants): fever, diarrhoea, vomiting
 Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 infants): infections of the upper respiratory system
26
 Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 infants): stomach pains (see also above for signs of a
very rare side effect of intussusception), runny nose and sore throat, ear infection, rash, blood
in stool
 Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 infants): hives
 Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): irritability
In babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between
breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination.
Ask your doctor/health care professional if you want more information about side effects for RotaTeq.<br />
