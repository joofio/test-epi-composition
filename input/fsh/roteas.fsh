form of irregular heart rhythm called nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and at least one additional 
risk factor, such as heart failure, previous stroke or high blood pressure; </li>
<li>treat blood clots in the veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels in

<li>if you have a disease or condition that increases the risk of serious bleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer,

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Roteas, 
- if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case if you have any of the following 
conditions: 
* endstage kidney disease or if you are on dialysis; 
* severe liver disease; 
* bleeding disorders; 
* a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy); 
* recent bleeding in your brain (intracranial or intracerebral bleeding); 
* problems with the blood vessels in your brain or spinal column; 
- if you have a mechanical heart valve. </p>

- if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk for blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed. </p>
<p>If you need to have an operation, 
- it is very important to take Roteas before and after the operation exactly at the times you have 
been told by your doctor. If possible, Roteas should be stopped at least 24 hours before an 
operation. Your doctor will determine when to restart Roteas. 
In emergency situations your physician will help determine the appropriate actions regarding 
Roteas. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Roteas is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Roteas </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If you are taking any of the following: 
* some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole); 
* medicines to treat abnormal heart beat (e.g. dronedarone, quinidine, verapamil); 
* other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. heparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K antagonists such 
as warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon or dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban); 
* antibiotic medicines (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin); 
* medicines to prevent organ rejection after transplantation (e.g. ciclosporin); 
* anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid); 
* antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Roteas, because these medicines 
may increase the effects of Roteas and the chance of unwanted bleeding. Your doctor will decide, if 
you should be treated with Roteas and if you should be kept under observation. </p>
<p>If you are taking any of the following: 
* some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital); 
* St John s Wort, a herbal product used for anxiety and mild depression; 
* rifampicin, an antibiotic medicine. 
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Roteas, because the effect of Roteas 
may be reduced. Your doctor will decide if you should be treated with Roteas and if you should be 
kept under observation. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not take Roteas if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you could become 
pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Roteas. If you become pregnant while you 
are taking Roteas, immediately tell your doctor, who will decide how you should be treated. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Roteas has no or negligible effects on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take Roteas. 
The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take it. If 
necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Roteas tablet through a tube via the nose 
(nasogastric tube) or a tube in the stomach (gastric feeding tube). </p>
<p>Your doctor may change your anticoagulant treatment as follows: </p>
<p>Changing from vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) to Roteas 
Stop taking the vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor will need to do blood measurements 
and will instruct you when to start taking Roteas. </p>
<p>Changing from non-VKA oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) to Roteas 
Stop taking the previous medicines (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) and start Roteas at the 
time of the next scheduled dose. </p>
<p>Changing from parenteral anticoagulants (e.g. heparin) to Roteas 
Stop taking the anticoagulant (e.g. heparin) and start Roteas at the time of the next scheduled 
anticoagulant dose. </p>
<p>Changing from Roteas to vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) 
If you currently take 60 mg Roteas: 
Your doctor will tell you to reduce your dose of Roteas to a 30 mg tablet once daily and to take it 
together with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor will need to do blood measurements 
and will instruct you when to stop taking Roteas. 
If you currently take 30 mg (dose reduced) Roteas: 
Your doctor will tell you to reduce your dose of Roteas to a 15 mg tablet once daily and to take it 
together with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor will need to do blood measurements 
and will instruct you when to stop taking Roteas. </p>
<p>Changing from Roteas to non-VKA oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) 
Stop taking Roteas and start the non-VKA anticoagulant (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) at 
the time of the next scheduled dose of Roteas. </p>
<p>Changing from Roteas to parenteral anticoagulants (e.g. heparin) 
Stop taking Roteas and start the parenteral anticoagulant (e.g. heparin) at the time of the next 
scheduled dose of Roteas. </p>
<p>Patients undergoing cardioversion: </p>
<p>If your abnormal heartbeat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take 
Roteas at the times your doctor tells you to prevent blood clots in the brain and other blood vessels in 
your body. </p>
<p>If you take more Roteas than you should </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Roteas tablets. 
If you take more Roteas than recommended, you may have an increased risk of bleeding. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Roteas </p>
<p>You should take the tablet immediately and then continue the following day with the once daily tablet 
as usual. Do not take a double dose on the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Roteas </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Roteas without talking to your doctor first, because Roteas treats and prevents 
serious conditions. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
