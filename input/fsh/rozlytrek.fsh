<p>Rozlytrek is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance entrectinib. </p>
<p>What Rozlytrek is used for </p>
<p>Rozlytrek is used to treat either: 
* adults and children 12 years of age and older with solid tumour (cancer) in various parts of the 
body that is caused by a change in the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene, or 
* adults with a type of lung cancer called  non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) that is caused by 
a change in the ROS1 gene. </p>
<p>NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumour cancer </p>
<p>It is used when: 
* a test has shown that your cancer cells have a change in genes called  NTRK  and has spread 
within the affected organ or to other organs in your body or if surgery to remove the cancer is 
likely to result in severe complications (see  How Rozlytrek works  below), and 
* you have not received treatment with medicines called NTRK inhibitors 
* other treatments have not worked or are not suitable for you. </p>
<p>ROS1-positive non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) </p>
<p>It is used if your lung cancer: 
* is  ROS1-positive    this means that your cancer cells have a change in a gene called  ROS1<br />
(see  How Rozlytrek works  below), 
* is advanced   for example, has spread to other parts of your body (metastatic), and 
* you have not received treatment with medicines called ROS1 inhibitors. </p>
<p>How Rozlytrek works </p>
<p>Rozlytrek works by blocking the action of abnormal enzymes caused by a change in the NTRK or 
ROS1 genes that make them. The faulty enzymes encourage the cancer cells to grow. </p>
<p>Rozlytrek may slow down or stop the cancer growing. It may also help to shrink your cancer. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Rozlytrek with food and drink </p>
<p>Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit or Seville oranges during your treatment with Rozlytrek. 
It may increase the amount of the medicine in your blood to a harmful level. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Women and contraception </p>
<p>You should not become pregnant while taking this medicine because it could harm the baby. If you are 
able to become pregnant, you must use highly effective contraception while on treatment and for at 
least 5 weeks after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>It is not known if Rozlytrek can reduce the effect of birth control medicines (pills or implanted 
hormonal contraceptives). You should use another reliable method of birth control such as a barrier 
method (e.g. condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking Rozlytrek and for 5 weeks 
after you stop treatment. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner. </p>
<p>Men and contraception </p>
<p>Your female partner should not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine because it could 
harm the baby. If your female partner is able to become pregnant, you must use highly effective 
contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. Talk to your 
doctor about the right methods of contraception for you and your partner. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take Rozlytrek if you are pregnant. This is because it may harm your baby. </li>
<li>If you become pregnant when taking the medicine or during the 5 weeks after taking your last 
dose, tell your doctor straight away. </li>
</ul>
<p>Breast-feeding  </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine. This is because it is not known if Rozlytrek can pass 
over into breast milk and could therefore harm your baby. </p>

<ul>
