<p>Rukobia is used with other anti-retroviral medicines (combination therapy), to treat HIV infection in 
adults with limited treatment options (other anti-retroviral medicines are not sufficiently effective or 
are not suitable). </p>
<p>Rukobia does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body and keeps it at a low 
level. Given HIV reduces the number of CD4 cells in your body, keeping HIV at a low level also 
increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that are important 
in helping your body fight infection. </p>         </div>"""

o medicines that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product for 
depression). 
 If you think any of these apply to you, do not take Rukobia until you have checked with your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Conditions you need to look out for<br />
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. 
These include:  </p>
<p>• infections and inflammation 
• joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Rukobia.<br />
 See Section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Before you take Rukobia your doctor needs to know 
* if you have or had a heart problem, or if you notice any unusual changes in your heart beat 
(such as beating too fast or too slow). Rukobia can affect heart rhythm. 
* if you have or had liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C. <br />
 Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. You may need extra check-ups, including blood tests, 
while you are taking your medicines. </p>
<p>You will need regular blood tests 
For as long as you are taking Rukobia, your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to measure the 
amount of HIV in your blood, and to check for side effects. There is more information about these side 
effects in Section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Stay in regular contact with your doctor 
Rukobia helps to control your condition, but it is not a cure for HIV infection. You need to keep taking 
it every day to stop your illness from getting worse. Because Rukobia does not cure HIV infection, 
you may still develop other infections and illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
 Keep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Rukobia without your doctor’s advice. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Rukobia is not recommended for people aged under 18 years because it has not been studied in this 
age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Rukobia<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, if you have taken any recently, 
or if you start taking new ones.  </p>
<p>Rukobia must not be taken with some other medicines </p>
<p>Do not take Rukobia if you are taking any of these medicines: 
* carbamazepine, or phenytoin, to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures 
* mitotane, to treat several types of cancer 
* enzalutamide, to treat prostate cancer 
* rifampicin, to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis 
* products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (an herbal product for 
depression). 
This medicine is not recommended with Rukobia: </p>
<p>• elbasvir/grazoprevir, to treat hepatitis C infection. </p>
<p> Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are being treated with this medicine. </p>
<p>Some medicines can affect how Rukobia works  </p>
<p>Or they can make it more likely that you will have side effects. Rukobia can also affect how some 
other medicines work. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines in the following list: 
* amiodarone, disopyramide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, or sotalol, used to treat heart 
conditions 
* statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin), used to lower 
cholesterol levels 
* ethinyl estradiol, used for birth control 
* tenofovir alafenamide, used as an antiviral. 
 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your doctor may decide to adjust 
your dose or that you need extra check-ups. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, or think you could be, or if you are planning to have a baby, do not take 
Rukobia without checking with your doctor. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefit and the 
risk to your baby of taking Rukobia while you’re pregnant. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.  </p>
<p>It is not known whether the ingredients of Rukobia can pass into breast milk and harm your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor 
as soon as possible.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Rukobia can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. 
Do not drive or use machines unless you are sure you are not affected. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everybody gets them, so it is very 
important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)<br />
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When they start treatment, the immune system 
becomes stronger, so the body starts to fight infections. 
Symptoms of infection and inflammation may develop, caused by either: 
• old, hidden infections flaring up again as the body fights them<br />
• the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). </p>
<p>The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to 
treat your HIV infection.  </p>
<p>Symptoms may include: 
• muscle weakness and/or pain 
• joint pain or swelling 
• weakness that starts in the hands and feet and moves up towards the trunk of the body 
• palpitations or tremor 
• excessive restlessness and movement (hyperactivity). </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the symptoms 
above: 
 Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without 
checking with your doctor. </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):<br />
* feeling sick (nausea) 
* diarrhoea 
* being sick (vomiting) 
* stomach pain (abdominal pain) 
* headache 
* rash. 
 Talk to your doctor if you get any side effects. </p>
<p>Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):<br />
* indigestion (dyspepsia) 
* lack of energy (fatigue) 
* disturbance in heart rhythm seen in ECG test (prolonged QT interval) 
* muscle pain (myalgia) 
* feeling drowsy (somnolence) 
* dizziness 
* taste disturbance (dysgeusia) 
* wind 
* difficulty sleeping (insomnia) 
* itching (pruritus). 
 Talk to your doctor if you get any side effects. </p>
<p>Some side effects may only be seen in your blood tests and may not appear immediately after you start 
taking Rukobia.  </p>
<p>Common side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
* increase in enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase, an indicator of 
muscle damage)<br />
* increase in creatinine, an indicator of how well your kidneys are working 
* increase in enzymes produced in the liver (transaminases, an indicator of liver damage). </p>
<p>Other side effects that may show up in blood tests<br />
Other side effects have occurred in some people but their exact frequency is unknown:  </p>
<ul>
<li>increase in bilirubin (a substance produced by the liver) in the blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
• if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
• if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
• if they drink alcohol 
• if their immune systems are very weak 
• if they are overweight. 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
• stiffness in the joints 
• aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
• difficulty moving. </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms: </p>
<p>→ Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety 
of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
