  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Ruxience is 
Ruxience contains the active substance  rituximab . This is a type of protein called a  monoclonal 
antibody . It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called  B-Lymphocyte . When 
rituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. </p>
<p>What Ruxience is used for 
Ruxience may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults and children. Your 
doctor may prescribe Ruxience for the treatment of: </p>
<p>a) 
Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma 
This is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell 
called B-Lymphocytes. 
In adults Ruxience can be given alone or with other medicines called  chemotherapy . 
In adult patients where the treatment is working, Ruxience may be used as a maintenance treatment for 
2 years after completing the initial treatment. 
In children and adolescents, Ruxience is given in combination with  chemotherapy . </p>
<p>b) 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects a 
particular lymphocyte, the B cell, which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph 
nodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone 
marrow and blood. The proliferation of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you 
may have. Ruxience in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually 
removed from the body by biological processes. </p>
<p>c) 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Ruxience is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease of the 
joints. B-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of some of the symptoms you have. Ruxience is used 
to treat rheumatoid arthritis in people who have already tried some other medicines which have either 
stopped working, have not worked well enough or have caused side effects. Ruxience is usually taken 
together with another medicine called methotrexate. </p>
<p>Ruxience slows down the damage to your joints caused by rheumatoid arthritis and improves your 
ability to do normal daily activities. </p>
<p>The best responses to Ruxience are seen in those who have a positive blood test to rheumatoid factor 
(RF) and/or anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP). Both tests are commonly positive in 
rheumatoid arthritis and aid in confirming the diagnosis. </p>
<p>d) 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis 
Ruxience is used for the treatment of adults and children 2 years of age and older with granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener s granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in 
combination with corticosteroids. </p>
<p>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the 
blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. B 
lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. </p>
<p>e) 
Pemphigus vulgaris<br />
Ruxience is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus 
vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of the mouth, 
nose, throat and genitals. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Ruxience 
* if you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
* if you have a severe active infection at the moment 
* if you have a weak immune system. 
* if you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have rheumatoid 
arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. </p>
<p>Do not have Ruxience if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before you are given Ruxience. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
It is important that you and your doctor record the brand name and batch number of your medication. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Ruxience if: </p>
<ul>
<li>you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, 
Ruxience could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. 
Patients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for 
signs of this infection </li>
<li>you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing 
problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Ruxience. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with 
Ruxience. </p>
<p>Also talk to your doctor if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including 
vaccinations needed to travel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time 
as Ruxience or in the months after you receive Ruxience. Your doctor will check if you should have 
any vaccines before you receive Ruxience. </p>
<p>If you have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or 
pemphigus vulgaris also tell your doctor 
* if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected 
by Ruxience help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you 
are given Ruxience. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or 
suffer from severe infections. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Non-Hodgkin s lymphoma 
Ruxience can be used for the treatment of children and adolescents, 6 months of age and older, with 
non-Hodgkin s lymphoma, specifically CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 
Burkitt lymphoma (BL)/Burkitt leukaemia (mature B-cell acute leukaemia) (BAL) or Burkitt-like 
lymphoma (BLL). </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are 
under 18 years of age.  </p>
<p>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis 
Ruxience can be used for treatment of children and adolescents, 2 years of age and older, with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener s granulomatosis) or microscopic 
polyangiitis. There is not much information about the use of rituximab in children and adolescents 
with other diseases. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are 
under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ruxience 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is 
because Ruxience can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can 
affect the way Ruxience works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor: 
* if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other 
medicines 12 hours before you are given Ruxience. This is because some people have a fall in 
their blood pressure while they are being given Ruxience. 
* if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system   such as chemotherapy or 
immune-suppressive medicines. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Ruxience. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are 
planning to become pregnant. This is because Ruxience can cross the placenta and may affect your 
baby. 
If you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while 
using Ruxience. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with Ruxience. 
Ruxience passes into breast milk in very small amounts. As the long-term effects on breastfed infants 
are not known, for precautionary reasons, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with 
Ruxience and for 6 months after the treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not known whether rituximab has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or 
machines. </p>
<p>Ruxience sodium content 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

effects. 
You will always be given Ruxience as a drip (intra-venous infusion). </p>
<p>Medicines given before each Ruxience administration 
Before you are given Ruxience, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or 
reduce possible side effects. </p>

<p>a) 
If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin s lymphoma 
* If you are having Ruxience alone 
Ruxience will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses with 
Ruxience are possible. 
* If you are having Ruxience with chemotherapy 
Ruxience will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given 
every 3 weeks up to 8 times.

your disease, your doctor will decide when you should receive more Ruxience. This may be months 
from now. </p>
<p>d) 
If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis 
Treatment with Ruxience uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will 
usually be given by injection before the start of Ruxience treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth 
may be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. </p>
<p>If you are 18 years of age and older and respond well to treatment, you may be given Ruxience as a 
maintenance treatment. This will be administered as 2 separate infusions which are given 2 weeks 
apart, followed by 1 infusion every 6 months for at least 2 years. Your doctor may decide to treat you 
longer with Ruxience (up to 5 years), depending on how you respond to the medicine.  </p>
<p>e) 
If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris<br />
Each course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. If you 
respond well to treatment, you may be given Ruxience as a maintenance treatment. This will be

<p>Most side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of 
these reactions have been fatal. </p>
<p>Infusion reactions 
During or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less 
frequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness (nausea), 
tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat discomfort, tongue 
or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number 
of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get worse. Tell the person 
giving you the infusion immediately if you or your child develops any of these symptoms, as the 
infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional treatment such as an 
antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can be 
continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion. Your doctor may decide 
to stop your Ruxience treatment if these reactions are serious. </p>
<p>Infections 
Tell your doctor immediately if you or your child gets signs of an infection including: 
* fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell 
* memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss   these may be due to a very rare, 
serious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or 
PML). 
* fever, headache and stiff neck, incoordination (ataxia), personality change, hallucinations, 
altered consciousness, seizures or coma   these may be due to a serious brain infection 
(enteroviral meningoencephalitis), which can be fatal. </p>
