Rybrevant is a cancer medicine. It contains the active substance  amivantamab , which is an antibody
(type of protein) designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body.
What Rybrevant is used for
Rybrevant is used in adults with a type of lung cancer called  non-small cell lung cancer . It is used 
when the cancer has spread to other parts of your body and has gone through certain changes (Exon insertion mutations) in a gene called  EGFR .
How Rybrevant works
The active substance in Rybrevant, amivantamab, targets two proteins found on cancer cells:</p>
<p>epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and</p>
<p>mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET).
This medicine works by attaching to these proteins. This may help to slow or stop your lung cancer 
from growing. It may also help to reduce the size of the tumour.</p>         </div>"""

<p>Any side effect while the medicine is being given into your vein.</p>
<p>Sudden difficulty in breathing, cough, or fever that may suggest inflammation of the lungs.</p>

this medicine. You will need to continue doing this for 2 months after you stop treatment.</p>
<p>Eye problems. If you have vision problems or eye pain contact your doctor or nurse straight 
away. If you use contact lenses and have any new eye symptoms, stop using contact lenses and 
tell your doctor straight away.

Other medicines and Rybrevant

treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. You and your doctor will 
decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your unborn baby.

this medicine. You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk 
to your baby.

If you feel tired, feel dizzy, or if your eyes are irritated or vision is affected after taking Rybrevant, do 
not drive or use machinery.
Rybrevant contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . However, before Rybrevant is given to you, it may be mixed with a solution that 
contains sodium. Talk to your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.</p>         </div>"""
