  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Ryeqo contains the active substances relugolix, estradiol and norethisterone acetate.  </p>
<p>It is used to treat<br />
- moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids (commonly known as myomas), which are 
non-cancerous tumours of the uterus (womb).<br />
- symptoms associated with endometriosis in women with a history of previous medical or 
surgical treatment for their endometriosis (endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which 
tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus - the endometrium - grows outside your uterus). </p>
<p>Ryeqo is used in adult women (over 18 years of age) before they reach menopause. </p>
<p>In some women, uterine fibroids may cause heavy menstrual bleeding (your  period ) and pelvic pain 
(pain below the belly button). Ryeqo is used for the treatment of your fibroids to stop or reduce 
bleeding and to decrease pain and pelvic discomfort associated with uterine fibroids.  </p>
<p>Women with endometriosis can experience pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pain with menstrual 
periods and pain with intercourse. Ryeqo is used for the treatment of endometriosis to decrease the 
symptoms due to displaced tissue of the lining of the womb. </p>
<p>This medicine contains relugolix, which blocks certain receptors in the brain and this reduces the 
production of hormones that in turn stimulate the ovaries to produce estradiol and progesterone. When 
blocked, the levels of estrogen and progesterone circulating in the body are reduced. This medicine 
also contains two types of female hormones, estradiol which belongs to a group of medicines called 
estrogens and norethisterone which belongs to a group of medicines called progestogens. The 
inclusion of these hormones in Ryeqo maintains a hormonal state similar to the beginning of your 
menstrual cycle and thus relieves your symptoms while helping to protect the strength of your bones.  </p>         </div>"""

Do not take Ryeqo if you have any of the conditions listed below.<br />
If you do have any of the conditions listed below, you must tell your doctor: </p>
<p>if you are allergic to relugolix, estradiol, norethisterone acetate or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>if you have or previously have had a blood clot in a blood vessel in the legs (deep vein 
thrombosis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), heart (heart attack), brain (stroke) or any other parts 
of the body. </p>
<p>if you have or previously have had a disease caused by blood clots in the arteries, such as a 
heart attack, stroke or angina. </p>
<p>if you have a blood clotting disorder (such as protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, 
antithrombin-III deficiency, or Factor V Leiden). </p>
<p>if you have osteoporosis. </p>
<p>if you suffer from headaches with focal neurological symptoms such as paralysis or loss of 
muscle control, or migraines with visual disturbance. </p>
<p>if you have any type of cancer which might be made worse by exposure to female sex 
hormones, such as cancer of the breast or the genital organs.  </p>
<p>if you have or ever had liver tumours. </p>
<p>if you have or ever had a liver disease and your liver function tests have not returned to 
normal. </p>
<p>if you are pregnant or if you think you might be pregnant or if you are breastfeeding. </p>
<p>if you have any genital bleeding of unknown origin. </p>
<p>if you are taking hormonal contraception (for example birth control pills) and unwilling to 
discontinue its use.  </p>
<p>If any of the above conditions appear for the first time while taking Ryeqo, stop taking it at once and 
consult your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you are not sure about any of the points above, talk to your doctor before taking Ryeqo. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ryeqo. </p>
<p>You should know that most women have reduced or no menstrual bleeding (period) during treatment 
and for a few weeks afterwards. </p>
<p>Your doctor will discuss your medical and family history with you. Your doctor will also need to 
check your blood pressure and make sure you are not pregnant. You may also need a physical 
examination and additional checks, such as breast examination and a scan to measure how strong your 
bones are, that will be specific to your medical needs and/or concerns. </p>
<p>Stop taking Ryeqo and get urgent medical attention if you notice: </p>
<p>any of the conditions mentioned in the  Do not take Ryeqo  section. </p>
<p>if you notice signs of liver disease: </p>
<p>yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice). </p>
<p>nausea or vomiting, fever, severe tiredness. </p>
<p>dark urine, itching or upper abdominal pain. </p>
<p>a large rise in your blood pressure (symptoms may be headache, tiredness, dizziness). </p>
<p>migraine for the first time or unusually bad headaches occurring more often than before. </p>
<p>if you notice possible signs of a blood clot that may mean you are suffering from a clot in the 
leg (i.e. deep vein thrombosis), or in the lung (i.e. pulmonary embolism), a heart attack or a 
stroke. For a description of the symptoms of these serious conditions please go to  Ryeqo and 
risk of blood clots . </p>
<p>if you become pregnant. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of the following conditions apply to you:  </p>
<p>if you have one or more of the risk factors for developing a blood clot listed below. </p>
<p>if you have high blood pressure. </p>
<p>if you have osteoporosis. </p>
<p>if you suffer from migraines. </p>
<p>if you think you might be pregnant. Treatment with Ryeqo usually leads to a significant 
reduction or may even stop your menstrual bleeding (your  period ), making it difficult to 
recognise pregnancy.  </p>
<p>if you have or previously suffered from depression. </p>
<p>if you have renal (kidney) disease. </p>
<p>Ryeqo and risk of blood clots 
The use of other medicines containing an estrogen and a progestogen increases the risk of blood clots. 
The risk of blood clots with Ryeqo has not been established. Ryeqo reduces the estrogen to levels 
similar to those at the beginning of your normal menstrual cycle. </p>
<p>Factors that can increase your risk of a blood clot in your vein and/or artery: </p>
<p>as you get older (particularly above about 35 year of age). </p>
<p>if you are overweight (body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2). </p>
<p>if you have had major surgery or prolonged time off your feet (e.g. your leg is in a cast). </p>
<p>if you have recently given birth.  </p>
<p>if anyone in your close family has had a blood clot in the leg, lung or other organ, a heart 
attack or a stroke at a young age (e.g. below the age of 50 years). </p>
<p>if you smoke. </p>
<p>if you have a problem with your heart (valve disorder, disturbance of the rhythm called atrial 
fibrillation). </p>
<p>if you have diabetes. </p>
<p>if you have certain medical conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE - a disease 
affecting your natural defence system), sickle cell disease (an inherited disease of the red blood 
cells), Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis (chronic inflammatory bowel diseases), or cancer. </p>
<p>The risk of developing a blood clot increases the more factors you have. </p>
<p>The symptoms of a blood clot will depend on where the blood clot has occurred. </p>
<p>Symptoms of a blood clot in your leg (deep vein thrombosis; DVT) 
The symptoms of a blood clot in the leg known as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can include: </p>
<p>swelling in your leg and/or foot or along a vein in your leg. </p>
<p>pain or tenderness in your leg which feels worse when you stand up or are walking. </p>
<p>increased heat in the affected leg with red or discoloured skin. </p>
<p>Symptoms of a blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolism; PE) 
The symptoms of a blood clot in the lung known as a pulmonary embolism (PE) can include: </p>
<p>a sudden onset of unexplained shortness of breath or rapid breathing. </p>
<p>sudden coughing which may be associated to a sharp pain in your chest. </p>
<p>coughing up of blood. </p>
<p>severe dizziness or feeling lightheaded. </p>
<p>a rapid or irregular heartbeat. </p>
<p>Symptoms of a heart attack 
The symptoms of a heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction, may be temporary and 
can include: </p>
<p>pain, discomfort, pressure, heaviness, sensation of squeezing or fullness in your chest, arm, or 
below your breastbone. </p>
<p>discomfort radiating to your back, jaw, throat, arm, stomach. </p>
<p>feeling of being full, having indigestion or choking. </p>
<p>sweating, nausea, vomiting or dizziness. </p>
<p>extreme weakness, anxiety, or shortness of breath. </p>
<p>rapid or irregular heartbeats. </p>
<p>Symptoms of a stroke 
The symptoms of a stroke can include: </p>
<p>a sudden numbness or weakness in your face, arm of leg, especially on one side of your body. </p>
<p>sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination. </p>
<p>sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding others. </p>
<p>sudden trouble seeing in one or both of your eyes. </p>
<p>sudden, severe or prolonged headache with no known cause. </p>
<p>loosing consciousness or fainting with or without a seizure. </p>
<p>Surgery 
If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon that you are taking Ryeqo. </p>
<p>Liver tumours or liver disease<br />
In rare cases liver tumours or liver disease has been reported in women taking estrogens and 
progestogens. If you experience any symptoms of jaundice contact your doctor for further 
medical advice. </p>
<p>Renal (kidney) impairment 
If you experience any decrease in urine production or notice any fluid retention causing swelling in 
your legs, ankles or feet, please contact your doctor for further medical advice. </p>
<p>Change in menstrual bleeding pattern (your  period ) 
Treatment with Ryeqo usually leads to a significant reduction or may even stop your menstrual 
bleeding (your  period ) within the first 30 days of treatment. However, if you continue to experience 
excessive bleeding, tell your doctor.  </p>
<p>Depression 
If you experience mood changes or any depressive symptoms contact your doctor for further 
medical advice. </p>
<p>Increased blood pressure<br />
In rare cases treatment with Ryeqo may lead to small increases in blood pressure. If you experience 
any symptoms of increased blood pressure, contact your doctor for further medical advice. </p>
<p>Uterine fibroid prolapse and expulsion 
Uterine fibroids may develop anywhere within the muscular wall of the uterus, including the 
submucosa, a thin layer of tissue in the uterus. In some women, the uterine fibroid may protrude or slip 
through the cervix into the vagina and may lead to significant worsening of uterine bleeding or pain. 
If you re-experience severe uterine bleeding after your symptoms have improved while being treated 
with Ryeqo, contact your doctor for medical advice.  </p>
<p>Gallbladder disorders 
Some women taking estrogen and progestogen hormones including Ryeqo have reported gallbladder 
disorders (gallstones or inflammation of your gallbladder). If you experience unusually severe pain 
below your rib cage or in your upper abdomen contact your doctor for medical advice. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Ryeqo should not be taken by children under 18 years of age since the safety and efficacy of Ryeqo 
has not been established in this age group.<br />
Other medicines and Ryeqo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as these medicines can affect 
Ryeqo or be affected by Ryeqo: </p>
<p>Certain medicines used to treat epilepsy (e.g. carbamazepine, topiramate, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, primidone, oxcarbazepine, felbamate). </p>
<p>Certain medicines used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection/ acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (e.g. ritonavir, efavirenz). </p>
<p>Certain medicines used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (e.g. boceprevir, sofosbuvir, 
velpatasvir, voxilaprevir, telaprevir, glecaprevir). </p>
<p>Certain medicines used to treat fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, 
griseofulvin). </p>
<p>Certain medicines used to treat bacterial infections (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, clarithromycin, 
erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, griseofulvin). </p>
<p>Certain medicine used to treat high blood pressure in the arteries in the lung (e.g. bosentan). </p>

<p>Certain medicines to prevent organ rejection after transplantion (e.g. cyclosporine). </p>
<p>Herbal remedies containing St John s wort (Hypericum perforatum).  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Ryeqo if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. If you become 
pregnant, stop taking Ryeqo and contact your doctor.  </p>
<p>Ryeqo stops ovulation and thus you are not likely to become pregnant while using Ryeqo if used as 
recommended. Ovulation and menstrual bleeding will return rapidly after discontinuing Ryeqo and 
alternative birth control needs to be started immediately after discontinuation of Ryeqo. </p>
<p>Depending on when in your cycle you start taking Ryeqo, it may take time to obtain the full inhibition 
of ovulation by Ryeqo; therefore, nonhormonal birth control (e.g. condoms) should be used for the 
first month after starting Ryeqo. </p>
<p>If you miss two or more tablets in a row, nonhormonal birth control (e.g. condoms) should be used for 
the next 7 days of treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ryeqo has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>Laboratory tests 
If you need a blood or urine test, tell your doctor or the laboratory staff that you are taking Ryeqo 
because this medicine can affect the results of some tests. </p>
<p>Ryeqo contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.  </p>         </div>"""
