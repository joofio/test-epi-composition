<p>Rystiggo contains the active substance rozanolixizumab. Rozanolixizumab is a monoclonal antibody 
(a type of protein) designed to recognise and attach to FcRn, a protein that keeps the immunoglobulin 
G (IgG) antibodies in the body for longer.  </p>
<p>Rystiggo is used together with standard therapy in adults to treat generalised myasthenia gravis 
(gMG), an autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness which can affect multiple muscle groups 
throughout the body. The condition can also lead to shortness of breath, extreme fatigue and 
difficulties swallowing. Rystiggo is used in adults with gMG that produces IgG autoantibodies against 
acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase. </p>
<p>In generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG), these IgG autoantibodies (proteins of the immune system 
that attack parts of a person s own body) attack and damage proteins that are involved in 
communication between nerves and muscle, called acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase. 
By attaching to FcRn, Rystiggo reduces the level of IgG antibodies, including IgG autoantibodies, 
thereby helping to improve symptom of the disease. </p>         </div>"""

Your doctor may not prescribe this medicine if you are, or are likely to be, on a ventilator due to gMG 
muscle weakness (myasthenic crisis). </p>
<p>Inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (aseptic meningitis) 
Aseptic meningitis has been observed in association with this medicine at a higher dose. Seek 
immediate medical attention if you develop symptoms of aseptic meningitis such as severe headache, 
fever, stiffness of the neck, nausea, vomiting and/or intolerance to bright light. </p>
<p>Infections 
This medicine may reduce your natural resistance to infections. Before starting or during treatment 
with this medicine, inform your doctor if you have any symptoms of infection (feeling warm, fever, 
chills or shivering, cough, sore throat or fever blisters may be signs of an infection). </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity (allergic reactions) 
This medicine contains a protein that can cause reactions such as rash, swelling or itching in some 
people. You will be monitored for signs of an infusion reaction during and for 15 minutes after

<p>Other medicines and Rystiggo </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Taking Rystiggo with other medicines may decrease the effectiveness of those medicines, including 
therapeutic antibodies (such as rituximab) or subcutaneous or intravenous immunoglobulins. Other 
medicines, including subcutaneous or intravenous immunoglobulins, or interventions such as 
plasmapheresis (a process in which the liquid part of the blood, or plasma, is separated from blood that 
has been drawn from a person), may impair the effect of Rystiggo. Tell your doctor if you are taking 
or planning to take other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor about your treatment with Rystiggo before you have a vaccination. This medicine 
may impair the effect of vaccines. Vaccination with so-called live-attenuated or live vaccines is not 
recommended during treatment with Rystiggo. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>The effects of this medicine in pregnancy are not known. You should not use this medicine if you are 
pregnant or think that you may be pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. </p>

should breast-feed and use Rystiggo. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Rystiggo is not likely to affect your driving and use of machines. </p>
<p>Rystiggo contains proline </p>
<p>This medicine contains 29 mg of proline in each ml of medicine. 
Proline may be harmful for patients with hyperprolinaemia, a rare genetic disorder in which an excess 
of the amino acid, proline, builds up in the body. 
If you have hyperprolinaemia, tell your doctor and do not use this medicine unless your doctor has 
recommended it.  </p>         </div>"""
