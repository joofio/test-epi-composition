  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Saphnelo is 
Saphnelo contains the active substance anifrolumab, a  monoclonal antibody  (a type of specialised 
protein that attaches to a specific target in the body).
What Saphnelo is used for
Saphnelo is used to treat moderate to severe lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) in adults 
whose disease is not well controlled by standard therapies ( oral corticosteroids , 
 immunosuppressants  and/or  antimalarials ).
You will be given Saphnelo as well as your standard therapy for lupus.
Lupus is a disease in which the system that fights infections (the immune system) attacks your own 
cells and tissues. This causes inflammation and organ damage. It can affect almost any organ in the 
body, including skin, joints, kidneys, brain and other organs. It can cause pain, rashes, swelling in 
joints, fevers and make you feel very tired or weak.
How Saphnelo works
People with lupus have high levels of proteins called  type I interferons  which stimulate the activity 
of the immune system. Anifrolumab attaches to a target (receptor) that these proteins act on, stopping 
them from working. Blocking their action in this way can reduce the inflammation in your body that 
causes the signs of lupus.
The benefits of using Saphnelo
Saphnelo may help to reduce your lupus disease activity and reduce the number of lupus flares you 
have. If you are taking medicines called  oral corticosteroids , using Saphnelo may also allow your 
doctor to reduce the daily dose of oral corticosteroids that is needed to help control your lupus.</p>         </div>"""
