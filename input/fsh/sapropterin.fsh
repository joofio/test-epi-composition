  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Sapropterin Dipharma contains the active substance sapropterin which is a synthetic copy of a body s 
own substance called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is required by the body to use an amino acid 
called phenylalanine in order to build another amino acid called tyrosine. </p>
<p>Sapropterin Dipharma is used to treat hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) or phenylketonuria (PKU) in 
patients of all ages. HPA and PKU are due to abnormally high levels of phenylalanine in the blood 
which can be harmful. Sapropterin Dipharma reduces these levels in some patients who respond to 
BH4 and can help increase the amount of phenylalanine that can be included in the diet. </p>
<p>This medicine is also used to treat an inherited disease called BH4 deficiency in patients of all ages, in 
which the body cannot produce enough BH4. Because of very low BH4 levels phenylalanine is not 
used properly and its levels rise, resulting in harmful effects. By replacing the BH4 that the body 
cannot produce, Sapropterin Dipharma reduces the harmful excess of phenylalanine in the blood and 
increases the dietary tolerance to phenylalanine. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sapropterin Dipharma, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are 65 years of age or older </li>
<li>if you have problems with your kidney or liver </li>
<li>if you are ill. Consultation with a physician is recommended during illness as blood 
phenylalanine levels may increase </li>
<li>if you have predisposition to convulsions </li>
</ul>
<p>When you are treated with Sapropterin Dipharma, your doctor will test your blood to verify how much 
phenylalanine and tyrosine it contains and may decide to adjust the dose of Sapropterin Dipharma or 
your diet if needed. </p>
<p>You must continue your diet treatment as recommended by your doctor. Do not change your diet 
without contacting your doctor. Even if you take Sapropterin Dipharma, if your phenylalanine blood 
levels are not well controlled, you can develop severe neurologic problems. Your doctor should 
continue to monitor your blood phenylalanine levels often during your treatment with Sapropterin 
Dipharma, to make sure that your blood phenylalanine levels are not too high or too low. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sapropterin Dipharma 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using:</p>
<ul>
<li>levodopa (used to treat Parkinson s disease) </li>
<li>medicines for treatment of cancer (e.g. methotrexate) </li>
<li>medicines for treatment of bacterial infections (e.g. trimethoprim) </li>
<li>medicines that cause dilation of blood vessels, (such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide 
dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), molsidomin, minoxidil). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant your doctor will tell you how to control phenylalanine levels adequately. If these 
are not strictly controlled before or when you become pregnant, this could be harmful to you and to 
your baby. Your doctor will monitor the restriction of dietary phenylalanine intake prior and during 
pregnancy. </p>
<p>If the strict diet does not adequately reduce phenylalanine amount in your blood your doctor will 
consider whether you must take this medicine. </p>
<p>You should not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Sapropterin Dipharma is not expected to affect the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Sapropterin Dipharma contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

The recommended starting dose of Sapropterin Dipharma in patients with PKU is 10 mg for each kg 
of body weight. Take Sapropterin Dipharma as a single daily dose with a meal to increase the 
absorption, and at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. Your doctor may adjust your 
dose, usually between 5 and 20 mg for each kg of body weight per day, depending on your condition. </p>
<p>Dosing for BH4 deficiency 
The recommended starting dose of Sapropterin Dipharma in patients with BH4 deficiency is 2 to 5 mg 
for each kg of body weight. Take Sapropterin Dipharma with a meal to increase the absorption. Divide 
the total daily dose into 2 or 3 doses, taken over the day. Your doctor may adjust your dose up to

<p>Use in all patients 
Place the prescribed number of tablets in a glass or cup of water as accurately described below and stir 
until dissolved. </p>
<p>It may take a few minutes for the tablets to dissolve. To make the tablets dissolve faster you can crush 
them. Small particles may be visible in the solution, but they will not affect the effectiveness of the 
medicine. 
Drink the dissolved preparation of Sapropterin Dipharma with a meal within 15 to 20 minutes of its 
preparation.  </p>
<p>Use in patients above 20 kg body weight 
Place the tablets in a glass or cup (120 to 240 ml) of water and stir until dissolved. </p>
<p>Use in children up to 20 kg body weight 
The dose is based on body weight. This will change as your child grows. Your doctor will tell you: </p>
<ul>
<li>the number of Sapropterin Dipharma tablets needed for one dose </li>
<li>the amount of water needed to mix one dose of Sapropterin Dipharma </li>
<li>the amount of solution you will need to give your child for their prescribed dose. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your child should drink the solution with a meal. </p>
<p>Give your child the prescribed amount of solution within 15 to 20 minutes after dissolving. If you are 
not able to give your child s dose within 15 to 20 minutes after dissolving the tablets, you will need to 
prepare a new solution as the unused solution should not be used beyond 20 minutes. </p>
<p>Supplies needed to prepare and give your child s dose of Sapropterin Dipharma 
* The number of Sapropterin Dipharma tablets needed for one dose 
* A medicine cup with graduation markings at 20, 40, 60 and 80 ml 
* A glass or cup 
* Small spoon or clean utensil for stirring 
* Oral syringe (graduated in 1 ml divisions) (10 ml syringe for administration of volumes of 
  10 ml or 20 ml syringe for administration of volumes of &gt; 10 ml) </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for the medicine cup for dissolving the tablets and the 10 ml or 20 ml oral syringe if 
you do not have these supplies. </p>
<p>Steps for preparing and taking your dose: 
* Place the prescribed number of tablets in the medicine cup. Pour the amount of water into the 
medicine cup, as instructed by your doctor (e.g. your doctor told you to use 20 ml for dissolving 
one Sapropterin Dipharma tablet). Check to make sure that the amount of liquid lines up with 
the amount that your doctor tells you. Stir with the small spoon or clean utensil until the tablets 
dissolve. 
* If your doctor told you to administer only a portion of the solution, point the tip of the oral 
syringe into the medicine cup. Slowly pull back the plunger to withdraw the amount as 
instructed by your doctor. 
* Transfer the solution by pushing on the plunger slowly until all of the solution in the oral 
syringe is transferred to a glass or cup for administration (e.g. if your doctor told you to dissolve 
two Sapropterin Dipharma tablets in 40 ml water and administer 30 ml to your child, you would 
have to use the 20 ml oral syringe two times to draw up 30 ml (e.g. 20 ml + 10 ml) of the 
solution and transfer it to a glass or cup for administration). Use a 10 ml oral syringe for 
administration of volumes   10 ml or a 20 ml oral syringe for administration of volumes </p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 ml. 
* If your baby is too small to drink from a glass or a cup you may administer the solution via the 
oral syringe. Draw up the prescribed volume from the solution prepared in the medicine cup and 
place the tip of the oral syringe into your baby s mouth. Point the tip of the oral syringe towards 
either cheek. Push on the plunger slowly, a small amount at a time, until all of the solution in 
the oral syringe is given. 
* Throw away any remaining solution. Remove the plunger from the barrel of the oral syringe. 
Wash both parts of the oral syringe and the medicine cup with warm water and air dry. When 
the oral syringe is dry, put the plunger back into the barrel. Store the oral syringe and the 
medicine cup for next use. </p>
