vein into the surrounding tissue. This event is called extravasation. It is a serious complication as it 
can cause severe tissue damage. </p>

<li>If you are breast-feeding </li>
<li>If you are given yellow-fever vaccine </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Savene:</p>
<ul>
<li>Savene should only be given to you if you have an extravasation in connection with 
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. </li>
<li>During treatment with Savene the area where the extravasation has occurred will be examined 
on a regular basis and you will have blood tests taken regularly to check your blood cells. </li>
<li>If you have liver problems, your doctor will monitor your liver function during treatment. </li>
<li>If you have kidney problems, your doctor will monitor for signs of changes to your blood cells. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Savene should not be administered to children below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Savene 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or may take any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccines: you must not use Savene if you are going to receive yellow fever vaccine and it is not 
recommended that you use Savene if you are going to receive a vaccine containing live virus 
particles. </li>
<li>A product called DMSO (which is a cream to treat some skin diseases). </li>
<li>Phenytoin (a treatment against seizures) (Savene may reduce the effectiveness of this medicine). </li>
<li>Anticoagulants (blood thinners) (your blood may need to be monitored more frequently). </li>
<li>Ciclosporin or tacrolimus (both treatments lower the body's immune system and are used to 
prevent organ rejection after an organ transplant). </li>
<li>Myelosuppressive medicines (decrease production of red, white, or coagulating blood cells). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Savene should not be administered if you are pregnant.<br />
You must not breast-feed while you are treated with Savene. 
If you are sexually active, you are advised to use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy during 
and for six months after treatment, whether you are male or female  (see section 2  Do not use 
Savene ). 
There is limited information about the effect of Savene on fertility   if you have a concern about this 
speak to you doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness, tiredness and sudden fainting have been reported in a few patients treated with Savene. The 
treatment is considered to have a limited influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Savene contains potassium and sodium 
The Savene solvent contains 98 mg potassium in each 500 ml bottle which may be harmful to people 
on a low-potassium diet or who have kidney problems. If you are at risk of high potassium levels in 
your blood, your doctor will monitor this. 
Savene solvent also contains 1.61 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 500 ml 
bottle.  This is equivalent to 81% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. </p>         </div>"""

soon as possible and within the first six hours after extravasation of an anthracycline medicine. Savene 
infusion will be given at the same time every day of your treatment. 
Savene will not be used again at the time of your next anthracycline cycle, except if extravasation 
occurs again. </p>
<p>If you receive more Savene than you should 
If you receive more Savene than you should, you will be closely monitored with specific attention to 
your blood cells, potential gastro-intestinal signs, skin reactions and hair loss.  </p>

<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only. </p>
<p>Preparation guide for use with Savene 20 mg/ml powder and solvent for concentrate for solution 
for infusion </p>
<p>It is important that you read the entire content of this procedure prior to the preparation of Savene. </p>
<ol>
<li>FORMULATION </li>
</ol>
<p>Savene is supplied as: 
1. Savene powder for concentrate 
2. Solvent for Savene </p>
<p>Savene powder must be reconstituted in 25 ml Savene solvent to obtain a concentrate that must be 
further diluted in the remaining Savene solvent prior to administration. </p>
<ol>
<li>RECOMMENDATION FOR THE SAFE HANDLING </li>
</ol>
<p>Savene is an anti-cancer agent and the normal procedures for proper handling and disposal of anti-
cancer medicines should be adopted, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personnel should be trained to reconstitute the medicine </li>
<li>Pregnant staff should be excluded from working with this medicine </li>
<li>Personnel handling this medicine during reconstitution should wear protective clothing 
including mask, goggles and gloves </li>
<li>
<p>Accidental contact with the skin or eyes should be treated immediately and thoroughly with 
copious amounts of water </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3.1 
Reconstitution of Savene powder to prepare a concentrate 
3.1.1 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, withdraw aseptically 25 ml from the Savene solvent bottle. 
3.1.2 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the vial containing the Savene powder. 
3.1.3  Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions until the powder is 
fully dissolved. Do not shake. 
3.1.4  Allow the vial with the concentrate to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature and check if the 
solution is homogenous and clear. The concentrate is slightly yellow. </p>
<p>The concentrate contains 20 mg dexrazoxane per ml and should be used immediately for further 
dilution. It contains no antibacterial preservative. 
3.1.5 Keep and store the opened solvent bottle under aseptic conditions because it is needed for 
dilution of the concentrate. </p>
<p>3.2 
Dilution of the concentrate 
3.2.1 Up to four vials containing Savene concentrate may be necessary to obtain the required dose for 
the patient. Based on the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, withdraw aseptically the 
corresponding volume containing 20 mg dexrazoxane per ml from the appropriate number of 
vials containing concentrate. Use a graduated syringe filled with a needle. 
3.2.2 Inject the required volume back into the opened Savene solvent bottle (see point 3.1.5). The 
solution must not be mixed with any other medicines. 
3.2.3 Mix the solution by agitating gently the infusion bottle. 
3.2.4 Savene should be administered aseptically as a 1-2 hours infusion under room temperature and 
normal light conditions. 
3.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Savene concentrate and infusion solution should be inspected 
visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Solutions containing a 
precipitate should be discarded. </p>
<ol>
<li>STORAGE </li>
</ol>
<p>4.1 
Before reconstitution and dilution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store below 25  C. </li>
<li>Keep the powder vials and solvent bottles in the outer carton in order to protect from light. </li>
</ul>
<p>4.2 
After reconstitution and dilution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemical and physical in-use stability after reconstitution and subsequent dilution in the solvent 
has been demonstrated for 4 hours when stored at 2 to 8  C. </li>
<li>In order to avoid the potential contamination of the medicine by microbes, the product should 
be used immediately. </li>
<li>
<p>If the medicine is not used immediately, it should be kept at a temperature of 2 to 8  C (in the 
refrigerator) and no longer than 4 hours. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DISPOSAL </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All items for preparation, administration or cleaning, including gloves, as well as liquid waste should 
be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. </p>         </div>"""
