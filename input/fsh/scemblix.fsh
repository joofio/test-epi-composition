Scemblix contains the active substance asciminib, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
protein kinase inhibitors. </p>
<p>What Scemblix is used for 
Scemblix is a cancer medicine used to treat adults with a type of blood cancer (leukaemia) called 
Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP). It is 
given to patients who were previously treated with two or more cancer medicines called tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors. </p>
<p>How Scemblix works 
In Ph+ CML, the body produces large numbers of abnormal white blood cells. Scemblix blocks the 
action of a protein (BCR::ABL1) that is produced by these abnormal white blood cells and stops their 
division and growth. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how this medicine works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to asciminib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Scemblix if any of the following applies to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have ever had severe upper stomach pain that could be due to problems with your 
pancreas (inflamed pancreas, pancreatitis). </li>
<li>if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Scemblix could 
cause hepatitis B to become active again. You will be carefully checked by your doctor for signs 
of this infection before treatment is started. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you get any of the following during treatment 
with Scemblix:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you experience weakness, spontaneous bleeding or bruising and frequent infections with signs 
such as fever, chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers. These can be signs of decreased bone marrow 
activity, resulting in myelosuppression (a reduction in the number of white blood cells, red 
blood cells and platelets). </li>
<li>if blood tests show that you have high levels of enzymes called lipase and amylase (signs of 
damage to the pancreas, also known as pancreatic toxicity). </li>
<li>if you have a heart disorder or a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or an 
abnormal electrical activity of the heart called QT interval prolongation that can be seen on an 
electrocardiogram (ECG). </li>
<li>if blood tests show that you have a low level of potassium or magnesium (hypokalaemia or 
hypomagnesaemia). </li>
<li>if you are being treated with medicines that may have an unwanted effect on the function of the 
heart (torsades de pointes) (see  Other medicines and Scemblix ). </li>
<li>if you experience headache, dizziness, chest pain or shortness of breath (possible signs of high 
blood pressure, also known as hypertension). </li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring during your treatment with Scemblix 
Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired 
effect. You will have regular tests including blood tests during treatment. These tests will monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets). </li>
<li>the levels of pancreas enzymes (amylase and lipase). </li>
<li>the levels of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium). </li>
<li>your heart rate and blood pressure. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents aged under 18 years. </p>

<ul>
<li>medicines usually used to treat seizures (fits), such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital or 
phenytoin. </li>
<li>medicines used to treat pain and/or as sedatives before or during medical or surgical procedures, 
such as alfentanil or fentanyl. </li>
<li>medicines used to treat migraine or dementia, such as dihydroergotamine or ergotamine. </li>
<li>medicines that may have an unwanted effect on the electrical activity of the heart (torsades de 
pointes), such as bepridil, chloroquine, clarithromycin, halofantrine, haloperidol, methadone, 
moxifloxacin or pimozide. </li>
<li>medicines used to reduce the blood s ability to clot, such as warfarin. </li>
<li>medicines used to treat severe inflammation of the bowel or severe rheumatic joint 
inflammation, such as sulfasalazine. </li>

methotrexate. </li>
<li>medicines used to reduce blood cholesterol levels, such as pravastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, 
rosuvastatin and simvastatin. </li>
