  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>SCENESSE contains the active substance afamelanotide (as acetate). Afamelanotide is a synthetic 
form of a body hormone called alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( -MSH). Afamelanotide 
works in a way similar to the natural hormone, by making skin cells produce eumelanin which is a 
brown-black type of melanin pigment in the body. </p>
<p>Afamelanotide is used to increase the tolerance to sunlight in adults with a confirmed diagnosis of 
erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). EPP is a condition in which patients have an increased sensitivity 
to sunlight, which can cause toxic effects such as pain and burning. By increasing the amount of 
eumelanin, SCENESSE can help to delay the onset of pain due to skin photosensitivity (sensitive to 
sunlight). </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to afamelanotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you have any severe condition of the liver. </li>
<li>if you have liver problems. </li>
<li>if you have kidney problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before receiving SCENESSE if you have or have ever had:</p>
<ul>
<li>heart problems or severe breathing problems; </li>
<li>gastrointestinal problems; </li>
<li>diabetes; </li>
<li>Cushing s disease (a hormone disorder where the body produces too much of the hormone 
cortisol); </li>
<li>Addison s disease (a disorder of the adrenal glands causing a lack of some hormones); </li>
<li>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (a disorder that causes blockage of the bowel and where your hands, 
soles of your feet and surface of your lips may have brown freckles); </li>
<li>epilepsy (or have been told that you are at risk of having fits); </li>
<li>anaemia (low counts of red blood cells in your blood); </li>
<li>melanoma (an aggressive type of skin cancer), including in-situ melanoma, e.g. lentigo maligna; 
or if you have certain inherited conditions that increase the risk of developing a melanoma; </li>
<li>skin cancer of the types, basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (inclusive of 
carcinoma in situ, e.g. Bowen s disease), Merkel cell carcinoma or other malignant or 
premalignant skin problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor before receiving SCENESSE if you are over 70 years of age. </p>
<p>If you have ever had any of these conditions your doctor may have to monitor you more closely during 
your treatment. </p>
<p>Sun protection </p>
<p>Do not change the sun protection measures you normally follow to manage your EPP and according to 
your skin phototype (UV sensitivity). Keep in mind that increased exposure to UV light will contribute 
to skin cancer development. </p>
<p>Skin monitoring </p>
<p>Because this medicine increases eumelanin, in most treated patients the skin will darken. This is an 
expected response to this medicine, and the darkening will slowly fade unless another implant is used. </p>
<p>Your doctor will need to regularly check your skin (full body) to monitor changes in moles (e.g. 
darkening) or other skin abnormalities. This is recommended to be performed every 6 months. </p>
<p>Please inform your doctor about new or changing skin abnormalities. Arrange for an early 
appointment with your porphyria specialist if pigmented lesions like moles grow or if other growing, 
non-healing, weeping, plaque-like, wart-like, or ulcerated lesions appear. A referral to a dermatology 
specialist might be necessary. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been tested in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and SCENESSE </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking anticoagulant medicines used to prevent blood clots. These may 
include warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and 
lower fever or to prevent blood clotting) and a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), used to treat common ailments, such as arthritis, headaches, mild fever, 
rheumatism and sore throats. This is because patients taking such medicines may experience increased 
bruising or bleeding at the site of the implant. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, you 
should not receive SCENESSE, since it is not known how it will affect your unborn baby or the 
breastfed infant. </p>
<p>Women who could become pregnant should use adequate contraception such as oral contraceptives, 
diaphragm plus spermicide, intrauterine device (also known as a coil) during treatment and for three 
months after the last SCENESSE implantation. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>There is a risk of feeling drowsy and tired when using this medicine, especially within 72 hours of 
administration. If you are affected, do not drive or use any tools or machines. If you suffer from 
continued drowsiness, then you should speak to your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

doctor will decide with you the most suitable time and the site for inserting the implant. </p>
<p>One implant is injected every 2 months during the spring and summer months. Three implants per year 
are recommended, depending on the length of effect required. However, this number should not 
exceed more than 4 per year. </p>
<p>The implant is given as injection under your skin using a catheter tube and needle (subcutaneous use). 
Before inserting this medicine, your doctor may decide to give you a local anaesthetic to numb the 
area where the implant is to be inserted. The implant is inserted directly under the skin folds on your 
waist or abdomen in an area known as the supra-iliac crest. </p>
<p>At the end of the insertion procedure, you may be able to feel the implant under your skin. Over time 
the implant will be absorbed by the body, this will happen within 50 to 60 days after implantation. </p>
<p>If you experience discomfort and are concerned, speak to your doctor. The implant may be removed 
by a simple surgical procedure if needed. </p>
