granulocytes (a type of white blood cells involved in the inflammation process) in your body. 
Scintimun is used for the preparation of a radioactive solution for injection of technetium(99mTc)-
besilesomab. Technetium(99mTc) is a radioactive element allowing the organs where besilesomab 
accumulates to be seen using a special camera. </p>
<p>This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only in adults. 
After injection into your vein, your doctor can obtain pictures (scans) of your organs that give more 
information about the detection of sites of inflammation and/or infection. However Scintimun should 
not be used for the diagnosis of diabetic foot infection. 
The use of Scintimun does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the 
procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweights the risk due to radiation. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to besilesomab, to antibody from mouse origin or any other antibodies, or to 
sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) solution or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you have a positive response to a test detecting human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA test). 
Ask your doctor if you are not sure. </li>
<li>if you are pregnant. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to the nuclear medicine specialist before using Scintimun:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have previously been administered Scintimun, because you should only be administered 
Scintimun once in your lifetime. If you are not sure if you have been given this medicine before, 
please let your doctor know. </li>
<li>if you have had a scintigraphy with technetium in the last 2 days. </li>
<li>if you have a tumoral pathology involving a secretion of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) 
which could interfere with this investigation. </li>
<li>if you have any blood disease. </li>
<li>if you are breast-feeding. </li>
</ul>
<p>Before administration of Scintimun 
In order to obtain images of best quality and to reduce the radiation exposure of your bladder, you 
should drink sufficient amounts and empty your bladder prior to and after the scintigraphic 
examination. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age because the safety and 
efficacy of the product have not been established. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Scintimun 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, since they may interfere with the 
interpretation of the images. 
Medicines reducing inflammation and medicines affecting the production of your blood cells (such as 
corticosteroids or antibiotics) may affect the results of your examination. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.  </p>
<p>You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of Scintimun if there is a 
possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. When 
in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant you must not be given Scintimun. 
Investigations in nuclear medicine may involve a risk to the unborn. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding you must stop breast-feeding for 3 days after your injection and the expressed 
milk should be discarded. If you wish, you can express and store your breast milk before your 
injection. This will protect your child from the radiation that may be present in your breast milk. 
Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. 
Moreover you must avoid close contact with your child during the first 12 hours after the injection. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Scintimun will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>
<p>Scintimun contains sorbitol and sodium 
This medicine contains 2 mg sorbitol in each vial of Scintimun. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you 
have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, you must not receive this medicine. 
Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.<br />
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you  have HFI. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium- free . </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Scintimun 
will only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by 
people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe 
use of this product and will keep you informed of their actions. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of 
technetium(99mTc)- besilesomab to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to 
get the desired information.<br />
The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 400 to 800 MBq 
(megabecquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity).  </p>
<p>Administration of Scintimun and conduct of the procedure 
Scintimun is administered intravenously. 
A single injection into a vein in your arm is sufficient to conduct the test your doctor needs. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
Your Nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure.  </p>
<p>After administration of Scintimun 
Because you could emit radiation especially harmful to young children during the first 12 hours after 
the injection, you should avoid close contact with young children and pregnant women during this 
period of time. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more Scintimun than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because injection is prepared as a single dose by the hospital personnel, under 
strictly controlled conditions. However, in the case of an overdose, you will be asked to drink plenty 
of water and to take laxatives to increase the elimination of the product from your body. </p>
<p>Should you have any further questions on the use of Scintimun, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>This radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk 
of cancer and hereditary abnormalities. </p>
<p>About 14 out of 100 patients having this injection have been found to produce antibodies in their 
blood reacting against the antibody present in Scintimun. This may increase the risk of allergic 
reactions in case of repeated administration of Scintimun. Therefore you should not receive Scintimun 
a second time. 
In case of allergic reaction you will receive appropriate treatment from your doctor. </p>
<p>Possible side effects are listed in the order of their frequency below: </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
Development of human anti-mouse antibodies reacting against the antibody in Scintimun 
(antibody of the mouse cells) with a risk of allergic reaction </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
Low blood pressure </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
Allergic reaction, including swelling of the face, hives (urticaria) </p>
<p>Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
* Serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty in breathing or dizziness 
* Muscle or joint pain </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or the specialist in nuclear medicine. This includes any 
possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national 
reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more 
information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
