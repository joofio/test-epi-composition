<ul>
<li>Salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators help the airways into the lungs to stay open. 
This makes it easier for air to get in and out. The effects of salmeterol last for at least 12 hours. </li>
<li>Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid which reduces swelling and irritation in the lungs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Seffalair Spiromax is used to treat asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. </p>
<p>Seffalair Spiromax helps to prevent breathlessness and wheeziness coming on. You should not use it to 
relieve an asthma attack. If you have an asthma attack, use a fast-acting reliever (rescue) inhaler, such 
as salbutamol. You should always have your fast-acting rescue inhaler with you. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Seffalair Spiromax if you have: 
* Heart disease, including an irregular or fast heart beat 
* Overactive thyroid gland 
* High blood pressure 
* Diabetes (Seffalair Spiromax may increase your blood sugar) 
* Low potassium in your blood<br />
* Tuberculosis (TB) now or have had in the past, or have other lung infections </p>
<p>Contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents under the age of 12 years because it has not been studied 
in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Seffalair Spiromax 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking or, have recently taken or might use any other 
medicines. Seffalair Spiromax may not be suitable for use with some other medicines.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines, before starting to use Seffalair Spiromax: 
* Beta blockers (such as atenolol, propranolol and sotalol). Beta blockers are mostly used for high blood 
pressure or heart conditions such as angina. 
* Medicines to treat infections (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole and erythromycin). Some of 
these medicines may increase the amount of salmeterol or fluticasone propionate in your body. This can 
increase side effects with Seffalair Spiromax, including irregular heartbeats, or may make side effects 
worse. 
* Corticosteroids (by mouth or by injection). Recent use of these medicines might increase the risk of 
Seffalair Spiromax affecting your adrenal glands by reducing the amount of steroid hormones produced 
by the glands (adrenal suppression). 
* Diuretics, medicines that increase urine production and are used to treat high blood pressure.<br />
<em> Other bronchodilators (such as salbutamol).<br />
</em> Xanthine medicines such as aminophylline and theophylline. These are often used to treat asthma. </p>
<p>Some medicines may increase the effects of Seffalair Spiromax and your doctor may wish to monitor you 
carefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>It is not known if this medicine can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, check with your doctor, 
nurse or pharmacist before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Seffalair Spiromax is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Seffalair Spiromax contains lactose 
Each dose of this medicine contains approximately 5.4 milligrams of lactose. If you have been told by your 
doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is one inhalation twice a day. 
* Seffalair Spiromax is for long-term regular use. Use it every day to keep your asthma under control. Do 
not use more than the recommended dose. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not 
sure. 
* Do not stop taking Seffalair Spiromax or reduce the dose without talking to your doctor or nurse first. 
* Seffalair Spiromax should be inhaled through the mouth. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will help you to manage your asthma. The doctor or nurse will change your inhaler 
medicine if you need a different dose to control your asthma properly. However, do not change the number 
of inhalations your doctor or nurse has prescribed without talking to your doctor or nurse first. </p>
<p>If your asthma or breathing gets worse tell your doctor straight away. If you feel more wheezy, your 
chest feels tight more often, or you need to use more of your fast-acting ‘reliever’ medicine, your asthma 
may be getting worse and you could become seriously ill. Continue to use Seffalair Spiromax but do not 
increase the number of inhalations you take. See your doctor at once as you may need additional treatment. </p>
<p>Instructions for use </p>
<p>Training 
Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist should train you on how to use your inhaler, including how to 
inhale a dose effectively. This training is important to ensure you receive the dose you require. If you 
have not received this training please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to show you how to use 
your inhaler properly before you use it for the first time.   </p>
<p>Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist should also check from time to time that you are using the Spiromax 
device properly and as prescribed. If you are not using Seffalair Spiromax properly or you are not breathing 
it in forcefully enough, you may not be getting enough medicine into your lungs. This means that the 
medicine will not help your asthma as well as it should. </p>
<p>Preparing your Seffalair Spiromax  </p>
<p>Before using your Seffalair Spiromax for the first time, you need to prepare it for use as follows: 
• Check the dose indicator to see that there are 60 inhalations in the inhaler. 
• Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label on the inhaler. 
• You do not need to shake your inhaler before you use it. </p>
