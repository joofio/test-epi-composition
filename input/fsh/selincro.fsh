  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Selincro contains the active substance nalmefene. </p>
<p>Selincro is used for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence 
who still have a high level of alcohol consumption 2 weeks after the first consultation with their 
doctor.  </p>
<p>Alcohol dependence occurs when a person has a physical or psychological dependence on the 
consumption of alcohol. </p>
<p>A high level of alcohol consumption is defined as drinking more than 60 g of pure alcohol per day for 
men and more than 40 g of pure alcohol per day for women. For example, a bottle of wine (750 ml; 
12% alcohol by volume) contains approximately 70 g alcohol and a bottle of beer (330 ml; 5% alcohol 
by volume) contains approximately 13 g alcohol. </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed Selincro because you were not able to reduce your alcohol consumption on 
your own. Your doctor will provide you with counselling to help you keep to your treatment and<br />
thereby reduce your alcohol consumption. </p>
<p>Selincro works by affecting processes in the brain that are responsible for your urge to continue 
drinking. </p>
<p>A high level of alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of health and social problems. 
Selincro can help you reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, and keep the reduced level of alcohol 
consumption. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to nalmefene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) </li>
<li>if you are taking medicines containing opioids, for example, methadone or buprenorphine or 
pain killers (such as morphine, oxycodone or other opioids) </li>
<li>if you are or have recently been dependent on opioids. You may experience acute opioid 
withdrawal symptoms (such as feeling sick, vomiting, shakiness, sweating and anxiety) </li>
<li>if you experience, or suspect you are experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms  </li>
<li>if your liver or kidney function is poor </li>
<li>if you are experiencing or have recently experienced several alcohol withdrawal symptoms 
(such as seeing, hearing or sensing things that are not there, seizures and shakiness)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Selincro. Inform your doctor about any other diseases 
you may have, for example, depression, seizure, liver or kidney disease. </p>
<p>If you and your doctor have decided that your immediate goal is abstinence (not drinking any alcohol), 
you should not take Selincro because Selincro is indicated for reduction of alcohol consumption. </p>
<p>If you require emergency medical attention, tell your doctor that you are taking Selincro. Your use of 
Selincro may affect your doctor’s choice of emergency treatment. </p>
<p>If you are going to have a surgical procedure, talk to your doctor at least 1 week before the procedure. 
You may need to stop taking Selincro temporarily. </p>
<p>If you feel detached from yourself, see or hear things that are not there, and this continues to recur for 
more than a few days, stop taking Selincro and talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>The increased suicidal risk in alcohol and substances abusers, with or without accompanying 
depression, is not reduced by the intake of nalmefene. </p>
<p>If you are 65 years old or above, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Selincro. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Selincro should not be used in children or adolescents below the age of 18 years because Selincro has 
not been tested in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Selincro </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Caution should be excercised when taking medicines such as diclofenac (antiinflammatory 
medicine used to treat, for example, muscle pain), fluconazole (antibiotic used to treat diseases caused 
by some types of fungus), omeprazole (medicine used to block the production of acid in the stomach), 
or rifampicin (antibiotic used to treat diseases caused by some types of bacteria) together with 
Selincro. </p>
<p>If you take medicines containing opioids, the effects of these medicines will be reduced, or the 
medicines may not work at all if you take them together with Selincro. These medicines include 
certain types of cough and cold medicines, certain medicines for diarrhoea and strong pain killers. </p>
<p>Selincro with food and alcohol </p>
<p>Selincro does not prevent the intoxicating effects of alcohol. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not known if Selincro is safe to use during pregnancy and breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Selincro is not recommended if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, you and your doctor should make a decision whether to discontinue breast-
feeding or to discontinue Selincro therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the 
child and the benefit of therapy to you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Side effects such as disturbance in attention, visual impairment, feeling abnormal, nausea, dizziness, 
somnolence, insomnia, and headache may occur when beginning Selincro treatment. The majority of 
these reactions were mild or moderate, occurred at the beginning of treatment and lasted for a few 
hours to a few days. These side effects may affect your skills when driving or doing anything that 
requires you to be alert, including operating machinery. </p>
<p>Selincro contains lactose </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
