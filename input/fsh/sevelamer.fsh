  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop contains the active substance sevelamer carbonate. It binds phosphate from 
food in the digestive tract and so reduces serum phosphorus levels in the blood. </p>
<p>This medicine is used to control hyperphosphataemia (high blood phosphate levels) in: 
* adult patients on dialysis (a blood clearance technique). It can be used in patients undergoing 
haemodialysis (using a blood filtration machine) or peritoneal dialysis (where fluid is pumped into the 
abdomen and an internal body membrane filters the blood); 
* patients with chronic (long-term) kidney disease who are not on dialysis and have a serum (blood) 
phosphorus level equal to or above 1.78 mmol/L.  </p>
<p>This medicine should be used with other treatments such as calcium supplements and vitamin D to prevent 
the development of bone disease. </p>
<p>Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to hard deposits in your body called calcification. These 
deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and make it harder for blood to be pumped around the body. 
Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to sevelamer carbonate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
* if you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you). 
* if you have bowel obstruction.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop: 
* if you have swallowing problems. Your doctor can rather prescribe sevelamer carbonate powder for 
oral suspension. 
* if you have problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel 
* if you have active inflammation of the bowel 
* if you have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor while taking Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop: 
* if you experience severe abdominal pain, stomach or intestine disorders, or blood in the stool 
(gastrointestinal bleeding). These symptoms can be due to serious inflammatory bowel disease caused 
by sevelamer crystal deposit in your bowel. Contact your doctor who will decide on continuing the 
treatment or not. </p>
<p>Additional treatments: 
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: 
* develop low or high levels of calcium in your blood. Since this medicine does not contain calcium 
your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. 
* have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels of 
vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take 
multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your 
blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental vitamins as 
necessary. 
* have disturbed level of bicarbonate in your blood and increased acidity in the blood and other body 
tissue. Your doctor should monitor the level of bicarbonate in your blood. </p>
<p>Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis: 
You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis. 
This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You should tell your 
doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, 
abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 6 years because the safety and efficacy in children 
(below the age of 6 years) have not been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor 
when taking Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (medicines used 
to suppress the immune system) may be reduced by Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop. Your doctor will 
advise you if you are taking these medicines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thyroid hormone deficiency may uncommonly be observed in certain people taking levothyroxine 
(used to treat low thyroid hormone levels) and Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop. Therefore your doctor 
may monitor the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood more closely.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines treating heartburn and reflux from your stomach or oesophagus, such as omeprazole, 
pantoprazole, or lansoprazole, known as “proton pump inhibitors”, may reduce the efficacy of 
Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop.  Your doctor may monitor the phosphate level in your blood. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will check for interactions between Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop and other medicines on a 
regular basis. </p>
<p>In some cases where Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop should be taken at the same time as another medicine, 
your doctor may advise you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Sevelamer carbonate 
Winthrop intake. Your doctor may also consider monitoring the levels of that medicine in your blood. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before taking this medicine.<br />
The potential risk of Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop during human pregnancy is unknown. Talk to your 
doctor who will decide if you can continue the treatment with Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop. </p>
<p>It is unknown whether Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop is excreted in breast milk and may affect your baby. 
Talk to your doctor who will decide if you can breastfeed your baby or not, and if it is necessary to stop 
Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines.  </p>
<p>Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you take more Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop than you should

<p>If you stop taking Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop 
Taking your Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop treatment is important to maintain an appropriate phosphate level 
in your blood. Stopping Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop would lead to important consequences such as 
calcification in the blood vessels. If you consider stopping your Sevelamer carbonate Winthrop treatment, 
contact your doctor or pharmacist first.
