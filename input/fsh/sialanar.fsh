Glycopyrronium belongs to a group of medicines known as quaternary ammonium anticholinergics, 
which are agents that block or reduce the transmission between nerve cells. This reduced transmission 
can de-activate the cells that produce saliva. </p>
<p>Sialanar is used to treat excessive production of saliva (sialorrhoea) in children and adolescents aged 
3 years and older.  </p>
<p>Sialorrhoea (drooling or excessive salivation) is a common symptom of many diseases of the nerves 
and muscles. It is mostly caused by poor control of muscles in the face. Acute sialorrhoea may be 
associated with inflammation, dental infections or infections of the mouth. </p>
<p>Sialanar acts on the salivary glands to reduce production of saliva.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Sialanar if your child has: 
* heart disease, heart failure, irregular heartbeats or high blood pressure <br />
* digestive disorders (constipation; chronic heartburn and indigestion) 
* a high temperature (fever) 
* inability to sweat normally 
* kidney problems or difficulty passing urine 
* abnormal blood brain barrier (the layer of cells surrounding the brain) </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to your child, talk to a doctor or pharmacist before

<p>The carer should stop treatment and seek advice from the prescriber in the event of: 
* pneumonia 
* allergic reaction 
* urinary retention<br />
* changes in behaviour 
* constipation 
* fever 
Avoid exposing the child to hot or very warm temperature (hot weather, high room temperature) to 
avoid over heating and the possibility of heat stroke. Check with the child s doctor during hot weather 
to see if the dose of Sialanar should be reduced. </p>
<p>Reduced salivation can increase the risk of dental disease therefore the child s teeth should be brushed 
daily and they should have regular dental health checks. </p>
<p>Children with kidney problems may be given a lower dose. </p>
<p>Check the child s pulse if they seem unwell. Report a very slow or very fast heart rate to their doctor. </p>
<p>Long-term use 
The long-term efficacy and safety of Sialanar has not been studied beyond 24 weeks of use. Continued 
use of Sialanar should be discussed with the child s doctor every 3 months to check that Sialanar is 
still right for the child.  </p>
<p>Children under 3 years 
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age because it is formulated as an oral 
formulation and a dose specifically for use in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sialanar 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular taking Sialanar with the following medicines can affect the way Sialanar or the listed 
medicine works or can increase the risk of side effects: 
* potassium chloride solid oral dose (see section above  Do not give Sialanar if the child or 
adolescent: )<br />
<em> anticholinergic medicines (see section above  Do not give Sialanar if the child or adolescent: ) 
* antispasmodics used to treat sickness or vomiting e.g. domperidone and metaclopramide 
* topiramate used to treat epilepsy 
* antihistamines, used to treat some allergies 
* neuroleptics/antipsychotics (clozapine, haloperidol, phenothiazine), used to treat some mental 
illnesses 
* skeletal muscle relaxants (botulinum toxin) 
* antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants)<br />
</em> opioids used to treat severe pain 
* corticosteroids, used to treat inflammatory diseases  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for further information about medicines to avoid whilst taking 
Sialanar. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine is intended for use in children and adolescents. Sialanar must not be given if the patient 
is pregnant (or could be pregnant), or is breast-feeding (see section 2  Do not give ). Discuss with the 
child s doctor whether there is a need for contraception. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Sialanar may affect vision and co-ordination. This may affect performance at skilled tasks such as 
driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines. After receiving Sialanar, the patient should not drive a 
vehicle, ride a bicycle or use a machine until the effect in their vision and co-ordination has 
completely recovered. Ask your doctor if you need further advice. </p>
<p>Sialanar contains sodium and benzoate salt (E211) 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium free . This medicine contains 2.3 mg benzoate salt (E211) in each ml. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Children and adolescents 3 years to less than 18 years: 
Your doctor will decide the correct dose of Sialanar. The initial dose will be calculated based on the 
weight of the child.  Dose increases will be decided by the child s doctor, using the table below as a 
guide, and will depend on both the effect of Sialanar and any side effects the patient is experiencing 
(this is why several dose levels appear in the table below). Section 4 includes possible side effects 
related to the use of Sialanar. These should be discussed with the child s doctor at all medical 
consultations, including those for dose increases and decreases, and at any other time should you be 
concerned.  </p>

<p>Give the dose prescribed by your doctor to the child three times each day.

<p>Instructions for use </p>

the pharmacist). 
Insert the end of the oral syringe into the syringe adaptor and ensure it is secure. </p>
<p>Hold the oral syringe in place and turn the bottle upside down. Gently pull down the plunger to the 
correct level (see the tables for the correct dose). Check you have the correct level. The maximum 
volume of the highest dose is 6 ml. </p>
<p>Turn the bottle upright.

<p>Place the oral syringe inside the child s mouth and press the plunger slowly to gently release the 
medicine. </p>
<p>After use, leave the syringe adaptor in the neck of the bottle. 
Replace the closure. 
The oral syringe should be gently washed with warm water and allowed to dry after each use (i.e. three 
times per day). Do not use a dishwasher. </p>
<p>If your child is given the medicine through a feeding tube, flush the tube with 10 ml of water after you 
have given the medicine. </p>
<p>If you give more Sialanar than you should 
It is important to make sure an acurate dose is given each time in order to prevent harmful effects of 
Sialanar seen with dosing errors or overdose.   </p>
<p>Check that you have drawn up the correct level on the syringe before giving Sialanar. </p>
<p>Seek medical advice immediately if the child is given too much Sialanar, even if the child seems well.  </p>
<p>If you forget to give Sialanar 
Give the next dose when it is due. Do not give a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose.  </p>
<p>If you stop giving Sialanar to your child 
Withdrawal effects are not expected when stopping Sialanar. The child s doctor may decide to stop 
treatment with Sialanar if side effects cannot be managed by reducing the dose.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
