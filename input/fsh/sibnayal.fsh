<ul>
<li>you are allergic to potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6), </li>
<li>you have a severe kidney disease or kidney failure, </li>
<li>you have a high level of potassium in your blood (hyperkalaemia). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Sibnayal if: 
- you have a disease or you take a medicine that can increase your blood potassium (see below “Other 
medicines and Sibnayal”), 
- you frequently have gastro-intestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, 
- you have chronic kidney disease. </p>
<p>Sibnayal prolonged-release granules are designed to release the active substances slowly after taking the 
granules. You may see remains of the granules in your stools. This is normal and does not reduce the 
effectiveness of the medicine. </p>
<p>If you vomit within two hours after intake, you should take another dose. </p>
<p>You will need regular appointments with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do 
blood, urine or heart tests, to adjust the dose of Sibnayal. Your doctor will regularly check your kidney 
function if you are elderly and/or have worsening kidney function.  </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age because of the risk of choking.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sibnayal </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may affect how Sibnayal works or make side effects more likely. These include:<br />
- any medicine that increases the level of potassium in your blood such as: 
- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure, heart 
disease and kidney disease in patients suffering from type 1 diabetes), 
- potassium-sparing diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure, fluid build-up in tissue 
(oedema) and heart conditions), 
- potassium supplements (used to prevent or treat low potassium levels in the blood), 
- ciclosporin (used to prevent or treat transplant rejection), 
- heparin sodium (used to prevent or delay blood clotting), 
- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (used to reduce fever, pain and 
inflammation), 
- any medicine that may be affected by a disturbance in the level of potassium in your blood such 
as: 
- digitalis glycosides (such as digoxin, used to treat heart failure and certain heart rhythm 
disorders), 
- corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation), 
- any other medicine that could cause heart rhythm disorders such as: 
- amiodarone and quinidine (used to control cardiac rhythm), 
- chlorpromazine (used to treat certain mental illnesses), 
- cisapride (used to treat heartburn), 
- sparfloxacin (used to treat certain bacterial infections). </p>
<p>Some medicines may be affected by increased urine pH in relation with Sibnayal treatment such as : 
- salicylates (used to treat pain and inflammation – aspirin-like medicines), 
- tetracyclines (used to treat certain bacterial infections), 
- barbiturates (sleep inducing medicines).  </p>
<p>Sibnayal with food, drink and alcohol </p>
<p>Do not mix Sibnayal with hot food or hot liquids. <br />
Do not drink alcohol while you are taking Sibnayal.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Sibnayal is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Sibnayal contains potassium </p>
<p>Sibnayal 8 mEq contains 308 mg of potassium per sachet. This is to be taken into consideration if you 
have a reduced kidney function or if you are on a controlled potassium diet. </p>
<p>Sibnayal 24 mEq contains 924 mg of potassium per sachet. This is to be taken into consideration if you 
have a reduced kidney function or if you are on a controlled potassium diet. </p>         </div>"""
