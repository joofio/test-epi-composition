receptors triggers nerve impulses in the brain that help to control body movements.
SIFROL is used to:
-
treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson s disease in adults. It can be used alone or in 
combination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson s disease).
-
treat the symptoms of moderate to severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome in adults.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking SIFROL. Tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop any medical 
conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following:
-
Kidney disease.
-
Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are visual.
-
Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced 
Parkinson s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up-
titration of SIFROL.
-
Dystonia (inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia)). In 
particular, you may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), 
forward bending of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back 
(also called pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome).
-
Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep.
-
Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia).
-
Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with SIFROL.
-
Severe heart or blood vessels disease. You will need to have your blood pressure checked 
regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall in 
blood pressure on standing up).
-
Restless legs augmentation syndrome. If you experience that symptoms start earlier than usual in 
the evening (or even the afternoon), are more intense or involve larger parts of the affected limbs 
or involve other limbs. Your doctor may lower your dose or stop the treatment.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to 
behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry 
out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and 
can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high 
sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to 
adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling 
elated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion or loss of reality). Your doctor 
may need to adjust or stop your dose.
Tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or 
pain after stopping or reducing your SIFROL treatment. If the problems persist more than a few 
weeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.
Tell your doctor if you are developing an inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright 
(axial dystonia). If this happens, your doctor may want to adjust or change your medication.
Children and adolescents
SIFROL is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years.
Other medicines and SIFROL
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have 
obtained without a prescription.
You should avoid taking SIFROL together with antipsychotic medicines.
Take care if you are taking the following medicines:
-
cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers)
-
amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson s disease)
-
mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia)
-
zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a 
disease of the human immune system)
-
cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers)
-
quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the 
treatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria))
-
procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat)
If you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start 
treatment with SIFROL.
Take care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are 
drinking alcohol. In these cases SIFROL may affect your ability to drive and operate machinery.
SIFROL with food, drink and alcohol
You should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with SIFROL.
SIFROL can be taken with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with you if you 
should continue to take SIFROL.
The effect of SIFROL on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take SIFROL if you are 
pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.
SIFROL should not be used during breast-feeding. SIFROL can reduce the production of breast milk. 
Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of SIFROL is unavoidable, 
breast-feeding should be stopped.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
SIFROL can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If affected, do 
not drive or use machines.
SIFROL has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly in 
patients with Parkinson s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate 
machinery. You should tell your doctor if this occurs.</p>         </div>"""

start again at the lowest dose. You can then build up the dose again, as you did the first time. Ask your 
doctor for advice.
Your doctor will review your treatment after 3 months to decide whether or not to continue the 
treatment.
Patients with kidney disease
If you have severe kidney disease, SIFROL may not be a suitable treatment for you.
If you take more SIFROL than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets,
-
Contact your doctor or nearest hospital casualty department immediately for advice.
-
You may experience vomiting, restlessness, or any of the side effects as described in section 4 
 Possible side effects .
If you forget to take SIFROL
Do not worry. Simply leave out that dose completely and then take your next dose at the right time. 
Do not try to make up for the missed dose.
If you stop taking SIFROL
Do not stop taking SIFROL without first talking to your doctor. If you have to stop taking this 
medicine, your doctor will reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of worsening symptoms.
If you suffer from Parkinson s disease you should not stop treatment with SIFROL abruptly. A sudden 
stop could cause you to develop a medical condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome which 
may represent a major health risk. The symptoms include:
-
akinesia (loss of muscle movement)
-
rigid muscles
-
fever
-
unstable blood pressure
-
tachycardia (increased heart rate)
-
confusion
-
depressed level of consciousness (e.g. coma)
If you stop or reduce SIFROL you may also develop a medical condition called dopamine agonist 
withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms include depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain. If 
you experience these symptoms you should contact your physician.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
