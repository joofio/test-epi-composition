  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Signifor is a medicine that contains the active substance pasireotide. It is used to treat Cushing’s 
disease in adult patients for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed. </p>
<p>Cushing’s disease is caused by an enlargement in the pituitary gland (a gland at the base of the brain) 
called a pituitary adenoma. This leads the body to over-produce a hormone called adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH), which in turn results in over-production of another hormone called cortisol. </p>
<p>The human body naturally produces a substance called somatostatin, which blocks the production of 
certain hormones, including ACTH. Pasireotide works in a very similar way to somatostatin. Signifor 
is thus able to block the production of ACTH, helping to control the over-production of cortisol and 
improve the symptoms of Cushing’s disease. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Signifor works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to pasireotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have severe liver problems. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Signifor if you currently have or have ever had: 
- problems with your blood sugar levels, whether too high (as in hyperglycaemia/diabetes) or too 
low (hypoglycaemia); 
- heart problems such as a recent heart attack, congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease 
where the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body) or sudden and oppressive chest 
pain (usually felt as pressure, heaviness, tightening, squeezing or aching across the chest); 
- a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or an abnormal electrical signal called 
“prolongation of the QT interval”, or “QT prolongation”; 
- low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood; 
- gallstones. </p>
<p>During your treatment with Signifor 
- Signifor controls over-production of cortisol. The control may be too strong and you may 
experience signs or symptoms associated with a lack of cortisol, such as extreme weakness, 
tiredness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting or low blood pressure. If this happens, tell your doctor 
immediately. 
- Signifor may cause your blood sugar to increase. Your doctor may want to monitor your blood 
sugar and start treatment with or adjust your antidiabetic medicine. 
- Signifor may lower your heart rate. Your doctor may wish to monitor your heart rate using a 
machine that measures electrical activity of the heart (an “ECG”, or electrocardiogram). If you 
are using medicine to treat a heart condition, your doctor may also need to adjust its dosage. 
- your doctor may also wish to check your gallbladder, liver enzymes and pituitary hormones 
periodically, since these might all be affected by this medicine. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old because no data are available 
in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Signifor 
Signifor may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are using other medicines at the same 
time as Signifor (including medicines obtained without a prescription), your doctor may need to 
monitor your heart more carefully or change the dose of Signifor or the other medicines. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Especially, 
tell your doctor if you are using: 
- medicines to treat irregular heartbeat, such as medicines containing disopyramide, 
procainamide, quinidine, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide, amiodarone or dronedarone; 
- medicines to treat bacterial infections (by mouth: clarithromycin, moxifloxacin; via injection: 
erythromycin, pentamidine); 
- medicines to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole, except in shampoo); 
- medicines to treat certain psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, 
pimozide, haloperidol, tiapride, amisulpride, sertindole, methadone); 
- medicines to treat hay fever and other allergies (terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine); 
- medicines used in the prevention or treatment of malaria (chloroquine, halofantrine, 
lumefantrine); 
- medicines to control blood pressure such as: 
* beta blockers (metoprolol, carteolol, propranolol, sotalol) 
* calcium channel blockers (bepridil, verapamil, diltiazem) 
* cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, physostigmine); 
- medicines to control the balance of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium) in your body. </p>
<p>It is particularly important that you mention any of the following medicines: 
- ciclosporin (used in organ transplantation to reduce the activity of the immune system); 
- medicines to treat blood sugar levels that are too high (as in diabetes) or too low 
(hypoglycaemia), such as: 
* insulin; 
* metformin, liraglutide, vildagliptin, nateglinide (antidiabetic medicines). </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using any medicine. 
- You should not use Signifor during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or 
think that you may be, it is important to tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you 
can use Signifor during your pregnancy. 
- You should not breast-feed while using Signifor. It is not known whether Signifor passes into 
breast milk. 
- If you are a sexually active woman, you should use an effective method of contraception during 
treatment. Ask your doctor about the need for contraception before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Signifor may have a minor effect on the ability to drive and use machines, because some of the side 
effects you may experience while using Signifor, such as dizziness, headache and tiredness, may 
reduce your ability to drive and use machines safely. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Signifor 
Signifor contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, which means it is essentially 
“sodium-free”. </p>         </div>"""

the instructions at the end of this leaflet. If you have any questions, contact your doctor, nurse or

<p>Signifor is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short needle into the 
fatty tissue just under the skin. The thighs and the abdomen are good areas for subcutaneous injection. 
Avoid soreness and skin irritation by choosing a different site from the previous one for each injection. 
You should also avoid injections at sites that are sore or where the skin is irritated. </p>
<p>Do not use Signifor if you notice the solution is not clear or contains particles. The solution should be 
free of visible particles, clear and colourless. </p>

nurse or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Signifor 
Do not inject a double dose of Signifor to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forgot to inject a dose 
of Signifor, simply inject the next dose at the scheduled time. </p>
<p>If you stop using Signifor 
If you interrupt your treatment with Signifor your cortisol level may increase again and your 
symptoms may come back. Therefore, do not stop using Signifor unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
