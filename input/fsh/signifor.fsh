  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Signifor is a medicine that contains the active substance pasireotide. It is used to treat Cushing s 
disease in adult patients for whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed. </p>
<p>Cushing s disease is caused by an enlargement in the pituitary gland (a gland at the base of the brain) 
called a pituitary adenoma. This leads the body to over-produce a hormone called adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH), which in turn results in over-production of another hormone called cortisol. </p>
<p>The human body naturally produces a substance called somatostatin, which blocks the production of 
certain hormones, including ACTH. Pasireotide works in a very similar way to somatostatin. Signifor 
is thus able to block the production of ACTH, helping to control the over-production of cortisol and 
improve the symptoms of Cushing s disease. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Signifor works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to pasireotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have severe liver problems. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Signifor if you currently have or have ever had:</p>
<ul>
<li>problems with your blood sugar levels, whether too high (as in hyperglycaemia/diabetes) or too 
low (hypoglycaemia); </li>
<li>heart problems such as a recent heart attack, congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease 
where the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body) or sudden and oppressive chest 
pain (usually felt as pressure, heaviness, tightening, squeezing or aching across the chest); </li>
<li>a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or an abnormal electrical signal called 
 prolongation of the QT interval , or  QT prolongation ; </li>
<li>low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood; </li>
<li>gallstones. </li>
</ul>
<p>During your treatment with Signifor 
- Signifor controls over-production of cortisol. The control may be too strong and you may 
experience signs or symptoms associated with a lack of cortisol, such as extreme weakness, 
tiredness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting or low blood pressure. If this happens, tell your doctor 
immediately. 
- Signifor may cause your blood sugar to increase. Your doctor may want to monitor your blood 
sugar and start treatment with or adjust your antidiabetic medicine. 
- Signifor may lower your heart rate. Your doctor may wish to monitor your heart rate using a 
machine that measures electrical activity of the heart (an  ECG , or electrocardiogram). If you 
are using medicine to treat a heart condition, your doctor may also need to adjust its dosage. 
- your doctor may also wish to check your gallbladder, liver enzymes and pituitary hormones 
periodically, since these might all be affected by this medicine. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old because no data are available 
in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Signifor 
Signifor may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are using other medicines at the same 
time as Signifor (including medicines obtained without a prescription), your doctor may need to 
monitor your heart more carefully or change the dose of Signifor or the other medicines. Tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Especially, 
tell your doctor if you are using:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines to treat irregular heartbeat, such as medicines containing disopyramide, 
procainamide, quinidine, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide, amiodarone or dronedarone; </li>
<li>medicines to treat bacterial infections (by mouth: clarithromycin, moxifloxacin; via injection: 
erythromycin, pentamidine); </li>
<li>medicines to treat fungal infections (ketoconazole, except in shampoo); </li>
<li>medicines to treat certain psychiatric disorders (chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, 
pimozide, haloperidol, tiapride, amisulpride, sertindole, methadone); </li>
<li>medicines to treat hay fever and other allergies (terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine); </li>
<li>medicines used in the prevention or treatment of malaria (chloroquine, halofantrine, 
lumefantrine); </li>
<li>medicines to control blood pressure such as: </li>
<li>beta blockers (metoprolol, carteolol, propranolol, sotalol) </li>
<li>calcium channel blockers (bepridil, verapamil, diltiazem) </li>
<li>cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, physostigmine); </li>
<li>medicines to control the balance of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium) in your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is particularly important that you mention any of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>ciclosporin (used in organ transplantation to reduce the activity of the immune system); </li>
<li>medicines to treat blood sugar levels that are too high (as in diabetes) or too low 
(hypoglycaemia), such as: </li>
<li>insulin; </li>
<li>metformin, liraglutide, vildagliptin, nateglinide (antidiabetic medicines). </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using any medicine. 
- You should not use Signifor during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or 
think that you may be, it is important to tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you 
can use Signifor during your pregnancy. 
- You should not breast-feed while using Signifor. It is not known whether Signifor passes into 
breast milk. 
- If you are a sexually active woman, you should use an effective method of contraception during 
treatment. Ask your doctor about the need for contraception before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Signifor may have a minor effect on the ability to drive and use machines, because some of the side 
effects you may experience while using Signifor, such as dizziness, headache and tiredness, may 
reduce your ability to drive and use machines safely. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Signifor 
Signifor contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, which means it is essentially

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF SIGNIFOR SOLUTION FOR INJECTION </p>
<p>This medicine comes in an ampoule, i.e. a small glass container. Signifor should be administered using 
sterile disposable syringes and injection needles. </p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will have instructed you on how to use Signifor ampoules. However, before 
using the ampoule, please read the following information carefully. If you are not sure about giving 
yourself the injection or if you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. </p>
<p>The injection can be prepared using either two different needles to draw up and inject the solution or 
one short fine injection needle for both steps. Based on the local clinical practice, your doctor or nurse 
will tell you which method to use. Please follow their instructions. </p>
<p>Store Signifor ampoules according to the storage conditions listed on the box. </p>
<p>Important safety information 
Caution: Keep the ampoules out of the reach of children. </p>
<p>What do I need 
To give yourself an injection you will need: 
1. One Signifor ampoule 
2. Alcohol wipes or similar 
3. One sterile syringe 
4. One long thick blunt sterile needle for drawing up the solution (your doctor or nurse will tell 
you if this is needed) 
5. One short fine sterile needle 
6. A sharps container or other rigid closed disposal container </p>
<p>The injection site 
The injection site is the place on your body where you are going to give yourself the injection. 
Signifor is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short needle into the 
fatty tissue just under the skin. The thighs and the abdomen are good areas for subcutaneous injection. 
Avoid soreness and skin irritation by choosing a different site from the previous one for each injection. 
You should also avoid injections at sites that are sore or where the skin is irritated. </p>
<p>Getting started 
When you are ready to give yourself the injection, carefully follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. </li>
<li>Use new disposable needles and syringes every time you give yourself an injection. Use 
syringes and needles only once. Never share needles and syringes. </li>
<li>Take the ampoule out of the box. </li>
<li>Inspect the ampoule. DO NOT USE if it is broken or if the liquid looks cloudy or contains 
particles. In all these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. </li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce local discomfort, it is recommended that the solution is at room temperature before 
administration. </p>
<p>Ampoules should be opened just prior to administration, and any unused portion discarded. </p>
<p>Check the expiry date and the dose 
Check the expiry date which is stated on the ampoule label (after  EXP ) and check that the ampoule 
contains the dose that your doctor has prescribed. </p>
<p>DO NOT USE if the medicine has expired or if the dose is incorrect. In both these cases, return 
the entire pack to the pharmacy. </p>
<p>How to inject Signifor </p>
<p>Step 1: 
Signifor solution for injection is filled in a break-off 
ampoule. The coloured dot on the top part marks the 
position of the breaking point on the neck of the 
ampoule. Tap the ampoule with your finger in order to 
make sure there is no liquid in the top part when you 
open the ampoule. </p>
<p>Step 2: 
Recommended procedure: hold the ampoule in an 
upright position with the coloured dot facing away 
from you. Hold the base of the ampoule in one hand. 
Keeping your thumbs together above and below the 
neck, break off the top of the ampoule at the breaking 
point. Once the ampoule is open, put it upright on a 
clean, flat surface. </p>
<p>Step 3: 
Take the sterile syringe and attach the needle to it. If 
you have been told to use two needles, you should use 
the long thick blunt one for this step. </p>
<p>Before you proceed to step 4, clean the injection site 
with an alcohol wipe. </p>
<p>Step 4: 
Remove the cover from the needle. Put the needle into 
the ampoule and pull the plunger to draw up the entire 
contents of the ampoule into the syringe. 
If you have been told to use two needles, you should 
now replace the long needle with the short one. </p>
<p>Step 5: 
Hold the syringe in one hand between two fingers with 
your thumb at the bottom of the plunger. Tap the 
syringe with your fingers to get rid of air bubbles. 
Make sure there is no air bubble in the syringe by 
pressing the plunger until the first drop appears on the 
tip of the needle. 
Do not let the needle touch anything. You are now 
ready to inject. </p>
<p>Step 6: 
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and, holding 
the needle at an angle of approximately 45 degrees (as 
shown in the picture) insert it into the injection site. 
Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood 
vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood in the 
syringe, first remove the needle from the skin, then 
replace the short needle with a new one and insert it 
into a different injection site. </p>
<p>Step 7: 
Always keeping your skin pinched, slowly press the 
plunger down as far as it will go until all the solution 
is injected. Keep the plunger pressed down and hold 
the syringe in place for 5 seconds. </p>
<p>Step 8: 
Slowly release the skin fold and gently pull the needle 
out. Put the cover back on the needle. </p>
<p>Step 9: 
Dispose of the used syringe and needle immediately in 
a sharps container or other rigid closed disposal 
container. Any unused product or waste material 
should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. </p>
