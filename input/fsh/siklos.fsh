  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Siklos is used to prevent painful crises, including sudden chest pain, caused by sickle cell disease, in 
adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years.  </p>
<p>Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects the disc shaped red cells of the blood.<br />
Some cells become abnormal, rigid and take a crescent or sickle shape which leads to anemia. 
The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. This can cause acute pain crises 
and organ damage. </p>
<p>For severe painful crises, most patients require hospitalisation. Siklos will decrease the number of 
painful crises as well as the need for hospitalisation linked with the disease.  </p>
<p>The active substance of Siklos, hydroxycarbamide, is a substance which inhibits growth and 
proliferation of some cells, such as blood cells. These effects lead to a reduction of circulating red, 
white and coagulation blood cells (myelosuppressive effect). In sickle cell disease, hydroxycarbamide 
helps also to prevent red blood cells from taking abnormal shape. </p>         </div>"""

are not sure. </p>
<p>Dose </p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much of Siklos to take each day and will describe the dose in 
whole, half or quarter tablets. </p>
<p>The prescribed dose of Siklos must be taken once daily, preferably in the morning before breakfast.<br />
It can be taken with a glass of water or a very small amount of food. 
If you cannot swallow the tablets, you can disintegrate them in water immediately before use: 
  Place the required dose (preferably broken if Siklos 1 000 mg tablet is used) in a teaspoon and add 
some water. 
  As soon as the tablet is disintegrated, swallow the content of the teaspoon. You can add a drop of 
syrup or mix the content with food to mask a possible bitter taste. 
  Then drink a large glass of water or any other drink. </p>
<p>Handling </p>
<p>Siklos is a cytotoxic medicine that must be handled with care. 
Any person, in particular pregnant women, who are not taking Siklos should avoid direct contact with 
the parts when breaking a tablet. Wash your hands before and after contact with the tablets. 
In case the prescribed dose requires breaking the tablet in halves or quarters, this should be done out of 
the reach of food. Powder spilled from the broken tablet should be wiped up with a damp disposable 
towel which must be thrown out. For the storage of unused broken tablets, see section 5  How to store 
Siklos . </p>
<p>Treatment follow-up </p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how long to take Siklos. </p>
<p>When taking Siklos you will have regular blood tests and check your liver and kidney. 
Depending on the dose you take, these tests may be performed monthly or every two months.  </p>
<p>Depending on these results your doctor will adjust your dose of Siklos. </p>
<p>If you take more Siklos than you should </p>
<p>If you take more Siklos than you should or if a child has taken any, contact your doctor or the nearest 
hospital immediately as you may need urgent medical treatment. The most common symptoms of 
overdose with Siklos are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redness of the skin, </li>
<li>Soreness (touch is painful) and swelling of the palms of hands and soles of feet followed by the 
hands and feet becoming scaly, </li>
<li>Skin becoming strongly pigmented (locally changes of colour), </li>
<li>Soreness or swelling in the mouth. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you forget to take Siklos </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. Continue as normal when it is time to take 
the next dose as prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Siklos </p>
<p>Do not stop your treatment unless advised by your doctor. 
If you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
