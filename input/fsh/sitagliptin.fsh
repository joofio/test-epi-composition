metformin. 
* sitagliptin belongs to a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors) 
* metformin belongs to a class of medicines called biguanides. </p>
<p>They work together to control blood sugar levels in adult patients with a form of diabetes called 
 type 2 diabetes mellitus . This medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal 
and lowers the amount of sugar made by your body. </p>
<p>Along with diet and exercise, this medicine helps lower your blood sugar. This medicine can be used 
alone or with certain other medicines for diabetes (insulin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones). </p>
<p>What is type 2 diabetes? 
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that 
your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. 
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems 
like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to sitagliptin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </li>
<li>if you have severely reduced kidney function </li>
<li>if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with e.g. severe hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose), 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see  Risk of lactic acidosis<br />
below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called  ketone bodies<br />
accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include stomach 
pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity smell. </li>
<li>if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated </li>
<li>if you are going to have an X-ray where you will be injected with a dye. You will need to stop 
taking Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan at the time of the X-ray and for 2 or more 
days after as directed by your doctor, depending on how your kidneys are working </li>
<li>if you have recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems, such as  shock  or 
breathing difficulties </li>
<li>if you have liver problems </li>
<li>if you drink alcohol to excess (either every day or only from time to time) </li>
<li>if you are breast-feeding </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not take Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan if any of the above apply to you and talk with 
your doctor about other ways of managing your diabetes. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan (see section 4). </p>
<p>If you encounter blistering of the skin, it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. 
Your doctor may ask you to stop Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan. </p>
<p>Risk of lactic acidosis 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called 
lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic 
acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol 
intake, dehydration (see further information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in 
which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). 
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan for a short time if you have a condition 
that may be associated with dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, 
diarrhoea, fever, exposure to heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further 
instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan and contact a doctor or the nearest 
hospital immediately if you experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition 
may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>vomiting </li>
<li>stomach ache (abdominal pain) </li>
<li>muscle cramps </li>
<li>a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness </li>
<li>difficulty in breathing </li>
<li>reduced body temperature and heartbeat </li>
</ul>
<p>Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis) </li>
<li>if you have or have had gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a 
form of fat) in your blood. These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting 
pancreatitis (see section 4) </li>
<li>if you have type 1 diabetes. This is sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes </li>
<li>if you have or have had an allergic reaction to sitagliptin, metformin, or sitagliptin/metformin 
hydrochloride (see section 4) </li>
<li>if you are taking a sulphonylurea or insulin, diabetes medicines, together with 
sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride, as you may experience low blood sugar levels 
(hypoglycaemia). Your doctor may reduce the dose of your sulphonylurea or insulin </li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to have major surgery, you must stop taking Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 
during and for some time after the procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when 
to restart your treatment with Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan. </p>
<p>During treatment with Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan, your doctor will check your kidney 
function at least once a year or more frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney 
function. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not use this medicine.<br />
It is not effective in children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if 
this medicine is safe and effective when used in children younger than 10 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan 
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example, in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride 
Mylan before or at the time of the injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to 
restart your treatment with Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may 
need to adjust the dose of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan. It is especially important to 
mention the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>medicines (taken by mouth, inhalation, or injection) used to treat diseases that involve 
inflammation, like asthma and arthritis (corticosteroids) </li>
<li>medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) </li>
<li>medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as 
ibuprofen and celecoxib) </li>
<li>certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists) </li>
<li>specific medicines for the treatment of bronchial asthma ( -sympathomimetics) </li>
<li>iodinated contrast agents or alcohol-containing medicines </li>
<li>certain medicines used to treat stomach problems such as cimetidine </li>
<li>ranolazine, a medicine used to treat angina </li>
<li>dolutegravir, a medicine used to treat HIV infection </li>
<li>vandetanib, a medicine used to treat a specific type of thyroid cancer (medullary thyroid cancer) </li>
<li>digoxin (to treat irregular heartbeat and other heart problems). The level of digoxin in your 
blood may need to be checked if taking with Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan with alcohol 
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Mylan since this 
may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding

your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should not take this medicine 
during pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding. See section 2, Do not take Sitagliptin/Metformin 
hydrochloride Mylan. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines
