called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) that lowers blood sugar levels in adult 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. </p>
<p>This medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal and decreases the amount of 
sugar made by the body. </p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to help lower your blood sugar, which is too high because of 
your type 2 diabetes. This medicine can be used alone or in combination with certain other medicines 
(insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones) that lower blood sugar, which you may already be 
taking for your diabetes together with a food and exercise plan. </p>
<p>What is type 2 diabetes? 
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that 
your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. 
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems 
like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Cases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving 
sitagliptin (see section 4). </p>
<p>If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid.

<ul>
<li>a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis) </li>
<li>gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of fat) in your blood. 
These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis (see section 4). </li>
<li>type 1 diabetes </li>
<li>diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, 
nausea or vomiting) </li>
<li>any past or present kidney problems </li>
<li>an allergic reaction to sitagliptin (see section 4) </li>
</ul>
<p>This medicine is unlikely to cause low blood sugar because it does not work when your blood sugar is

sulphonylurea or insulin medicine. </p>

sitagliptin. </p>
