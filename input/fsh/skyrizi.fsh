Skyrizi is used to treat the following inflammatory diseases:</p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis</p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis
How Skyrizi works
This medicine works by stopping a protein in the body called  IL-23 , which causes inflammation.
Plaque psoriasis
Skyrizi is used to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Skyrizi reduces inflammation 
and can therefore help reduce symptoms of plaque psoriasis such as burning, itching, pain, redness, 
and scaling.
Psoriatic arthritis
Skyrizi is used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a disease that causes inflamed 
joints and psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis, you may first be given other medicines. If 
these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Skyrizi either alone or in combination 
with other medicines to treat your psoriatic arthritis. 
Skyrizi reduces inflammation and can therefore help to reduce pain, stiffness, and swelling in and 
around your joints, pain and stiffness in your spine, psoriatic skin rash, psoriatic nail damage, and it 
may slow down damage to the bone and cartilage in your joints. These effects can ease your normal 
daily activities, reduce tiredness, and improve your quality of life.</p>         </div>"""
