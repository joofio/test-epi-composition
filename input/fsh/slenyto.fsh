Slenyto is a medicine that contains the active ingredient, melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone produced 
naturally by the body. </p>
<p>What it is used for 
Slenyto is for use in children and adolescents (2 to 18 years old) with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) and/or Smith-Magenis syndrome, a neurogenetic disease (inherited condition affecting the 
nerves and brain). </p>
<p>Slenyto shortens the time it takes to fall asleep and lengthens the duration of sleep. 
It is for the treatment of insomnia (sleeplessness) when a healthy sleeping routine (such as a regular 
bedtime and soothing sleeping environment) has not worked well enough.  The medicine can help you 
or your child fall asleep and may help you or your child sleep for longer during the night. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Slenyto if you or your child:</p>
<ul>
<li>has liver or kidney problems. You should speak to your doctor before taking/giving Slenyto as 
its use is not recommended in such cases. </li>
<li>suffers from an autoimmune disease (where the body s own immune (defence) system attacks 
parts of the body). You should speak to your doctor before taking/giving Slenyto as its use is 
not recommended in such cases. </li>
<li>feels drowsy (see section below on  Driving and using machines ). </li>
</ul>
<p>Children under 2 years old<br />
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years as it has not been tested and its effects 
are unknown. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Slenyto </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.   </p>
<p>In particular, taking Slenyto with the following medicines can increase the risk of side effects, or it can 
affect the way that Slenyto or the other medicine works: </p>
<ul>
<li>fluvoxamine (used for the treatment of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder) </li>
<li>methoxypsoralens (used in the treatment of skin disorders e.g. psoriasis) </li>
<li>cimetidine (used in the treatment of stomach problems such as ulcers) </li>
<li>quinolones (for example ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) and rifampicin (used in the treatment 
of bacterial infections) </li>
<li>oestrogens (used in contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy)  </li>
<li>carbamazepine (used in the treatment of epilepsy) </li>
<li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as aspirin and ibuprofen (used for treating 
pain and inflammation). These medicines should be avoided, especially in the evening. </li>
<li>beta-blockers (used to control blood pressure). These medicines should be taken in the 
morning. </li>
<li>benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics such as zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone 
(used to induce sleep) </li>
<li>thioridazine (used for the treatment of schizophrenia) </li>
<li>imipramine (used for the treatment of depression) </li>
</ul>
<p>Smoking 
Smoking can increase the breakdown of melatonin by the liver, which may make this medicine less 
effective. Please tell your doctor if you or your child starts or stops smoking during treatment. </p>
<p>Slenyto with alcohol 
Do not drink alcohol before, during or after taking Slenyto, because alcohol weakens the effect of the 
medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist before using Slenyto if you or your daughter: 
* is pregnant or might be pregnant.  As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use 
of melatonin during pregnancy. 
* is breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed. It is possible that melatonin is passed into human 
breast milk, therefore your doctor will decide whether you or your daughter should breastfeed 
whilst taking melatonin. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Slenyto may cause drowsiness.  After taking this medicine, you or your child should not drive a 
vehicle, ride a bicycle, or use machinery until completely recovered. </p>
<p>If you or your child suffers from continued drowsiness, you should consult your doctor. </p>
<p>Slenyto contains lactose<br />
Slenyto contains lactose monohydrate.  If you or your child has been told by your doctor that you have 
an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.  </p>         </div>"""

you are not sure. </p>
<p>How much 
Slenyto is available in two strengths: 1 mg and 5 mg.  The recommended starting dose is 2 mg (two 
1-mg tablets) once daily. If there is no improvement in your/your child s symptoms, your doctor may 
increase the dose of Slenyto to find the most suitable dose for you/your child. The maximum daily 
dose that you/your child will receive is 10 mg (two 5-mg tablets). </p>
<p>When<br />
Slenyto should be taken in the evening, 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. The tablets should be taken 
after the evening meal, i.e. on a full stomach. </p>
<p>How to take Slenyto 
Slenyto is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole and NOT broken, crushed or 
chewed.  Crushing and chewing damages the special properties of the tablet and means that they will 
not work properly. </p>
<p>The whole tablets can be put into food like yoghurt, orange juice or ice-cream to help with 
swallowing. If the tablets are mixed with these foods, they should be given immediately and not left or 
stored, as this may affect the way the tablets work.  If the tablets are mixed with any other type of 
food, the tablets may not work properly. </p>
<p>How long 
You or your child should be monitored by your doctor at regular intervals (recommended every 
6 months) to check that Slenyto is still the right treatment for you/them.   </p>
<p>If you or your child takes more Slenyto than you/they should 
If you/your child has accidentally taken too much medicine, contact the doctor or pharmacist as soon 
as possible. </p>
<p>Taking more than the recommended daily dose may make you/your child feel drowsy. </p>
<p>If you or your child forgets to take Slenyto 
If you or your child forgets to take a tablet, it could be taken before going to sleep that night, but after 
this time, no other tablet should be taken before the next evening. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you or your child stops taking Slenyto 
You should talk to your doctor before you/your child stops taking Slenyto. It is important to continue 
taking this medicine to treat the condition. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
