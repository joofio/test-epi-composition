edotreotide. Before it can be used, the powder in the vial is mixed with a radioactive substance called 
gallium (68Ga) chloride to make gallium (68Ga) edotreotide (this procedure is called radiolabelling). </p>
<p>Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide contains a small amount of radioactivity. After injection into a vein, it can 
make parts of the body visible to doctors during a medical imaging procedure called positron emission 
tomography (PET). This medical procedure obtains images of your organs to help locate abnormal 
cells or tumours, giving valuable information about your disease. </p>
<p>The use of SomaKit TOC involves exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit from the procedure with the 
radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to edotreotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given SomaKit TOC: 
- if you experienced any signs of allergic reaction (listed in section 4) after previous 
administration of SomaKit TOC; 
- if you have kidney or liver problems (renal or hepatic disease); 
- if you are under 18 years of age; 
- if you have signs of dehydration before and after the examination; 
- if you have other medical conditions, such as high level of cortisol in the body (Cushing 
syndrome), inflammation, thyroid disease, other type of tumour (of pituitary gland, lung, brain, 
breast, immune system, thyroid, adrenal gland or others) or disease of the spleen (including 
previous trauma or surgery involving the spleen). Such conditions may be visible and affect the 
interpretation of the images. Your doctor may therefore perform additional scans and tests to 
confirm the findings on gallium (68Ga) edotreotide imaging. 
- if you have been recently vaccinated. Enlarged lymph nodes due to vaccination may become 
visible during gallium (68Ga) edotreotide imaging; 
- if you have been taking other medicines, such as somatostatin analogues and glucocorticoids, 
which may interact with SomaKit TOC; 
- if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant; 
- if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precaution before 
or after using SomaKit TOC. </p>
<p>Before administration of SomaKit TOC 
You should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination in order to urinate as often as 
possible during the first hours after the procedure to ensure that SomaKit TOC is removed as quickly 
as possible from your body. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended in patients under 18 years of age because its safety and efficacy 
have not been established in this patient population. </p>
<p>Other medicines and SomaKit TOC 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including somatostatin analogues or glucocorticoids (also called corticosteroids), since they 
may interfere with the interpretation of the images. If you are taking somatostatin analogues you might 
be asked to stop your treatment for a short period of time. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of SomaKit TOC if there is a 
possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. 
When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the 
procedure. </p>
<p>There is no information about the safety and the efficacy of the use of this medicine during pregnancy. 
Only essential investigations should be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit far 
exceeds any risk to the mother and foetus. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding the nuclear medicine doctor may either delay the medical procedure until you 
are no longer breast-feeding or ask you to stop breast-feeding and to discard your milk until there is no 
radioactivity in your body (12 hours after the administration of SomaKit TOC). 
Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that SomaKit TOC will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>
<p>SomaKit TOC contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. </p>         </div>"""

will only be used in special controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given to you by 
people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe 
use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of SomaKit TOC to 
be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. 
The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 100 MBq to 200 MBq 
(megabecquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity). </p>
<p>Administration of SomaKit TOC and conduct of the procedure 
After radiolabelling, SomaKit TOC is administered by intravenous injection. 
A single injection is sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. 
After injection, you will be offered something to drink and asked to urinate immediately preceding the 
test. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. </p>
<p>After administration of SomaKit TOC, you should: 
- avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for 12 hours after the 
injection 
- urinate frequently in order to eliminate the medicine from your body. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more SomaKit TOC than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose under controlled conditions by the 
nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, you will 
receive the appropriate treatment. Drinking and emptying your bladder frequently will help remove the 
radioactive substance from your body more quickly. </p>
<p>Should you have any further questions on the use of SomaKit TOC, please ask the nuclear medicine 
doctor who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Although no side effects have been reported, a potential risk of allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) 
exists with SomaKit TOC. Symptoms may include: warm flush, redness of the skin, swelling, itching, 
nausea and difficulty breathing. In the event of an allergic reaction you will receive the appropriate 
treatment from your medical staff. </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): 
- Stinging near the injection site </p>
<p>The spleen is an organ located in the abdomen (belly). Some people are born with an extra spleen (an 
accessory spleen). Extra spleen tissue may also be found in the abdomen following surgery or trauma 
to the spleen (this is known as splenosis). Gallium (68Ga) edotreotide may make an accessory spleen or 
splenosis visible during medical imaging. There have been reports where this has been mistaken for a 
tumour. Your doctor may therefore perform additional scans and tests to confirm the findings on 
gallium (68Ga) edotreotide imaging (see section 2). </p>
<p>This radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk 
of cancer and hereditary abnormalities. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
