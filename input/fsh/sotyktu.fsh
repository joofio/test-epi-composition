SOTYKTU contains the active substance deucravacitinib, which belongs to a group of medicines 
called tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitors that help to reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis. </p>
<p>What SOTYKTU is used for 
SOTYKTU is used to treat adults with moderate to severe  plaque psoriasis , an inflammatory 
condition affecting the skin, which can cause red, scaly, thick, itchy, painful patches on your skin and 
can also affect your scalp and nails, hands, and feet. </p>
<p>How SOTYKTU works 
SOTYKTU works by selectively blocking the activity of an enzyme called  TYK2  (tyrosine kinase 2) 
which is involved in the process of inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, SOTYKTU 
can help to control the inflammation associated with plaque psoriasis and thereby reduce the signs 
(skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding, or flaking, redness and bleeding) and can therefore help to 
reduce symptoms such as itching, pain, burning, stinging, and skin tightness of this condition. </p>
<p>SOTYKTU has also been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with psoriasis. This means 
that the impact of your condition on daily activities, relationships and other factors should be less than 
it was before. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). 
* if you have an infection, including active tuberculosis (TB) which your doctor thinks is 
important. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking SOTYKTU: 
* if you currently have an infection that does not go away or that keeps coming back 
* if you have or have ever had tuberculosis (TB) 
* if you have cancer, because your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given SOTYKTU 
* if you have heart problems or medical conditions that make you more likely to develop heart 
disease - it is not clear if SOTYKTU increases the risk of heart disease 
* if you have had or are at risk of blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or 
lungs (pulmonary embolism). Tell your doctor if you get a painful swollen leg, chest pain, or 
shortness of breath as these can be signs of blood clots in the veins. It is not clear if SOTYKTU 
increases the risk of blood clots 
* if you have recently had or plan to have a vaccination. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using SOTYKTU. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
SOTYKTU is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been evaluated in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and SOTYKTU 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
* if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
* if you recently had or plan to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of 
vaccines (live vaccines) while using SOTYKTU. </p>
