<ul>
<li>If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: </li>
<li>Rifampicin (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); </li>
<li>St. John s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); </li>
<li>Carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures). </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these conditions apply to you, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Sovaldi is always taken with other medicines to treat hepatitis C (see section 1 above). Talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine if you: </p>
<ul>
<li>currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat irregular 
heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor may 
consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Sovaldi is 
needed, you may require additional heart monitoring; </li>
<li>have liver problems other than hepatitis C, e.g. if you are awaiting a liver transplantation; </li>
<li>have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to 
monitor you more closely; </li>
<li>have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment 
of your diabetes medication after starting Sovaldi. Some diabetic patients have experienced low 
sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like Sovaldi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines 
for heart problems and during treatment you experience: 
* slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; 
* shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; 
* chest-pain; 
* light-headedness; 
* palpitations 
* near fainting or fainting </p>
<p>Blood tests 
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Sovaldi. This is so your 
doctor can: 
* Decide what other medicines you should take with Sovaldi and for how long; 
* Confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C virus. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Sovaldi in children under 
3 years of age has not yet been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sovaldi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  </p>
<p>Warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists are used to thin the blood. Your 
doctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. </p>
<p>Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other 
medications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Sovaldi. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about taking Sovaldi if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* Oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); 
* Modafinil (a medicine to treat people with narcolepsy to help them stay awake). 
* Rifapentine (a medicine used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); 
This is because they may make Sovaldi work less well. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: 
* amiodarone, used to treat irregular heartbeats. </p>
<p>If you are not sure of what medicines can be taken with Sovaldi, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and contraception 
Pregnancy must be avoided due to the use of Sovaldi together with ribavirin. It is very important that 
you read the "Pregnancy" section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ribavirin can be very 
damaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, special precautions in sexual activity must be taken if there is 
any chance for pregnancy to occur. </p>
<ul>
<li>Sovaldi is commonly used together with ribavirin. Ribavirin can damage your unborn baby. It is 
therefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this 
therapy. </li>
<li>You or your partner must use an effective birth control method during treatment and 
afterwards. It is very important that you read the  Pregnancy  section in the ribavirin package 
leaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for an effective contraceptive method suitable for you. </li>
<li>If you or your partner become pregnant during Sovaldi treatment or in the months that follow, 
you must contact your doctor immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Sovaldi. It is not known whether sofosbuvir, the 
active substance of Sovaldi, passes into human breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
When taking Sovaldi together with other medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, patients 
have reported tiredness, dizziness, blurred vision and reduced attention. If you feel tired, dizzy, have 
blurred vision or reduced attention after taking Sovaldi you should not take part in activities such as 
driving, riding a bike or operating machines. </p>
<p>Sovaldi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
