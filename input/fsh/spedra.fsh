phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Spedra is a treatment for adult men suffering from 
erectile dysfunction (also known as impotence). This is when you cannot get, or keep a hard, erect 
penis suitable for sexual activity. </p>
<p>Spedra works by helping the blood vessels in your penis to relax. This increases the blood flow into 
your penis, helping it stay hard and erect when you get sexually excited. Spedra does not cure your 
condition. </p>
<p>It is important to note that Spedra only works if you are sexually stimulated. You and your partner will 
still need to use foreplay to get ready for sex   just as you would if you were not taking a medicine to 
help you. </p>
<p>Spedra will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction. Spedra is not for women. </p>         </div>"""

trinitrate. Spedra can increase the effects of these medicines and severely lower your blood 
pressure </li>
<li>If you are taking   s for HIV or AIDS such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir or 
atazanavir </li>
<li>If you are taking medicines for fungal infections such as ketoconazole, itraconazole or

ischemic optic neuropathy [NAION]) </li>
<li>If certain serious eye problems run in your family (such as retinitis pigmentosa). </li>
<li>If you are taking riociguat. This medicine is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., 
high blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., 
high blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors have been shown to 
increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell 
your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not take Spedra if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking Spedra. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Spedra: 
* If you have heart trouble. It may be risky for you to have sexual intercourse 
* If you suffer from priapism, that is a persistent erection lasting 4 hours or more. This can 
happen in men with conditions like sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma or leukaemia. 
* If you have a physical condition that affects the shape of your penis (such as angulation, 
Peyronie s disease or cavernosal fibrosis) 
* If you have any bleeding disorder or active peptic ulceration. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Spedra. Check with 
your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Problems with your sight or hearing 
Some men taking medicines like Spedra have had problems with their sight and hearing   see  Serious 
side effects  in section 4 for more details. It is not known if these problems are related directly to 
Spedra, other diseases that you may have or a combination of factors. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Spedra should not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Spedra </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Spedra can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other 
medicines can affect the way Spedra works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor and do not take Spedra if you are taking  nitrate  medicines for chest 
pain (angina) such as amyl nitrite or glyceryl trinitrate. Spedra has been shown to increase the effects 
of these medicines and severely lower your blood pressure. Also do not take Spedra if you are taking 
medicines for HIV or AIDS such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir or atazanavir or if you 
are taking medicines for fungal infections such as ketoconazole, itraconazole or voriconazole or 
certain antibiotics for bacterial infections, such as clarithromycin or telithromycin (see beginning of 
section 2 under  Do not take Spedra ). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* so called  alpha-blockers    for prostate problems or for lowering your high blood pressure 
* medicines for an irregular heartbeat ( arrhythmia ) such as quinidine, procainamide, 
amiodarone or sotalol 
* antibiotics for infections such as erythromycin 
* phenobarbital or primidone   for epilepsy 
* carbamazepine   for epilepsy, to stabilise your mood or for certain types of pain 
* other medicines that may reduce the breakdown of Spedra in the body ( moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors ) including amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and 
verapamil. 
* riociguat </p>
<p>Do not use Spedra together with other treatments for erectile dysfunction such as sildenafil, tadalafil or 
vardenafil. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Spedra. Check with 
your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Spedra with drink and alcohol </p>
<p>Grapefruit juice can increase exposure to the medicine and should be avoided within 24 hours prior to 
taking Spedra. 
Drinking alcohol at the same time as taking Spedra may increase your heart rate and lower your blood 
pressure. You may feel dizzy (especially when standing), have a headache or feel your heart beating in 
your chest (palpitations). Drinking alcohol may also decrease your ability to get an erection. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>There was no effect on sperm movement or structure after single 200 mg oral doses of avanafil in 
healthy volunteers. </p>
<p>The repeated oral administration of avanafil 100 mg over a period of 26 weeks to healthy volunteers 
and adult males with mild erectile dysfunction was not associated with any untoward effects on sperm 
concentration, count, motility, or morphology. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Spedra can make you feel dizzy or affect your vision. If this happens, do not drive, cycle, use tools or 
machines. </p>         </div>"""
