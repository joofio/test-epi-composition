<p>It is used in combination with another medicine (dabrafenib dispersible tablets) in children aged 1 year 
and older to treat a type of brain tumour called glioma. </p>
<p>Spexotras can be used in patients with: 
* low-grade glioma 
* high-grade glioma when the patient has received at least one radiation and/or chemotherapy 
treatment. </p>
<p>Spexotras in combination with dabrafenib dispersible tablets is used to treat patients whose brain 
tumour has a specific mutation (change) in the so-called BRAF gene. This mutation causes the body to 
make faulty proteins which in turn may cause the tumour to develop. The doctor will test for this 
mutation before starting treatment. </p>
<p>In combination with dabrafenib, Spexotras targets these faulty proteins and slows down or stops the 
development of the tumour. Also read the leaflet for dabrafenib dispersible tablets. </p>         </div>"""

* has or has had any lung or breathing problems, including difficulty in breathing often 
accompanied by a dry cough, shortness of breath and fatigue.

* has or has had any liver problems. 
* has or has had any kidney problems. 
* has or has had any gastrointestinal problems such as diverticulitis (inflamed pouches in the 
colon) or metastases to the gastrointestinal tract. </p>
<p>Before your child starts taking Spexotras, during and after their treatment, the doctor will make checks 
to avoid complications. </p>
<p>Skin examination

with surgery and the treatment can be continued without interruption The doctor may check your 
child s skin before and regularly during treatment. </p>
<p>Check your child s skin monthly during the treatment and for 6 months after they stop taking this 
medicine. Tell the doctor as soon as possible if you notice any changes to your child s skin such as a 
new wart, skin sore or reddish bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in the size or colour of a 
mole. </p>
<p>Children younger than 1 year old 
Spexotras in combination with dabrafenib dispersible tablets has not been tested in children younger 
than 1 year old. Therefore, Spexotras is not recommended in this age group. </p>
<p>Patients older than 18 years of age 
Information on treating patients older than 18 years of age with glioma is limited, therefore continued 
treatment into adulthood should be assessed by the doctor. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Spexotras 
Before starting treatment, tell the doctor, pharmacist or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken 
or might take any other medicines, including medicines used to thin the blood or any other medicines 
obtained without a prescription. </p>

(contraception) while they are taking Spexotras and for at least 16 weeks after they stop taking 
it.

while taking Spexotras in combination with dabrafenib dispersible tablets. An alternative 
effective method of birth control should be used to avoid the risk of pregnancy while taking this 
combination of medicines. Ask the doctor or nurse for advice. </p>
