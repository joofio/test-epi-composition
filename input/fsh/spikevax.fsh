  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Spikevax is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is given to adults and 
children aged 6 months and older. The active substance in Spikevax is mRNA encoding the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles. </p>
<p>As Spikevax does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID-19.<br />
How the vaccine works<br />
Spikevax stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the 
body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID-19. Spikevax uses a 
substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in the body can 
use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike 
protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax if: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine 
injection or after you were given Spikevax in the past.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have a very weak or compromised immune system </p>
</li>
<li>you have ever fainted following any needle injection. </li>
<li>you have a bleeding disorder  </li>
<li>you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a 
mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold </li>
<li>you have any serious illness  </li>
<li>if you have anxiety related to injections </li>
</ul>
<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis 
(inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Spikevax (see section 4).  </p>
<p>These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred 
within 14 days. They have been observed more often in younger males, and more often after the 
second dose compared to the first dose.  </p>
<p>Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and 
fatal cases have been seen. </p>
<p>Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as 
breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.  </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse before you are given Spikevax. </p>
<p>Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups 
A few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare-ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels 
(capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low 
blood pressure) have been reported following vaccination with Spikevax. If you have previously had 
episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given Spikevax.  </p>
<p>Duration of protection 
As with any vaccine, the primary 2-dose vaccination course of Spikevax may not fully protect all those 
who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. </p>
<p>Children<br />
Spikevax is not recommended for children aged under 6 months. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Spikevax 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Spikevax may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how 
Spikevax works. </p>
<p>Immunocompromised individuals 
If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Spikevax. The efficacy of Spikevax 
even after a third dose may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. In these cases, you 
should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close 
contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with 
your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you 
receive this vaccine. Spikevax can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from 
pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax during the second and third trimester have not shown 
negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or 
the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for 
miscarriage has been seen.  </p>
<p>Spikevax can be given during breastfeeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the 
vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.  </p>
<p>Spikevax contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""
