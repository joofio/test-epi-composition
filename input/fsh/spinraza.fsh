antisense oligonucleotides. Spinraza is used to treat a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA). </p>
<p>Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by a shortage of a protein called survival motor neuron (SMN) in 
the body. This results in the loss of nerve cells in the spine, leading to weakness of the muscles in the 
shoulders, hips, thighs and upper back. It may also weaken the muscles used for breathing and 
swallowing. </p>
<p>Spinraza works by helping the body to produce more of the SMN protein that people with SMA are 
lacking. This reduces the loss of nerve cells and so may improve muscle strength. </p>         </div>"""

* If you or your child are allergic to nusinersen or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given Spinraza. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
There is a risk of side effects occuring after Spinraza is given by a lumbar puncture procedure (see 
section 3). This can include headaches, vomiting and back pain. There may also be difficulties with 
giving a medicine by this method in very young patients and those with scoliosis (twisted and curved 
spine). </p>
<p>Other products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the cells 
in the blood which help clotting. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide 
to do a blood test to check that your or your child s blood can clot properly. This may not be required 
every time you or your child are given Spinraza. </p>
<p>Other products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the 
kidneys. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide to do a urine test to 
check that your or your child s kidneys are working normally. This may not be required every time 
you or your child are given Spinraza. </p>
<p>There have been a small number of reports of patients developing hydrocephalus (a build-up of too 
much fluid around the brain) after Spinraza is given. Some of these patients had needed to have a 
device called a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt implanted to treat the hydrocephalus. If you notice any 
symptoms of increase in head size, decreased consciousness, persistent nausea, vomiting or headache; 
or other symptoms that cause you concern, please inform your or your child s doctor to seek necessary 
treatment. The benefits and risks of continuing Spinraza whilst having a "ventriculo-peritoneal shunt" 
in place are not known at present. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you or your child are given Spinraza. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Spinraza 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken any, or might take any other 
medicines in future. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Spinraza 
during pregnancy and breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Spinraza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Spinraza contains a small amount of sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml vial, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free  and can be used by people on a sodium-restricted diet. </p>
<p>Spinraza contains a small amount of potassium 
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 5 ml vial, i.e. essentially  potassium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Spinraza is given by injection into the lower back. This injection, called a lumbar puncture, is done by 
inserting a needle into the space around the spinal cord. This will be done by a doctor experienced in 
doing lumbar punctures. You or your child may also be given a medicine to make you relax or sleep 
during the procedure. </p>
<p>How long to use Spinraza 
Your doctor will tell you how long you or your child need to receive Spinraza. Don t stop treatment 
with Spinraza unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you or your child misses an injection 
If you or your child miss a dose of Spinraza, speak with your doctor so that Spinraza can be given as 
soon as possible. </p>
