leukaemia (CML) in adults, adolescents and children at least 1 year of age. Leukaemia is a cancer of 
white blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight infection. In people with CML, 
white cells called granulocytes start growing out of control. SPRYCEL inhibits the growth of these 
leukaemic cells. </p>
<p>SPRYCEL is also used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents and children at least 1 year of age, and lymphoid blast CML in 
adults who are not benefiting from prior therapies. In people with ALL, white cells called lymphocytes 
multiply too quickly and live too long. SPRYCEL inhibits the growth of these leukaemic cells. </p>

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using SPRYCEL<br />
* if you are taking medicines to thin the blood or prevent clots (see "Other medicines and 
SPRYCEL") </p>
<p>108
* if you have a liver or heart problem, or used to have one

may be a sign of fluid retention in the lungs or chest (which can be more common in patients 
aged 65 years and older), or due to changes in the blood vessels supplying the lungs 
* if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because SPRYCEL 
could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will 
be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. 
* if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking SPRYCEL, 
contact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA). </p>
<p>Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check whether SPRYCEL is having the desired 
effect. You will also have blood tests regularly while you are taking SPRYCEL. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than one year of age. There is limited experience with 
the use of SPRYCEL in this age group. Bone growth and development will be closely monitored in 
children taking SPRYCEL. </p>

<p>The starting dose recommended for adult patients with chronic phase CML is 100 mg once a 
day. </p>
<p>The starting dose recommended for adult patients with accelerated or blast crisis CML or Ph+ 
ALL is 140 mg once a day. </p>
<p>Dosing for children with chronic phase CML or Ph+ ALL is on the basis of body weight. 
SPRYCEL is administered orally once daily in the form of either SPRYCEL tablets or SPRYCEL 
powder for oral suspension. SPRYCEL tablets are not recommended for patients weighing less than 
10 kg. The powder for oral suspension should be used for patients weighing less than 10 kg and 
patients who cannot swallow tablets. A change in dose may occur when switching between 
formulations (i.e., tablets and powder for oral suspension), so you should not switch from one to the 
other. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide the right formulation and dose based on your weight, any side effects and 
response to treatment. The starting dose of SPRYCEL for children is calculated by body weight as 
shown below: </p>

a The tablet is not recommended for patients weighing less than 10 kg; the powder for oral suspension should be used for 
these patients. </p>
<p>There is no dose recommendation for SPRYCEL with children under 1 year of age.  </p>
<p>Depending on how you respond to the treatment, your doctor may suggest a higher or lower dose, or 
even stopping treatment briefly. For higher or lower doses, you may need to take combinations of the 
different tablet strengths. </p>
<p>The tablets may come in packs with calendar blisters. These are blisters showing the days of the 
week. There are arrows to show the next tablet to be taken according to your treatment schedule. </p>
<p>How to take SPRYCEL 
Take your tablets at the same time every day. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not crush, cut or 
chew them. Do not take dispersed tablets. You cannot be sure you will receive the correct dose if you 
crush, cut, chew or disperse the tablets. SPRYCEL tablets can be taken with or without a meal. </p>
<p>Special handling instructions for SPRYCEL 
It is unlikely that the SPRYCEL tablets will get broken. But if they do, persons other than the patient 
should use gloves when handling SPRYCEL. </p>
<p>How long to take SPRYCEL 
Take SPRYCEL daily until your doctor tells you to stop. Make sure you take SPRYCEL for as long as 
it is prescribed. </p>

<p>If you take more SPRYCEL than you should 
If you have accidentally taken too many tablets, talk to your doctor immediately. You may require
