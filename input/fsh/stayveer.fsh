  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>STAYVEER tablets contain bosentan, which blocks a naturally occurring hormone called endothelin-1 
(ET-1), which causes blood vessels to narrow. STAYVEER therefore causes blood vessels to expand and 
belongs to the class of medicines called  endothelin receptor antagonists .
STAYVEER is used to treat:</p>
<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): PAH is a disease of severe narrowing of the blood 
vessels in the lungs resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) 
that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. This pressure reduces the amount of oxygen that can 
get into the blood in the lungs, making physical activity more difficult. STAYVEER widens the 
pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. This lowers the 
blood pressure and relieves the symptoms.
STAYVEER is used to treat patients with class III PAH to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry 
out physical activity) and symptoms. The  class  reflects the seriousness of the disease:  class III  involves 
marked limitation of physical activity. Some improvements have also been shown in patients with class II 
PAH.  Class II  involves slight limitation of physical activity. The PAH for which STAYVEER is 
indicated can be:</p>
<p>primary (with no identified cause or familial);</p>
<p>caused by scleroderma (also called systemic sclerosis, a disease where there is abnormal growth of 
the connective tissue that supports the skin and other organs);</p>
<p>caused by congenital (inborn) heart defects with shunts (abnormal passageways) causing abnormal 
flow of blood through the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Digital ulcers: (sores on the fingers and toes) in adult patients with a condition called scleroderma. 
STAYVEER reduces the number of new finger and toe ulcers that appear.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Tests your doctor will do before treatment</p>
<p>a blood test to check your liver function</p>
<p>a blood test to check for anaemia (low haemoglobin)</p>
<p>a pregnancy test if you are a woman of childbearing potential
Some patients taking STAYVEER have been found to have abnormal liver function tests and anaemia 
(low haemoglobin).
Tests your doctor will do during treatment
During treatment with STAYVEER, your doctor will arrange for regular blood tests to check for changes 
in your liver function and haemoglobin level.
For all these tests please refer also to the Patient Alert Card (inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets). It is 
important that you have these regular blood tests as long as you are taking STAYVEER. We suggest you 
write the date of your most recent test and also of your next test (ask your doctor for the date) on the 
Patient Alert Card, to help you remember when your next test is due.
Blood tests for liver function
These will be done every month for the duration of treatment with STAYVEER. After an increase in dose 
an additional test will be done after 2 weeks.
Blood tests for anaemia
These will be done every month for the first 4 months of treatment, then every 3 months after that, as 
patients taking STAYVEER may get anaemia.
If these results are abnormal, your doctor may decide to reduce your dose or stop treatment with 
STAYVEER and to perform further tests to investigate the cause.
Children and adolescents
STAYVEER is not recommended in paediatric patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer 
disease. Please see also section </p>         </div>"""

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are 
taking:</p>
<p>cyclosporine A (a medicine used after transplants and to treat psoriasis), which must not be used 
together with STAYVEER.</p>
<p>sirolimus or tacrolimus, which are medicines used after transplants, as these are not recommended 
to be used together with STAYVEER.</p>
<p>glibenclamide (a diabetes medicine), rifampicin (a tuberculosis medicine), fluconazole (a medicine 
against fungal infections), ketoconazole (a medicine used to treat Cushing s syndrome), or
nevirapine (an HIV medicine), as these medicines are not recommended to be used together with 
STAYVEER.</p>
<p>other medicines for the treatment of HIV infection, which may require special monitoring if used 
together with STAYVEER.</p>
<p>hormonal contraceptives, which are not effective as the sole method of contraception when you take 
STAYVEER. Inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets you will find a Patient Alert Card which you 
should read carefully. Your doctor and/or gynaecologist will establish the contraception which is 
appropriate for you.</p>
<p>other medications for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension: sildenafil and tadalafil;</p>
<p>warfarin (an anticoagulant agent);</p>
<p>simvastatin (used to treat hypercholesterolaemia).
Driving and using machines
STAYVEER has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, 
STAYVEER can induce hypotension (decrease of your blood pressure) which can make you feel dizzy, 
affect your vision and affect your ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, if you feel dizzy or that 
your vision is blurred while taking STAYVEER, do not drive or operate any tools or machines.
Women of childbearing age
Do NOT take STAYVEER if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Pregnancy tests
STAYVEER may harm unborn babies conceived before starting or during treatment. If you are a woman 
who could become pregnant, your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start taking 
STAYVEER, and regularly while you are taking STAYVEER.
Contraceptives
If it is possible that you could become pregnant, use a reliable form of birth control (contraception) while 
you are taking STAYVEER. Your doctor or gynaecologist will advise you about reliable contraceptive 
methods while taking STAYVEER. Because STAYVEER may make hormonal contraception (e.g., oral, 
injection, implant, or skin patches) ineffective, this method on its own is not reliable. Therefore, if you use 
hormonal contraceptives you must also use a barrier method (e.g., female condom, diaphragm, 
contraceptive sponge, or your partner must also use a condom). Inside your pack of STAYVEER tablets 
you will find a Patient Alert Card. You should complete this card and take it to your doctor at your next 
visit so that your doctor or gynaecologist can assess whether you need additional or alternative reliable 
contraceptive methods. Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended while you are taking STAYVEER and 
are of childbearing age.
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking STAYVEER, or plan to 
become pregnant in the near future.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are breast-feeding. You are advised to stop breast-feeding if 
STAYVEER is prescribed for you, because it is not known whether this medicine passes into breast milk.
Fertility
If you are a man taking STAYVEER, it is possible that this medicine may lower your sperm count. It 
cannot be excluded that this may affect your ability to father a child. Talk to your doctor if you have any 
questions or concerns about this.
STAYVEER contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

If you take more tablets than you have been told to take, contact your doctor immediately.
If you forget to take STAYVEER
If you forget to take STAYVEER, take a dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your tablets 
at the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten tablets.
If you stop taking STAYVEER
Suddenly stopping your treatment with STAYVEER may lead to your symptoms getting worse. Do not 
stop taking STAYVEER unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to reduce the dose over 
a few days before stopping completely.
