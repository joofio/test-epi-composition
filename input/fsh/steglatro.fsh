  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Steglatro is
Steglatro contains the active substance ertugliflozin.
Steglatro is a member of a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
What Steglatro is used for</p>
<p>Steglatro lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2
diabetes. </p>
<p>It can also help prevent heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Steglatro can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. </p>
<p>You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Steglatro.
How Steglatro works
Ertugliflozin works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar to be
removed in your urine. 
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that
your body produces does not work as well as it should. This leads to a high level of sugar in your
blood. When this happens, this can lead to serious medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease,
blindness and poor circulation.</p>         </div>"""

section 6).
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before and while taking Steglatro if you:</p>
<p>have kidney problems. Your doctor may do blood tests to check how well your kidneys are
working.</p>
<p>have or have had urinary tract infections.</p>
<p>have or have had yeast infections of the vagina or penis.</p>
<p>have type 1 diabetes. Steglatro should not be used to treat this condition as it may increase the
risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients.</p>
<p>take other diabetes medicines; you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain
medicines.</p>
<p>might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine
production [diuretics] or lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). Ask about ways
to prevent dehydration.</p>
<p>experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and
deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet
or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat contact a doctor or the
nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of  diabetic ketoacidosis    a
problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of  ketone bodies  in your urine
or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with
prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin
dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.
It is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by
your healthcare professional. 
Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness,
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier s gangrene which destroys the tissue
under the skin. Fournier s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
When this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from
the pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your
insulin or other medicine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Urine glucose 
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on
this medicine.
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents below 18 years should not take this medicine. It is not known if this
medicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Steglatro
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor: </p>
<p>if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics). </p>
<p>if you are taking other medicines that lower the sugar in your blood, such as insulin or
medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is not known if Steglatro can harm your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor
about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. Do not use Steglatro if you are
pregnant.
It is not known if Steglatro passes into breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed
your baby if you take Steglatro. Do not use Steglatro if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, taking
this medicine in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas
can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as
shaking, sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not
drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Steglatro.
Steglatro contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor
before taking this medicine.
Steglatro contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""
