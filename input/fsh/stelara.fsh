Stelara contains the active substance  ustekinumab , a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies 
are proteins that recognise and bind specifically to certain proteins in the body.
Stelara belongs to a group of medicines called  immunosuppressants . These medicines work by 
weakening part of the immune system.
What Stelara is used for
Stelara is used to treat the following inflammatory diseases:</p>
<p>Moderate to severe Crohn s disease - in adults</p>
<p>Moderate to severe ulcerative colitis - in adults
Crohn s disease
Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn s disease you will first be 
given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough or are intolerant to these medicines, you 
may be given Stelara to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.
Ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first 
be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough or are intolerant to these medicines, you 
may be given Stelara to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to ustekinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).</p>
<p>If you have an active infection which your doctor thinks is important.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Stelara.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Stelara. Your doctor will check how well you are 
before treatment. Make sure you tell your doctor about any illness you have before treatment. Also tell 
your doctor if you have recently been near anyone who might have tuberculosis. Your doctor will 
examine you and do a test for tuberculosis, before you have Stelara. If your doctor thinks you are at 
risk of tuberculosis, you may be given medicines to treat it.
Look out for serious side effects
Stelara can cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions and infections. You must look out 
for certain signs of illness while you are taking Stelara. See  Serious side effects  in section 4 for a full 
list of these side effects.
Before you use Stelara tell your doctor:</p>
<p>If you ever had an allergic reaction to Stelara. Ask your doctor if you are not sure.</p>
<p>If you have ever had any type of cancer   this is because immunosuppressants like Stelara 
weaken part of the immune system. This may increase the risk of cancer.</p>
<p>If you have been treated for psoriasis with other biologic medicines (a medicine produced 
from a biological source and usually given by injection)   the risk of cancer may be higher.</p>
<p>If you have or have had a recent infection or if you have any abnormal skin openings 
(fistulae).</p>
<p>If you have any new or changing lesions within psoriasis areas or on normal skin.</p>
<p>If you are having any other treatment for psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis   such as 
another immunosuppressant or phototherapy (when your body is treated with a type of 
ultraviolet (UV) light). These treatments may also weaken part of the immune system. Using 
these therapies together with Stelara has not been studied. However it is possible it may increase 
the chance of diseases related to a weaker immune system.</p>
<p>If you are having or have ever had injections to treat allergies   it is not known if Stelara 
may affect these.</p>
<p>If you are 65 years of age or over   you may be more likely to get infections.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Stelara.
Some patients have experienced lupus-like reactions including skin lupus or lupus-like syndrome 
during treatment with ustekinumab. Talk to your doctor right away if you experience a red, raised, 
scaly rash sometimes with a darker border, in areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun or with joint 
pains.
Heart attack and strokes
Heart attack and strokes have been observed in a study in patients with psoriasis treated with Stelara. 
Your doctor will regularly check your risk factors for heart disease and stroke in order to ensure that 
they are appropriately treated. Seek medical attention right away if you develop chest pain, weakness 
or abnormal sensation on one side of your body, facial droop, or speech or visual abnormalities.
Children and adolescents
Stelara is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age with Crohn s disease or 
ulcerative colitis because it has not been studied in this age group.
Other medicines, vaccines and Stelara
Tell your doctor or pharmacist:</p>
<p>If you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p>
<p>If you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. Some types of vaccines (live 
vaccines) should not be given while using Stelara.</p>
<p>If you received Stelara while pregnant, tell your baby s doctor about your Stelara treatment 
before the baby receives any vaccine, including live vaccines, such as the BCG vaccine (used to 
prevent tuberculosis). Live vaccines are not recommended for your baby in the first six months 
after birth if you received Stelara during the pregnancy unless your baby s doctor recommends 
otherwise.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>It is preferable to avoid the use of Stelara in pregnancy. The effects of Stelara in pregnant 
women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid 
becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Stelara and for at least 
15 weeks after the last Stelara treatment.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby.</p>
<p>Stelara can pass across the placenta to the unborn baby. If you received Stelara during your 
pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection.</p>
<p>It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals if you 
received Stelara during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. Live vaccines 
such as the BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) are not recommended for your baby in 
the first six months after birth if you received Stelara during the pregnancy unless your baby s 
doctor recommends otherwise.</p>
<p>Ustekinumab may pass into breast milk in very small amounts. Talk to your doctor if you are 
breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed. You and your doctor should decide if you should 
breast-feed or use Stelara - do not do both.
Driving and using machines
Stelara has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Stelara contains sodium
Stelara contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . 
However, before Stelara is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that contains sodium. Talk to your 
doctor if you are on a low salt diet.</p>         </div>"""

Serious side effects
Some patients may have serious side effects that may need urgent treatment.
Allergic reactions   these may need urgent treatment. Tell your doctor or get emergency 
medical help straight away if you notice any of the following signs.</p>
<p>Serious allergic reactions ( anaphylaxis ) are rare in people taking Stelara (may affect up 
to 1 in 1,000 people). Signs include:<em> difficulty breathing or swallowing</em> low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness or light-headedness* swelling of the face, lips, mouth or throat.</p>
<p>Common signs of an allergic reaction include skin rash and hives (these may affect up to 
1 in 100 people).
Infusion-related reactions   If you are being treated for Crohn s disease or ulcerative 
colitis, the first dose of Stelara is given through a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion). 
Some patients have experienced serious allergic reactions during the infusion.
In rare cases, allergic lung reactions and lung inflammation have been reported in patients 
who receive ustekinumab. Tell your doctor right away if you develop symptoms such as 
cough, shortness of breath, and fever.
If you have a serious allergic reaction, your doctor may decide that you should not use Stelara 
again.
Infections   these may need urgent treatment. Tell your doctor straight away if you notice 
any of the following signs.</p>
<p>Infections of the nose or throat and common cold are common (may affect up to 1 in 
10 people)</p>
<p>Infections of the chest are uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)</p>

100 people)</p>
<p>Shingles (a type of painful rash with blisters) are uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 
100 people)
Stelara may make you less able to fight infections. Some infections could become serious and 
may include infections caused by viruses, fungi, bacteria (including tuberculosis), or parasites, 
including infections that mainly occur in people with a weakened immune system (opportunistic 
infections). Opportunistic infections of the brain (encephalitis, meningitis), lungs, and eye have 
been reported in patients receiving treatment with ustekinumab.
You must look out for signs of infection while you are using Stelara. These include:</p>
<p>fever, flu-like symptoms, night sweats, weight loss</p>
<p>feeling tired or short of breath; cough which will not go away</p>
<p>warm, red and painful skin, or a painful skin rash with blisters</p>
<p>burning when passing water</p>
<p>diarrhoea</p>
<p>visual disturbance or vision loss</p>
<p>headache, neck stiffness, light sensitivity, nausea or confusion.
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of these signs of infection. These may be signs 
of infections such as chest infections, skin infections, shingles or opportunistic infections that 
could have serious complications. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection that will 
not go away or keeps coming back. Your doctor may decide that you should not use Stelara 
until the infection goes away. Also tell your doctor if you have any open cuts or sores as they 
might get infected.
Shedding of skin   increase in redness and shedding of skin over a larger area of the body 
may be symptoms of erythrodermic psoriasis or exfoliative dermatitis, which are serious 
skin conditions. You should tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of these signs.
