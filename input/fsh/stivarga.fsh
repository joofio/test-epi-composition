unborn baby. </p>
<p>Both women of childbearing potential and men should use effective contraception during treatment

<p>The recommended daily dose in adults is 4 tablets of Stivarga 40 mg (160 mg regorafenib). Your 
doctor may change your dose. Take the dose of Stivarga that your doctor prescribes for you. 
Your doctor will usually ask you to take Stivarga for 3 weeks and then to stop for 1 week. This is 
1 cycle of treatment.  </p>
<p>Take Stivarga at the same time each day after a light (low-fat) meal. Swallow the tablet whole with 
water after a light meal that contains less than 30% fat. An example of a light (low-fat) meal would 
include 1 portion of cereal (about 30 g), 1 glass of skimmed milk, 1 slice of toast with jam, 1 glass of 
apple juice, and 1 cup of coffee or tea (520 calories, 2 g fat). You should not take Stivarga together 
with grapefruit juice (see also section  Taking Stivarga with food and drink ). </p>
<p>In case of vomiting after regorafenib administration, you should not take additional tablets and you 
should inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to reduce your dose or may decide to interrupt or discontinue the treatment 
permanently if necessary. You will usually take Stivarga as long as you are benefiting and not 
suffering unacceptable side effects. </p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary if you have a mildly impaired liver function. If you have a mildly 
or moderately impaired liver function while you are being treated with Stivarga, your doctor should 
monitor you closely. If your liver function is severely impaired, you should not be treated with 
Stivarga, as there are no data on the use of Stivarga in patients with a severely impaired liver function. </p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary if you have a mildly, moderately or severely impaired kidney 
function.  </p>
<p>If you take more Stivarga than you should 
Tell your doctor immediately if you have taken more than your prescribed dose. You may require 
medical attention and your doctor may tell you to stop taking Stivarga. </p>
<p>Taking too much Stivarga may make some side effects more likely or more severe, especially:</p>
<ul>
<li>skin reactions (rash, blisters, redness, pain, swelling, itching or peeling of your skin) </li>

<li>dry mouth </li>
<li>decreased appetite </li>
<li>high blood pressure (hypertension) </li>
<li>excessive tiredness (fatigue). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you forget to take Stivarga
