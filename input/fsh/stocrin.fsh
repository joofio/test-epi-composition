fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by reducing the amount of the virus in blood.
It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 years of age and older.
Your doctor has prescribed Stocrin for you because you have HIV infection. Stocrin taken in
combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in the blood. This will

from working properly.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to you doctor before taking Stocrin</li>
</ul>
<p>Stocrin must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If Stocrin is
started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another
medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time.</p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection and you may continue to develop infections or
other illnesses associated with HIV disease.</p>
<p>You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Stocrin.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or
alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal
thoughts or have strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects).</li>
<li>if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated
with anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin.
If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level
of anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while
taking Stocrin. Your doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant.</li>
<li>if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral
agents have a higher risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems.
Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is
working or may switch you to another medicine. If you have severe liver disease,
do not take Stocrin (see section 2, Do not take Stocrin).</li>
<li>if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called
prolongation of the QT interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start taking Stocrin, look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of
treatment and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks.</li>
<li>signs of confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions (false
beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others do not see or
hear). These side effects may occur months to years after beginning Stocrin
therapy. If you notice any symptoms, please inform your doctor.</li>
<li>any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or
fever, stop taking Stocrin and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while
taking another NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with Stocrin.</li>
<li>any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV
infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of
inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s
immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present
with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell
your doctor immediately.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that
occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after
you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune
disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any
symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness
beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body,
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to
seek necessary treatment.</li>
<li>bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may
develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of
blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy,
corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body
mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing
this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially
of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of
these symptoms please inform your doctor.
Children and adolescents
Stocrin is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years or weighing less than 13 kg because
it has not been adequately studied in these patients.
Other medicines and Stocrin
You must not take Stocrin with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take Stocrin, at the
start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. John s wort) which
can cause serious interactions.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other
medicines.
Stocrin may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba
extracts. As a result, the amounts of Stocrin or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This
may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases,
your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your
doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:</li>
<li>
<p>Other medicines used for HIV infection:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted
atazanavir, saquinavir or fosamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you
an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors.</p>
</li>
<li>maraviroc</li>
<li>the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir should not be
taken with Stocrin unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the
active ingredient of Stocrin.</li>
<li>Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir,
simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir.</li>
<li>Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related
mycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may
consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor
may prescribe a higher dose of Stocrin.</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals):</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>voriconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and
voriconazole may increase the amount of Stocrin in your blood. If you take these two
medicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of efavirenz
must be reduced. You must check with your doctor first.</p>
</li>
<li>itraconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood.</li>
<li>posaconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood.</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat malaria:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>artemether/lumefantrine: Stocrin may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine in
your blood.</p>
</li>
<li>atovaquone/proguanil: Stocrin may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in your
blood.</li>
<li>Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin,
phenobarbital. Stocrin can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood.
Carbamazepine may make Stocrin less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider giving
you a different anticonvulsant.</li>
<li>Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin.
Stocrin can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol
levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed.</li>
<li>Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an
alternative treatment.</li>
<li>Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of
sertraline.</li>
<li>Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may
need to change your dose of bupropion.  </li>
<li>Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines
typically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking Stocrin,
your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker.</li>
<li>Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to
prevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking Stocrin, your doctor will
closely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose.</li>
<li>Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for
example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must
also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility).
Stocrin may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in
women taking Stocrin while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been established
that the Stocrin therapy caused the contraceptive to fail.</li>
<li>Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): your doctor may
need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol.</li>
<li>Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation).</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines that impact heart rhythm:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as flecainide or metoprolol.</p>
</li>
<li>Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine.</li>
<li>Antibiotics, including the following types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole.</li>
<li>Metamizole (a medicine used to treat pain and fever).</li>
<li>Praziquantel (a medicine used to treat parasitic worm infections).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Stocrin and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your
doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting
treatment with Stocrin.
If you could get pregnant while receiving Stocrin, you need to use a reliable form of barrier
contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or
other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood
for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as
above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking Stocrin.
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are
pregnant, you should take Stocrin only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with
efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during
pregnancy. If you have taken Stocrin or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and
tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic
tests to monitor the development of your child.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Stocrin contains efavirenz and may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and drowsiness. 
If you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.
Stocrin 30 mg/mL oral solution contains benzoic acid
This medicine contains 1 mg of benzoic acid (E210) per mL.
Stocrin 30 mg/mL oral solution contains benzyl alcohol
This medicine contains benzyl alcohol (E1519) up to 0.816 mg per mL.
Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.</li>

or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will give you instructions for proper dosing.</p>
<p>The dose for adults is 24 mL once daily.</p>
<p>The dose for Stocrin may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain
medicines (see Other medicines and Stocrin).</p>
<p>Stocrin oral solution may be taken with or without food.
The dose of Stocrin oral solution in mg is not the same as for Stocrin film-coated tablets.</p>
<p>Stocrin must be taken every day.</p>
<p>Stocrin should never be used alone to treat HIV. Stocrin must always be taken in combination
with other anti-HIV medicines.
The dose of Stocrin oral solution must be measured using the oral syringe
supplied in the carton.</p>
<p>On first use, the bottle adapter must be fitted into the neck of the
bottle. To do this, remove the child-resistant cap and the foil seal. The
bottle adapter, which is already fixed to the nozzle of the syringe, can
then be fitted into the neck of the bottle and pressed firmly down.  </p>
<p>Separate the syringe from the adapter. The adapter should now fit
closely to the neck so that the cap can be replaced without removing
it.</p>
<p>With the bottle upright, fit the tip of the syringe into the bottle adapter.  </p>
<p>Turn the bottle upside down with the syringe still in place. Hold the
bottle and the syringe firmly in one hand and with the other hand pull
back the plunger slightly beyond the mark for the dose required. If air
bubbles appear in the syringe, keep the bottle upside down and slowly
push in the plunger and pull it back again. Repeat until there are no
bubbles in the syringe.</p>
<p>To measure the dose accurately, keep the bottle upside down and push
the plunger in slowly until the top of the black ring (the edge nearest
the syringe tip) lines up with the dose. Turn the bottle the right way up
and remove the syringe. Wipe the adapter and replace the cap tightly
over it.</p>
<p>Before giving the dose of the oral solution make sure that the patient
is sitting or standing upright. Put the tip of the syringe just inside the
mouth, pointing it towards the cheek. Press the plunger slowly to
allow time for the medicine to be swallowed. Rapid squirting into the
mouth may cause choking.
After use, soak the syringe in warm soapy water for at least a minute. Draw the warm soapy water into
the syringe until full and then empty completely. Repeat at least three times. Remove the plunger rod
from the barrel and thoroughly rinse both parts with warm running water. If parts of the syringe are
not clean, repeat the cleaning instructions. Allow the parts to dry completely prior to reassembly. Do
not put the syringe in a dishwasher.
Use in children and adolescents</p>
<p>The dose for children weighing 40 kg or more is 24 mL once daily.</p>
<p>The dose for children weighing less than 40 kg is calculated by body weight and is taken once
daily as shown below:
Body Weight
Stocrin oral solution (30 mg/mL)
kg
Dose (mL)
3 - &lt; 5 years
5 years or more
13 to &lt; 9
15 to &lt; 20 to &lt; 25 to &lt; 32.5
32.5 to &lt; -
  -
If you take more Stocrin than you should
If you take too much Stocrin contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep
the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken.
If you forget to take Stocrin
Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your
medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you stop taking Stocrin
When your Stocrin supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is very
important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short
time. The virus may then become harder to treat.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When
treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are
caused by Stocrin or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease
itself.
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
The most notable unwanted effects reported with Stocrin in combination with other anti-HIV
medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms. 
You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most
cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with Stocrin. Rash was more common in
children than in adults treated with Stocrin.
The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in
the first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours
after taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take Stocrin at bedtime. Some
patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the ability to think clearly. Some
patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur more often in those who have
a history of mental illness. In addition, some nervous system symptoms (e.g., confusion, slow thoughts
and physical movement, and delusions [false beliefs] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that
others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years after beginning Stocrin therapy. Always notify
your doctor immediately if you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking Stocrin.
Diarrhoea occurred in children who took Stocrin oral solution and nelfinavir in combination with other
antiretroviral medicines.
