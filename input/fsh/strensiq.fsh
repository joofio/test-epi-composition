Strensiq is a medicine used to treat the inherited disease hypophosphatasia that started in childhood. It 
contains the active substance asfotase alfa. </p>
<p>What is hypophosphatasia 
Patients with hypophosphatasia have low levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase that is 
important for various body functions, including the proper hardening of bones and teeth. Patients have 
problems with bone growth and strength, which can lead to broken bones, bone pain, and difficulty 
walking, as well as difficulties with breathing and a risk of seizures (fits). </p>
<p>What is Strensiq used for 
The active substance in Strensiq can replace the missing enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) in 
hypophosphatasia. It is used for long-term enzyme replacement treatment to manage symptoms. </p>
<p>What benefits of Strensiq have been shown in clinical studies 
Strensiq has shown benefits for patients’ mineralization of the skeleton and growth. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Strensiq 
If you are severely allergic to asfotase alfa (see section ‘Warnings and precautions’ below) or any of 
the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before using Strensiq. 
* Patients receiving asfotase alfa have had allergic reactions including life threatening allergic 
reactions requiring medical treatment similar to anaphylaxis. Patients who experienced 
anaphylaxis-like symptoms had difficulty breathing, choking sensation, nausea, swelling around 
the eyes, and dizziness. The reactions occurred within minutes after taking asfotase alfa, and can 
occur in patients who were taking asfotase alfa for more than one year. If you experience any of 
these symptoms, discontinue Strensiq and seek medical help immediately. 
Should you experience anaphylactic reaction, or an event with similar symptoms, your doctor 
will discuss with you the next steps and the possibility to restart Strensiq under medical 
supervision. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor.  <br />
<em> The development of blood proteins against Strensiq, also called anti-drug antibodies, may occur 
during the treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience decreased efficacy with Strensiq. 
* Fatty lumps or decreased fatty tissue on the surface of the skin (localized lipodystrophy) have 
been reported at injection sites after several months in patients using Strensiq. Read section 3 
carefully to know the injection recommendations. This is important to rotate the injection from 
among the following sites to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy: abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid. 
* In studies, some eye-related side-effects (e.g. calcium build-up on the eye [conjunctival and 
corneal calcification]) have been reported both in patients using Strensiq and those who were 
not, probably associated with hypophosphatasia. Talk to your doctor in case of problems with 
your vision. 
* Early fusion of the bones of the head (craniosynostosis) in children below 5 years of age has 
been reported in clinical studies of infants with hypophosphatasia, with and without use of 
Strensiq. Talk to your doctor if you notice any change in the shape of your infant’s head. 
* If you are treated with Strensiq, you may experience a reaction at the injection site (pain, 
nodule, rash, discoloration) during the injection of the medicine or during the hours following 
the injection. If you experience any severe reaction at the injection site, tell your doctor 
immediately. 
* Increase of parathyroid hormone concentration and low calcium levels have been reported in 
studies. As a consequence, your doctor may ask you to take supplements of calcium and oral 
vitamin D if needed.<br />
</em> Weight gain may occur during your treatment with Strensiq. Your doctor will provide dietary 
advice as necessary. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Strensiq 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>If you need to undergo laboratory tests (giving blood for testing), tell your doctor that you are treated 
with Strensiq. Strensiq may cause some tests to show wrongly higher or lower results. Therefore, 
another type of test may need to be used if you are treated with Strensiq.   </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
Strensiq should not be used during pregnancy. The use of effective birth control during treatment 
should be considered in women who are able to get pregnant.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
It is not known whether Strensiq can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding 
or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to 
stop taking Strensiq, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Strensiq to 
the mother. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine is not expected to have any effect on the ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Strensiq 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, which means it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

How to use Strensiq will be explained to you by a doctor who is experienced in the management of 
patients with metabolic or bone related diseases. After being trained by the doctor or specialized nurse, 
you can inject Strensiq yourself at home. </p>
<p>Dose 
* The dose you receive is based on your body weight. 
* The correct dose will be calculated by your doctor and consists of a total of 6 mg of asfotase 
alfa per kg of body weight every week, given either as an injection of 1 mg/kg asfotase alfa 6 
times per week or as 2 mg/kg asfotase alfa 3 times per week depending on the recommendation 
of your doctor. Each dose will be administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneous), (see 
the dosing chart below for detailed information on the volume to be injected, and the type of 
vials to be used, based on your weight).<br />
* Doses will need to be adjusted regularly by your doctor as the body weight changes. 
* The maximum volume per injection should not exceed 1 ml. If more than 1 ml is required, you 
need to do multiple injections immediately one after the other. </p>
