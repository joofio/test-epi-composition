  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only.  </p>
<p>Striascan contains the active substance ioflupane (123I) which is used to help identify (diagnose) conditions 
in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called  radiopharmaceuticals , which contain a small 
amount of radioactivity. 
* When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a 
short time. 
* Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body using 
special cameras. 
* A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is 
inside the organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information about how that organ 
is working. </p>
<p>Striascan is used only to identify illness. When this medicine is injected into a patient, it is carried around 
the body in the blood and collects in a small area of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in: </p>
<ul>
<li>parkinsonism (including Parkinson s disease) and </li>
<li>dementia with Lewy bodies. </li>
</ul>
<p>A scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may 
feel that the scan would help in finding out more about your condition and deciding on possible treatment. </p>
<p>When Striascan is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than in 
some types of X-ray investigation. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the 
clinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to 
these small amounts of radiation. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using this medicine if you have moderate or severe 
problems with your kidneys or liver. </p>
<p>Before administration of Striascan you should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination 
in order to urinate as often as possible during the first hours after the study.   </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Striascan is not recommended for children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Striascan 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. 
Some medicines or substances can affect the way that this medicine works. 
These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>bupropion (used to treat depression (sadness)) </li>
<li>benzatropine (used to treat Parkinson s disease) </li>
<li>mazindol (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity) </li>
<li>sertraline (used to treat depression (sadness)) </li>
<li>methylphenidate (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness)) </li>
<li>phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity) </li>
<li>amfetamine (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness); also a 
drug of abuse) </li>
<li>cocaine (sometimes used as an anaesthetic for nose surgery; also a drug of abuse) </li>
</ul>
<p>Some medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may ask you to stop taking 
them for a short time before you receive Striascan. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of Striascan if there is a 
possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding.<br />
When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, do not use Striascan. This is because the child may receive some of the 
radioactivity.  Alternative techniques which do not involve radioactivity should be considered. </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of this product or ask you to 
stop breast-feeding. It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) you are given is passed into breast milk. 
* You should not breast-feed your child for 3 days after this product is given. 
* Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away any 
breast milk you have expressed. 
* You will need to continue to do this for 3 days, until the radioactivity is no longer in your body. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Striascan will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>
<p>Striascan contains alcohol (ethanol): up to 197 mg of alcohol in each dose which is equivalent to 39.5 
mg/mL (5% by volume). The amount in 5 mL of this medicine is equivalent to 5 mL beer or 2 mL wine. 
The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radioactivity. Striascan will always be used in a 
hospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and 
qualified to use it safely. They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of this medicine. 
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Striascan to be used 
in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information.<br />
The quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult ranges from 110 to 185 MBq 
(megabecquerel or MBq, the unit used to measure radioactivity). </p>
<p>Administration of Striascan and conduct of the procedure 
Before you receive Striascan, your nuclear medicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liquid that 
contain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building-up in your thyroid gland. It is important that you take 
the tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you. </p>
<p>Striascan is given to you as an injection, usually into a vein in your arm. A single injection is enough.  </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure<br />
The camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours after the injection of this product. Your nuclear 
medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. </p>
<p>After administration of Striascan, you should urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from 
your body.  </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving 
this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you are given more Striascan than you should 
Since this product is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an 
overdose. Your nuclear medicine doctor will suggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get 
rid of the medicine. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass - your doctor will tell 
you what to do. This is normal practice with medicines like Striascan. Any ioflupane (123I) which remains 
in your body will naturally lose its radioactivity. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who 
supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""
