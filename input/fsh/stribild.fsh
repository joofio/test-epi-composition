<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Stribild. </p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Stribild you may still develop 
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Stribild: 
* If you have kidney problems, or have had kidney problems, or if tests have shown problems 
with your kidneys.  Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with Stribild. </p>
<p>Stribild may affect your kidneys.  Before starting treatment, your doctor will order blood tests to 
assess your kidney function.  Your doctor will also order blood tests during treatment to monitor 
your kidneys. </p>
<p>Stribild is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other 
medicines and Stribild).  If this is unavoidable, your doctor will monitor your kidney function 
more frequently. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects).  Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. </p>
<p>Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk in 
adult and paediatric patients are uncertain. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis.  Patients with osteoporosis are at a 
higher risk of fractures. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a 
higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, 
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have hepatitis B infection liver problems may become worse after you stop taking 
Stribild.  It s important not to stop taking Stribild without talking to your doctor: see section 3, 
Do not stop taking Stribild. </p>

<ul>
<li>One tablet each day by mouth, with food.  Do not chew, crush or split the tablet. </li>
</ul>
<p>Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine is

<p>Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle 
with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Stribild </p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of Stribild. </p>
<p>If you do miss a dose: 
* and you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Stribild, you must take the tablet 
as soon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. 
* and you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Stribild, then do not take the 
missed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. </p>
<p>If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Stribild, take another tablet with food. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Stribild </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Stribild without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Stribild can seriously affect 
your response to future treatment.  If Stribild is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before 
you restart taking Stribild tablets. </p>
<p>When your supply of Stribild starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. </p>
<p>If you have HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Stribild 
treatment without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after 
stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not 
recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection (such as yellowing of your skin or 
the white part of your eyes, dark  tea-coloured  urine, light-coloured stools, loss of appetite for 
several days or longer, feeling or being sick, or stomach-area pain). </p>

<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  When 
treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are 
caused by Stribild or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease 
itself. </p>
<p>Possible serious side effects: tell a doctor immediately </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side 
effect of some HIV medicines.  Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women   particularly if 
they are overweight and in people with liver disease.  The following may be signs of lactic 
acidosis:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deep, rapid breathing </p>
</li>
<li>tiredness or drowsiness </li>
<li>feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) </li>
<li>
<p>stomach pain 
  If you think you may have lactic acidosis, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak 
immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon 
after anti-HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement 
in the body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been 
present with no obvious symptoms.  In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune 
disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may 
also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection.<br />
Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment.  If you notice any 
symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the 
hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or 
hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. 
  If you notice any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor immediately. </p>

<p>Very common side effects 
(may affect at least 1 in every 10 patients treated) 
* diarrhoea 
* vomiting 
* feeling sick (nausea) 
* weakness 
* headache, dizziness 
* rash </p>
<p>Tests may also show: 
* decreased phosphate in your blood 
* increased levels of creatine kinase in the blood that may result in muscle pain and weakness </p>
<p>Common side effects 
(may affect 1 to 10 in every 100 patients treated) 
* decreased appetite 
* difficulty sleeping (insomnia), abnormal dreams 
* pain, stomach pain 
* problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) 
* feeling bloated 
* constipation, wind (flatulence) 
* rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), 
which may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin 
in patches 
* other allergic reactions 
* tiredness </p>
<p>Tests may also show: 
* low white blood cell count (which can make you more prone to infection) 
* increased sugar, fatty acids (triglycerides), bilirubin in your blood 
* liver and pancreas problems 
* increased levels of creatinine in your blood </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients treated) 
* suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (in patients who have had depression or mental health 
problems before), depression 
* back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure.  Your doctor may do blood tests 
to see if your kidneys are working properly 
* damage to kidney tubule cells 
* swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat </p>
<ul>
<li>pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) </li>
<li>breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness </li>
</ul>
<p>Tests may also show: 
* anaemia (low red blood cell count) 
* decreased levels of potassium in the blood 
* changes to your urine </p>
<p>Rare side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients treated)

* passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) 
* softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) </p>
<p>The breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may 
occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. </p>
<p>If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Other effects that may be seen during HIV treatment </p>
<p>The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available data). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Stribild 
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, 
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of 
the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>joint stiffness </p>
</li>
<li>joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) </li>
<li>difficulty with movement </li>
</ul>
<p>Other effects in children<br />
<em> Children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour including 
- darkening of the skin in patches<br />
</em> Children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia).<br />
- this may cause the child to be tired or breathless  </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </p>
