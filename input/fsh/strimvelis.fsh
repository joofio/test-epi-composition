<p>Strimvelis is used in children to treat a serious condition called ADA-SCID (adenosine deaminase-severe 
combined immune deficiency). It is used when your child cannot receive a bone marrow transplant from a 
family donor because the match is not close enough. </p>
<p>ADA-SCID occurs because of a faulty gene in the blood cells of your child’s immune system. As a result, 
the cells do not produce enough of an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA) and your child’s immune 
system does not work properly to defend the body against infections.  </p>
<p>To make Strimvelis, stem cells from your child’s bone marrow are modified in the laboratory to insert a gene 
that produces ADA. When these modified stem cells are given back to your child, they can divide to produce 
different types of blood cells, including cells involved in your child’s immune system.  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Strimvelis is not suitable for some people </p>
<p>Strimvelis must not be given if your child: 
- is allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
- has or has had a type of cancer called leukaemia or myelodysplasia 
- has tested positive for HIV or some other infections (your doctor will advise you about this) 
- has already been treated with gene therapy </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Information about cell-based medicinal products, like Strimvelis, must be kept for 30 years at the hospital. 
The information kept about your child will be your child’s name and the batch number of Strimvelis your 
child received. </p>
<p>Strimvelis is made specially from the patient’s own cells. It must never be given to anyone else. </p>
<p>Inserting a new gene into the DNA could cause blood cancer. There has been a case of blood cancer, called 
leukaemia in one patient several years after treatment with Strimvelis. It is therefore important to monitor 
your child for the symptoms of leukaemia.<br />
These include fever, shortness of breath, paleness, night sweats, tiredness, swollen lymph glands, frequent 
infections, a tendency to bleed and/or bruise easily, or tiny red or purple spots under the skin. If your child 
develops any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor immediately.  </p>
<p>Before treatment with Strimvelis, your child will be given other medicines (see sections 3 and 4 for more 
information on these medicines, including possible side effects). </p>
<p>If your child has previously tested positive for hepatitis C, your child can still be treated under certain 
conditions. Your doctor will discuss this with you if needed. </p>
<p>Central venous catheters are thin, flexible tubes, that are inserted by a doctor into a large vein to access the 
bloodstream of your child. The risks of these lines are infections and the formation of blood clots. The doctor 
and nurses will monitor your child for any central venous catheter complications. </p>
<p>Treatment with Strimvelis has been unsuccessful in some patients. These patients received alternative 
treatment options.  </p>
<p>There is a small risk of infection as a result of the treatment. Your child’s doctors and nurses will monitor 
them throughout the infusion for signs of infection and provide treatment if needed. </p>
<p>Some patients can develop autoimmunity i.e. trigger an immune response against their own cells or tissues 
(see section 4). Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you if needed. </p>
<p>After the treatment, your child must not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells at any time in future. This is 
because Strimvelis is a gene therapy product.  </p>
<p>When Strimvelis treatment cannot be completed 
In some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with Strimvelis for reasons 
such as: 
* a problem taking the cells from your child’s bone marrow to make the medicine 
* not enough of the right type of cells in the tissue taken from your child’s body to make the medicine 
* the medicine not meeting all the quality tests<br />
* a delay in the medicine reaching the clinic where your child is being treated. </p>
<p>Before receiving Strimvelis your child will be given chemotherapy in order to remove their existing bone 
marrow. If Strimvelis cannot be administered after chemotherapy or if the modified stem cells do not take 
hold (engraft) in your child’s body, the doctor will give your child replacement stem cells, using the backup 
sample that was collected and stored before treatment started (see also section 3, How Strimvelis is given). </p>
<p>You may need other treatment 
Strimvelis goes through a range of tests before it is used.  Because it is given soon after it is made, the final 
results of some of these tests will not be ready before the medicine is given. If the tests show anything that 
might affect your child, the doctor will treat your child as appropriate. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Strimvelis<br />
Tell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Your child must not be given vaccines called live vaccines for 6 weeks before they are given the 
conditioning medicine to prepare for Strimvelis treatment, nor after treatment while your child’s immune 
system is recovering. </p>
<p>Strimvelis contains sodium 
This medicine contains 42 to 137 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This is 
equivalent to 2 to 7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Before Strimvelis is made, the doctor will do tests to make sure that your child is not carrying certain 
infections (see section 2). </p>
<p>Two samples are collected 
The doctor will collect two samples of bone marrow cells before the planned treatment: 
* the backup sample, collected at least 3 weeks before Strimvelis treatment.  It will be stored, to be 
given as replacement cells if Strimvelis cannot be given or does not work (see ‘When Strimvelis 
treatment cannot be completed’ in section 2)

<p>The side-effects linked to Strimvelis are caused by the immune system becoming over-active and attacking

* raised temperature (pyrexia) 
* underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) 
* high blood pressure (hypertension)<em> 
* decreases in the number of red or white blood cells (anaemia, neutropenia)</em> 
* increases in liver enzymes (which indicate stress on the liver)* 
•    blood test results positive for antinuclear antibody and smooth muscle antibody (which might 
suggest possible autoimmunity) </p>
<p>Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people.<br />
* red or purple dots on the skin, bleeding under the skin (autoimmune thrombocytopenia) 
* inflamed thyroid gland (autoimmune thyroiditis)

* inflamed liver (autoimmune hepatitis) 
* reduced numbers of blood cells (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune aplastic anaemia) 
* blood test results positive for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (which could lead to autoimmune 
inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels and possibly increased level of infections) 
* a type of blood cancer called leukaemia </p>
