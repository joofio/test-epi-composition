<li>
<p>Misuse and abuse<br />
This medicine can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines and should be kept 
in a safe place to protect it from theft (see section 5). Do not give this medicine to anyone else. 
It can cause death or otherwise harm them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathing problems 
Some people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) because they misused 
buprenorphine or have taken it in combination with other central nervous system depressants, 
such as alcohol, benzodiazepines (tranquilisers), or other opioids.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This medicine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression (reduced ability to 
breathe) in children and non-dependent people who accidentally or deliberately take it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sleep-related breathing disorders<br />
Suboxone can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses 
during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can 
include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to 
maintain sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these 
symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependence 
This medicine can cause dependence.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms 
This medicine can cause opioid withdrawal symptoms if you take it too soon after taking 
opioids. You should leave at least 6 hours after you use a short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, 
heroin) or at least 24 hours after you use a long-acting opioid such as methadone. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This medicine can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly. See section 3 
 stopping treatment . </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Liver damage 
Liver damage has been reported after taking Suboxone, especially when the medicine is 
misused. This could also be due to viral infections (e.g. chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, 
anorexia or use of other medicines with the ability to harm your liver (see section 4). Regular 
blood tests may be conducted by your doctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell 
your doctor if you have any liver problems before you start treatment with Suboxone. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood pressure 
This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you 
get up too quickly from sitting or lying down. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions 
This medicine may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases. 
You must tell your doctor that you take this medicine. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 15. If you are between 15 and 18 years old 
your doctor may monitor you more closely during treatment, because of the lack of data in this age 
group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Suboxone 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may increase the side effects of Suboxone, these can be serious. Do not take any 
other medicines whilst taking Suboxone without first talking to your doctor, especially: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, temazepam, 
alprazolam. Concomitant use of Suboxone and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or 
related drugs increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), 
coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be considered 
when other treatment options are not possible. However if your doctor does prescribe Suboxone 
together with sedative medicines the dose and duration of concomitant treatment should be 
limited by your doctor. Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and 
follow your doctor s dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or 
relatives to be aware of the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such as 
anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions/seizures, pain. These types of medicines may reduce your 
alertness levels making it difficult for you to drive and use machines. They may also cause 
central nervous system depression, which is very serious. Below is a list of examples of these 
types of medicines:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other opioid containing medicines such as methadone, certain painkillers and cough 
suppressants </p>
</li>
<li>Antidepressants (used to treat depression) such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, selegiline, 
tranylcypromine and valproate may increase the effects of this medicine. </li>
<li>Sedative H  receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as diphenhydramine and 
chlorphenamine. </li>
<li>Barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital </li>
<li>
<p>Tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, doxepine, or 
trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Suboxone and you may experience symptoms 
such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the muscles, that control 
movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive sweating, tremor, exaggeration of 
reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature above 38 C. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) may extend the effects of this medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>Anti-retrovirals (used to treat HIV) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase the 
effects of this medicine. </li>
<li>Some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
certain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine. </li>
<li>Some medicines may decrease the effect of Suboxone. These include medicines used to treat 
epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin), and medicines used to treat tuberculosis 
(rifampicin). </li>
<li>Naltrexone and nalmefene (medicines used to treat addictive disorders) may prevent the 
therapeutic effects of Suboxone. They should not be taken at the same time as Suboxone 
treatment because you may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense withdrawal. </li>
</ul>
<p>Suboxone with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not have alcohol whilst being treated with this medicine. Alcohol may increase drowsiness and 
may increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with Suboxone. Do not swallow or consume food 
or any drink until the tablet is completely dissolved.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. The risks of using Suboxone in pregnant women 
are not known. Your doctor will decide if your treatment should be continued with an alternative 
medicine. </p>
<p>When taken during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, medicines like Suboxone may cause drug 
withdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. This may appear 
several days after birth. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, as buprenorphine passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, cycle, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how 
this medicine affects you. Suboxone may cause drowsiness, dizziness or impair your thinking. This 
may happen more often in the first few weeks of treatment when your dose is being changed, but it can 
also happen if you drink alcohol or take other sedative medicines at the same time as when you take 
Suboxone. </p>
<p>Suboxone contains lactose and sodium. 
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
