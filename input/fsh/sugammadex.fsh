  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Sugammadex Adroiq is 
Sugammadex Adroiq contains the active substance sugammadex. Sugammadex is considered to be a 
selective relaxant binding agent since it only works with specific muscle relaxants, rocuronium 
bromide or vecuronium bromide. </p>
<p>What Sugammadex Adroiq is used for 
When you have some types of operations, your muscles must be completely relaxed. This makes it 
easier for the surgeon to do the operation. For this, the general anaesthetic you are given includes 
medicines to make your muscles relax. These are called muscle relaxants, and examples include 
rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide. Because these medicines also make your breathing 
muscles relax, you need help to breathe (artificial ventilation) during and after your operation until you 
can breathe on your own again. 
Sugammadex Adroiq is used to speed up the recovery of your muscles after an operation to allow you 
to breathe on your own again earlier. It does this by combining with the rocuronium bromide or 
vecuronium bromide in your body. It can be used in adults whenever rocuronium bromide or 
vecuronium bromide is used and in children and adolescents (aged 2 to 17 years) when rocuronium 
bromide is used for a moderate level of relaxation. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to sugammadex or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
  Tell your anaesthetist if this applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your anaesthetist before Sugammadex Adroiq is given 
* if you have kidney disease or had in the past. This is important as Sugammadex Adroiq is 
removed from your body by the kidneys. 
* if you have liver disease or have had it in the past. </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have fluid retention (oedema). </li>
<li>if you have diseases which are known to give an increased risk of bleeding (disturbances of 
blood clotting) or anticoagulation medicines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for infants less than 2 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sugammadex Adroiq 
  Tell your anaesthetist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Sugammadex Adroiq may affect other medicines or be affected by them. </p>
<p>Some medicines reduce the effect of Sugammadex Adroiq 
 It is especially important that you tell your anaesthetist if you have recently taken: 
* toremifene (used to treat breast cancer). 
* fusidic acid (an antibiotic). </p>
<p>Sugammadex Adroiq can affect hormonal contraceptives 
* Sugammadex Adroiq can make hormonal contraceptives - including the  Pill , vaginal ring, 
implants or a hormonal IntraUterine System (IUS) - less effective because it reduces how much 
you get of the progestogen hormone. The amount of progestogen lost by using Sugammadex 
Adroiq is about the same as missing one oral contraceptive Pill. 
 If you are taking the Pill on the same day as Sugammadex Adroiq is given to you, 
follow the instructions for a missed dose in the Pill s package leaflet. 
 If you are using other hormonal contraceptives (for example a vaginal ring, implant 
or intrauterine system (IUS)) you should use an additional non-hormonal 
contraceptive method (such as a condom) for the next 7 days and follow the advice in 
the package leaflet. </p>
<p>Effects on blood tests 
In general, Sugammadex Adroiq does not have an effect on laboratory tests. However, it may affect 
the results of a blood test for a hormone called progesterone. Talk to your doctor if your progesterone 
levels need to be tested on the same day you receive Sugammadex Adroiq. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
  Tell your anaesthetist if you are pregnant or might be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.<br />
You may still be given Sugammadex Adroiq, but you need to discuss it first. 
It is not known whether sugammadex can pass into breast milk. Your anaesthetist will help you decide 
whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to abstain from sugammadex therapy, considering the 
benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Sugammadex Adroiq to the mother. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Sugammadex Adroiq has no known influence on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Sugammadex Adroiq contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 9.7 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each mL.<br />
This is equivalent to 0.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The dose 
Your anaesthetist will work out the dose of Sugammadex Adroiq you need based on: 
* your weight </p>
<ul>
<li>how much the muscle relaxant medicine is still affecting you. 
The usual dose is 2-4 mg per kg body weight for adults and for children and adolescents between 
2-17 years  old. A dose of 16 mg/kg can be used in adults if urgent recovery from muscle relaxation is 
needed.  </li>
</ul>
<p>How Sugammadex Adroiq is given 
Sugammadex Adroiq will be given to you by your anaesthetist. It is given as a single injection through 
an intravenous line. </p>
<p>If more Sugammadex Adroiq is given to you than recommended 
As your anaesthetist will be monitoring your condition carefully, it is unlikely that you will be given 
too much Sugammadex Adroiq. But even if this happens, it is unlikely to cause any problems.<br />
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your anaesthetist or other doctor. </p>         </div>"""

threatening. 
* Allergic reactions were reported more commonly in healthy, conscious volunteers 
* Return of muscle relaxation after the operation </p>
<p>Frequency not known
