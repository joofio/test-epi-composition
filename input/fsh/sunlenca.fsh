<p>Treatment with Sunlenca in combination with other antiretrovirals reduces the amount of HIV in your

<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines or if you start taking any of these 
medicines during treatment with Sunlenca. Do not stop any treatment without contacting your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Sunlenca is a long-acting medicine. If after talking to your doctor you decide to stop your treatment 
or switch to another, you should know low levels of lenacapavir (the active substance in Sunlenca) can 
remain in your system for many months after your last injection. These low remaining levels should 
not affect other antiretroviral medicines that you take afterwards to treat your HIV infection. Some 
other medicines however may be affected by the low levels of lenacapavir in your system if you take 
them within 9 months after your last Sunlenca injection. You should check with your doctor if such 
medicines are safe for you to take after you stop treatment with Sunlenca. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>As a precautionary measure you should avoid the use of Sunlenca during pregnancy unless your 
doctor tells you otherwise. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby through breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you 
should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Sunlenca is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Sunlenca contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<li>
<p>Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) 
and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune 
system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after 
HIV treatment is started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the 
body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with 
no obvious symptoms.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines for HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>muscle weakness  </p>
</li>
<li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body  </li>
<li>palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity  </li>
