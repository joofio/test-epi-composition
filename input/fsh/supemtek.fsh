<p>How Supemtek works 
When a person is given Supemtek, the body’s natural defence (the immune system) produces 
protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. 
As with all vaccines, Supemtek may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. </p>
<p>When to have a flu vaccine 
Flu can spread very fast.<br />
<em> It is caused by different types of flu virus that can change every year. This is why you might 
need to be vaccinated every year.<br />
</em> The greatest risk of catching flu is during the cold months between October and March.<br />
* If you were not vaccinated in the autumn, it is still sensible to be vaccinated up until the spring 
since you run the risk of catching flu until then.<br />
Your doctor will be able to recommend the best time to be vaccinated. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Supemtek. 
As with all vaccines, Supemtek may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 
Before receiving the vaccine, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if: 
* you have a short-term illness with fever. Vaccination may need to be delayed until your 
fever has gone. 
* you have a weakened immune system (immunodeficiency or you are taking medicines that 
affect the immune system such as cancer medicine (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid 
medicines). 
* you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
* you have fainted with an injection before. Fainting can happen after, or even before an 
injection. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
receiving Supemtek.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Supemtek 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other 
vaccine.<br />
Supemtek may be given at the same time as other vaccines by using separate limbs. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this vaccine. Your doctor or pharmacist will help 
you to decide if you should receive Supemtek. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Supemtek has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machine. </p>
<p>Supemtek contains sodium <br />
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, this means that it’s essentially 
‘sodium free’.  </p>         </div>"""
