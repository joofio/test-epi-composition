effects or stop SUSTIVA from working properly. 
Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before taking SUSTIVA </li>
</ul>
<p>SUSTIVA must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If SUSTIVA 
is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another 
medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time. </p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection, and you may continue to develop infections or other 
illnesses associated with HIV disease.  </p>
<p>You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking SUSTIVA. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol 
abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have 
strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). </li>
<li>if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are 
taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant 
medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking SUSTIVA. Your 
doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. </li>
<li>if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with 
chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher 
risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct 
blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another 
medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take SUSTIVA (see section 2, Do not 
take SUSTIVA). </li>
<li>if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation 
of the QT interval. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start taking SUSTIVA, look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or 
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and 
usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. </li>
<li>any signs of skin rash. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking SUSTIVA and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another 
NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with SUSTIVA. </li>
<li>any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation 
from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed 
that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body s immune response, enabling 
the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you 
notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.<br />
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs 
when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start 
taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may 
occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or 
other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and 
moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please 
inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </li>
<li>bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a 
bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to 
the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be 
some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint 
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
SUSTIVA is not recommended for children under the age of 3 months or weighing less than 3.5 kg 
because it has not been adequately studied in these patients. 
Other medicines and SUSTIVA 
You must not take SUSTIVA with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take 
SUSTIVA, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and an herbal remedy (St. 
John s wort) which can cause serious interactions. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
SUSTIVA may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba
extracts. As a result, the amounts of SUSTIVA or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This 
may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, 
your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines used for HIV infection:</p>
<ul>
<li>protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted 
atazanavir, saquinavir or fosamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you 
an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors. </li>
<li>maraviroc </li>
<li>the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir should not be 
taken with SUSTIVA unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the 
active ingredient of SUSTIVA. </li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, 
elbasvir/grazoprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.</p>
<p>Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related 
mycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider 
changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may 
prescribe a higher dose of SUSTIVA. </p>
<p>Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals):</p>
<ul>
<li>voriconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and 
voriconazole may increase the amount of SUSTIVA in your blood. If you take these two 
medicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of efavirenz 
must be reduced. You must check with your doctor first. </li>
<li>itraconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood. </li>
<li>posaconazole. SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines used to treat parasitic infections: 
praziquantel: SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of praziquantel in your blood. If you take 
these two medications together, your doctor may recommend increasing the dose of 
praziquantel, if needed. </p>
<p>Medicines used to treat malaria:</p>
<ul>
<li>artemether/lumefantrine:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine 
in your blood. </li>
<li>atovaquone/proguanil:  SUSTIVA may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in 
your blood. </li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital. SUSTIVA can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. 
Carbamazepine may make SUSTIVA less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider 
giving you a different anticonvulsant. </p>
<p>Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. 
SUSTIVA can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your 
cholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed. 
 Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an 
alternative treatment. </p>
<p>Metamizole, a medicine used to treat pain and fever</p>
<p>Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of 
sertraline. </p>
<p>Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may 
need to change your dose of bupropion. 
 Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines 
typically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking SUSTIVA, 
your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker. </p>
<p>Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to 
prevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking SUSTIVA, your doctor will 
closely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. </p>
<p>Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for 
example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must 
also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility). 
SUSTIVA may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in 
women taking SUSTIVA while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been 
established that the SUSTIVA therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. </p>
<p>Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): your doctor may 
need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba extracts (an herbal preparation) </p>
<p>Medicines that impact heart rhythm:</p>
<p>Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems: such as flecainide or metoprolol. </p>
<p>Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine </p>
<p>Antibiotics, including the following types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole. 
SUSTIVA with food and drink 
Taking SUSTIVA on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefruit juice should be 
avoided when taking SUSTIVA. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Women should not get pregnant during treatment with SUSTIVA, and for 12 weeks thereafter. 
Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting 
treatment with SUSTIVA.<br />
If you could get pregnant while receiving SUSTIVA, you need to use a reliable form of barrier 
contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or 
other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood 
for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as 
above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking SUSTIVA.<br />
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are 
pregnant, you should take SUSTIVA only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with 
efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during 
pregnancy. If you have taken SUSTIVA or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, 
and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic 
tests to monitor the development of your child. 
You should not breast feed your baby if you are taking SUSTIVA. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible
Driving and using machines 
SUSTIVA contains efavirenz and may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and drowsiness.
If you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines.<br />
SUSTIVA contains lactose in each 600-mg daily dose. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>The dose for adults is 600 mg once daily. </p>
<p>The dose for SUSTIVA may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain 
medicines (see Other medicines and SUSTIVA).  </p>
<p>SUSTIVA is for oral use. SUSTIVA is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach 
preferably at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) 
less troublesome. An empty stomach is commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal.  </p>
<p>It is recommended that the capsule be swallowed whole with water. </p>
<p>SUSTIVA must be taken every day. </p>
<p>SUSTIVA should never be used alone to treat HIV. SUSTIVA must always be taken in 
combination with other anti-HIV medicines. 
Use in children and adolescents </p>
<p>SUSTIVA 50 mg hard capsules can be taken by children and adolescents 3 months of age and 
older and weighing at least 3.5 kg who are able to swallow the capsules. Opening the capsule 
and taking the contents with a small amount of food may be considered for children who cannot 
swallow the hard capsule. </p>
<p>The dose for children and adolescents is calculated by body weight and is taken once daily as 
shown below: 
Body Weight 
SUSTIVA 
Number of Capsules or 
Tablets and Strength to 
Administer 
kg 
Dose (mg) 
3.5 to &lt; 5
one 100 mg capsule
5 to &lt; 7.5
one 100 mg capsule + one 
50 mg capsule 
7.5 to &lt; one 200 mg capsule 
15 to &lt; one 200 mg capsule + one 
50 mg capsule
20 to &lt; three 100 mg capsules
25 to &lt; 32.5 
three 100 mg capsules + 
one 50 mg capsule
32.5 to &lt; two 200 mg capsules
  one 600 mg tablet OR 
three 200 mg capsules
For children who are not able to swallow the capsules, the doctor may recommend opening the hard 
capsule and mixing the contents with a small amount (1-2 teaspoons) of food (e.g., yogurt ). The 
capsules must be opened carefully so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air. Hold the 
capsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule. Use a small 
container for mixing. Give the mixture to the child as soon as possible, but no more than 30 minutes 
after mixing. Make sure the child eats the full amount of the mixture of food and capsule contents. 
Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing container, 
stirring to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container, and have the child eat the full 
amount again. The child should not be given any additional food for 2 hours. The doctor may also 
recommend this method of taking SUSTIVA for adults who cannot swallow capsules. 
Instructions for capsule sprinkle method: 
1
Avoid giving the daily SUSTIVA dose within 1 hour after a feeding or meal.
2
Wash and dry your hands before and after preparing the capsule sprinkle.
3 
Choose a soft food the child likes. Examples of soft foods are applesauce, grape jelly, 
yogurt, or infant formula. In a taste preference study in adults, SUSTIVA mixed with grape 
jelly received the best rating.
4 
Place 1-2 teaspoons of the food in a small container (illustration 
a). 
5 
SUSTIVA capsules must be opened carefully over the food container, as described in 
steps 6-7, so that the contents do not spill.
6 
With your hands over the container, hold the capsule with the cap 
facing up (see illustration b). 
7 
Carefully pull the cap away from the body of the capsule 
(illustration c). 
8 
Sprinkle the contents of the capsule on the food (illustration d). 
9 
If the daily dose consists of more than one capsule, follow steps 5-8 for each capsule. Do not
add more food.
Mix the capsule contents and food together (illustration e). 
Steps 11-14 must be completed within 30 minutes of mixing:
Give the mixture of food and capsule contents to the child, making 
sure he or she eats the full amount (illustration f). 
Add another small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of the food to the empty mixing 
container (illustration a).
Stir to make sure there is no drug residue remaining in the container (illustration e).
Have the child eat the full amount again (illustration f).
Do not give the child any additional food for 2 hours.
If you take more SUSTIVA than you should 
If you take too much SUSTIVA contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. 
Keep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. 
If you forget to take SUSTIVA 
Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your 
medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you stop taking SUSTIVA 
When your SUSTIVA supply starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  </p>         </div>"""

When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are 
caused by SUSTIVA or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease 
itself. 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
The most notable unwanted effects reported with SUSTIVA in combination with other anti-HIV 
medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms. 
You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most 
cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with SUSTIVA. Rash was more 
common in children than in adults treated with SUSTIVA. 
The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in 
the first few weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours 
after taking a dose. If you are affected your doctor may suggest that you take SUSTIVA at bedtime 
and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the 
ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur 
more often in those who have a history of mental illness. Always notify your doctor immediately if 
you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking SUSTIVA.
