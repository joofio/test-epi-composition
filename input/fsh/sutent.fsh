growth and spread of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Sutent is used to treat adults with the following types of cancer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), a type of cancer of the stomach and bowel, where 
imatinib (another anticancer medicine) no longer works or you cannot take imatinib. </li>
<li>Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC), a type of kidney cancer that has spread to other parts 
of the body. </li>

pancreas) that have progressed or cannot be removed with surgery. </li>

<li>If you are allergic to sunitinib or any of the other ingredients of Sutent (listed in section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Sutent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have high blood pressure. Sutent can raise blood pressure. Your doctor may check your 
blood pressure during treatment with Sutent, and you may be treated with medicines to reduce 
the blood pressure, if needed.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had blood disease, bleeding problems, or bruising. Treatment with 
Sutent may lead to a higher risk of bleeding or lead to changes in the number of certain cells in 
the blood which may lead to anaemia or affect the ability of your blood to clot. If you are taking 
warfarin or acenocoumarole, medicines which thin the blood to prevent blood clots, there may 
be a greater risk of bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding while on treatment with 
Sutent.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have heart problems. Sutent can cause heart problems. Tell your doctor if you feel very 
tired, are short of breath, or have swollen feet and ankles.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have abnormal heart rhythm changes. Sutent can cause abnormality of your heart 
rhythm. Your doctor may obtain electrocardiograms to evaluate for these problems during your 
treatment with Sutent. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, faint, or have abnormal heartbeats 
while taking Sutent.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have had a recent problem with blood clots in your veins and/or arteries (types of 
blood vessels), including stroke, heart attack, embolism, or thrombosis. Call your doctor 
immediately if you get symptoms such as chest pain or pressure, pain in your arms, back, neck 
or jaw, shortness of breath, numbness or weakness on 1 side of your body, trouble talking, 
headache, or dizziness while on treatment with Sutent.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had damage to the smallest blood vessels known as thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA). Tell your doctor if you develop fever, fatigue, tiredness, bruising, 
bleeding, swelling, confusion, vision loss, and seizures. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have thyroid glands problems. Sutent can cause thyroid gland problems. Tell your 
doctor if you get tired more easily, generally feel colder than other people, or your voice 
deepens whilst taking Sutent. Your thyroid function should be checked before you take Sutent 
and regularly while you are taking it. If your thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid 
hormone, you may be treated with thyroid hormone replacement.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had pancreatic or gallbladder disorders. Tell your doctor if you develop 
any of the following signs and symptoms: pain in the area of the stomach (upper abdomen), 
nausea, vomiting, and fever. These may be caused by inflammation of the pancreas or 
gallbladder.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had liver problems. Tell your doctor if you develop any of the following 
signs and symptoms of liver problems during Sutent treatment: itching, yellow eyes or skin, dark 
urine, and pain or discomfort in the right upper stomach area. Your doctor should do blood tests 
to check your liver function before and during treatment with Sutent, and as clinically indicated. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had kidney problems. Your doctor will monitor your kidney function.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are going to have surgery or if you had an operation recently. Sutent may affect the 
way your wounds heal. You will usually be taken off Sutent if you are having an operation. 
Your doctor will decide when to start Sutent again. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with Sutent. </p>
</li>
<li>If you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the 
mouth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth, tell your 
doctor and dentist immediately. </li>
<li>
<p>If you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that 
you are being treated with Sutent in particular when you are also receiving or have received 
intravenous bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are medicines used to prevent bone 
complications that may have been given for another medical condition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. While you are on this 
medicine "pyoderma gangrenosum" (painful skin ulceration) or  necrotising fasciitis  (rapidly 
spreading infection of the skin/soft tissue that may be life-threatening) may occur. Contact your 
doctor immediately if symptoms of infection occur around a skin injury, including fever, pain, 
redness, swelling, or drainage of pus or blood. This event is generally reversible after sunitinib 
discontinuation. Severe skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
erythema multiforme) have been reported with the use of sunitinib, appearing initially as reddish 
target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. The rash may 
progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin and may be life-threatening. If you 
develop a rash or these skin symptoms, seek immediate advice from a doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have or have had seizures. Notify your doctor as soon as possible if you have high 
blood pressure, headache, or loss of sight.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have diabetes. Blood sugar levels in diabetic patients should be checked regularly in 
order to assess if antidiabetic medicine s dosage needs to be adjusted to minimise the risk of low 
blood sugar. Notify your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any signs and symptoms 
of low blood sugar (fatigue, palpitations, sweating, hunger and loss of consciousness). </p>
