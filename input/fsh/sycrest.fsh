  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Sycrest contains the active substance asenapine. This medicine belongs to a group of medicines called 
antipsychotics. Sycrest is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar I 
disorder in adults. Antipsychotic medicines affect the chemicals that allow communication between 
nerve cells (neurotransmitters). Illnesses that affect the brain, such as bipolar I disorder, may be due to 
certain chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine and serotonin, being out of balance and these 
imbalances may cause some of the symptoms you may be experiencing. Exactly how this medicine 
works is unknown, however, it is believed to adjust the balance of these chemicals. </p>
<p>Manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder is a condition with symptoms such as feeling “high”, 
having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep than usual, talking very quickly with 
racing ideas and sometimes severe irritability. </p>         </div>"""

If you are allergic to asenapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Sycrest. </p>
<p>Sycrest has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. However, elderly patients with 
dementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke 
or death. Sycrest is not approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia and is not 
recommended for use in this particular group of patients.  </p>
<p>Sycrest may cause low blood pressure. In the early stages of treatment, some people may faint, 
especially when getting up from a lying or sitting position. This will usually pass on its own but if it 
does not, tell your doctor. Your dose may need to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Asenapine may cause sleepiness, sudden drops in blood pressure when you stand up, dizziness and 
changes in your ability to move and balance, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or 
other injuries. Patients at risk for fall should be evaluated prior to prescribing asenapine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you experience 
− 
involuntary rhythmic movements of the tongue, mouth and face. Withdrawal of Sycrest may be 
needed. 
− 
fever, severe muscle stiffness, sweating or a lowered level of consciousness (a disorder called 
“neuroleptic malignant syndrome”). Immediate medical treatment may be needed. </p>
<p>Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sycrest: </p>
<p>− 
if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high body 
temperature and muscle stiffness (also known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome). 
− 
if you have ever experienced abnormal movements of the tongue or face (tardive dyskinesia). 
You should be aware that both of these conditions may be caused by this type of medicine. 
− 
if you have a heart disease or a treatment for heart disease that makes you prone to low blood 
pressure 
− 
if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes 
− 
if you have Parkinson’s disease or dementia 
− 
if you have epilepsy (seizures) 
− 
if you experience any difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) 
− 
if you have severe liver problems. If you do, you should not take Sycrest 
− 
if you have difficulty controlling core body temperature 
− 
if you have thoughts of suicide 
− 
if you have abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood (hyperprolactinaemia) </p>
<p>Be sure to tell your doctor if you meet any of these conditions as he/she may want to adjust your dose 
or monitor you for a while. Also contact your doctor immediately if any of these conditions develops 
or worsens while using Sycrest. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Sycrest is not recommended for use in patients below the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Sycrest 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines may reduce or increase the effect of Sycrest. </p>
<p>If you are taking other medicines, Sycrest should be taken last. </p>
<p>You should tell your doctor if you are taking antidepressant medicines (specifically fluvoxamine, 
paroxetine or fluoxetine), as it may be necessary to change your Sycrest or antidepressant medicine 
dose. </p>
<p>You should tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for Parkinson’s disease (such as levodopa), as 
this medicine may make them less effective. </p>
<p>Since Sycrest works primarily in the brain, interference from other medicines (or alcohol) that work in 
the brain could occur due to an additive effect on brain function. </p>
<p>Since Sycrest can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when Sycrest is taken with other 
medicines that lower blood pressure. </p>
<p>Sycrest with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not eat or drink for 10 minutes after taking this medicine. 
You should avoid drinking alcohol when taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Do not take Sycrest while you are pregnant, unless your doctor tells you so. If you are taking this 
medicine and you become pregnant or you plan to get pregnant, ask your doctor as soon as possible 
whether you may continue taking Sycrest. </p>
<p>The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, of mothers that have used Sycrest in the last 
trimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, 
agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops any of these symptoms 
you may need to contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed when taking Sycrest. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Sycrest may cause sleepiness or sedation. Therefore, make sure your concentration and alertness are 
not affected before you drive or operate machinery. </p>         </div>"""
