  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What SYLVANT is 
SYLVANT is a medicine that contains the active substance siltuximab. 
Siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody (a specialised type of protein) that binds selectively to an antigen 
(a target protein) in the body called interleukin-6 (IL-6). </p>
<p>What SYLVANT is used for 
SYLVANT is used to treat multicentric Castleman s disease (MCD) in adult patients who do not have 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. 
Multicentric Castleman s disease causes benign tumours (non-cancerous growths) to develop in the 
lymph nodes in the body. Symptoms of this disease may include feeling tired, sweating at night, 
having a tingling feeling, and loss of appetite. </p>
<p>How SYLVANT works 
Patients with MCD produce too much IL-6 and this is thought to contribute to the abnormal growth of 
certain cells in lymph nodes. By binding to IL-6, siltuximab blocks its activity and stops abnormal cell 
growth. This helps reduce the size of the affected lymph nodes, which reduces the symptoms of the 
illness and should help you carry out your normal daily tasks. </p>         </div>"""

You are severely allergic to siltuximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given SYLVANT if: 
* you have an infection at the moment   this is because SYLVANT may lower your ability to feel 
or fight infections, and infections may get worse. 
* you are due to have a vaccination or may need to have one in the near future   this is because 
some vaccines should not be given with SYLVANT. 
* you have high level of fats in your blood (hypertriglyceridaemia)   this is because SYLVANT 
may increase these levels. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to correct this. 
* you have a condition such as stomach ulcer or diverticulitis that may increase the risk of getting 
a tear in the stomach or gut (gastrointestinal perforation). Signs of such a tear developing 
include stomach pain getting worse, feeling sick (nausea), change in bowel habits and fever   if 
you get any of these, contact your doctor right away. 
* you have liver disease or changes that show up in blood tests of the liver. Your doctor will 
monitor you and your liver function. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before 
you are given SYLVANT. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
Tell your doctor straight away if you have a severe allergic reaction during or after the infusion. Signs 
include: difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or light-headedness, swelling 
of the lips or skin rash. </p>
<p>Infections 
You may be more likely to get infections while you are being treated with SYLVANT. 
These infections may be serious, such as pneumonia or blood poisoning (also called  sepsis ). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you get any signs of infection during treatment with SYLVANT. 
Signs include: cough, flu-like symptoms, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, fever. Your doctor may stop 
your treatment with SYLVANT straight away. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
It is not known if SYLVANT is safe and effective in this population, therefore SYLVANT should not 
be given to children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and SYLVANT 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.<br />
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
* theophylline, used to treat asthma 
* warfarin, a blood thinner 
* cyclosporin, used during and after organ transplants 
* oral contraceptives, used to prevent pregnancy. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are 
given SYLVANT. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this medicine. 
* SYLVANT is not recommended for use during pregnancy. It is not known if SYLVANT may 
affect the baby or a pregnant or breast-feeding woman. 
* You must not become pregnant while you are being treated with SYLVANT and for 3 months 
after your treatment has finished. You should use effective methods of contraception during this 
time. 
* In some cases, if you are pregnant and need treatment for MCD, your doctor may advise that the 
benefit of taking SYLVANT for your health outweighs the possible risks to your unborn baby, 
including increased risk of infection and use of certain vaccines in babies born to mothers 
exposed to SYLVANT while pregnant. 
* It is not known if. SYLVANT passes into breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you 
will continue to take SYLVANT, or breast-feed and discontinue SYLVANT. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
SYLVANT is not likely to affect your ability to drive, cycle, or use any tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""
