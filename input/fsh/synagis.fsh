dose of Synagis after the operation. Your child can then go back to the original planned injections.
How will my child receive Synagis?
Synagis will be given by injection to your child into a muscle, usually in the outer part of the thigh.
What should you do if your child misses an injection of Synagis?
If your child misses an injection, you should contact your doctor as soon as possible. Each injection of 
Synagis can only help protect your child for about one month before another injection is needed.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. If you are not sure about 
how this product will be given to your child, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
