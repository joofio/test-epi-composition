<p>It is used to help protect your child from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age against: 
a bacteria called  Streptococcus pneumoniae . This bacteria can cause serious illnesses including 
meningitis, sepsis and bacteraemia (bacteria in blood stream) as well as ear infection or pneumonia. </p>
<p>How Synflorix works </p>
<p>Synflorix helps your body to make its own antibodies. The antibodies form a part of the immune

<ul>
<li>your child is allergic to the active substance, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine 
(listed in section 6). 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, being short of breath and swelling of 
the face or tongue. </li>
<li>your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38  C). If this applies to your 
child then the vaccination will be postponed until your child is feeling better. A minor infection 
such as a cold should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor first. </li>
</ul>
<p>Synflorix should not be given if any of the above applies to your child. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Synflorix. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Check with your doctor or pharmacist before this vaccine is given if: 
* your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily. 
In children as of 2 years of age, fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, 
therefore tell the doctor or nurse if your child fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>As with all vaccines, Synflorix may not fully protect all children who are vaccinated.  </p>
<p>Synflorix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria for which the vaccine has been 
developed.  </p>
<p>Children with a weakened immune system (such as due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection or immunosuppressive therapy) may not get the full benefit from Synflorix. </p>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before having Synflorix. </p>
<p>Children above 5 years old </p>
<p>For children above 5 years old safety and efficacy of the vaccine have not been established, therefore 
vaccination of these children is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Synflorix </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, or if they have recently received any other vaccine. Synflorix may not work as well if your 
child is taking medicines that affect the immune system to fight infection. </p>
<p>Synflorix can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as diphtheria, tetanus, 
pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B, 
measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral rotavirus vaccines as well as meningococcal serogroup C and 
serogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugate vaccines. A different place for the injection will be used for 
each vaccine. </p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before 
or immediately after Synflorix is given, especially in children being vaccinated with Synflorix and 
vaccines containing whole cell pertussis at the same time. It is also recommended to administer a 
medicine that lowers fever in children with convulsion disorders or with prior history of febrile 
convulsions. 
However if your child has received paracetamol before or immediately after Synflorix is given, the 
obtained levels of antibodies may be slightly reduced. It is not known whether the reduction in 
antibody levels has an impact on the protection against pneumococcal disease. </p>
<p>Synflorix contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Synflorix is always injected into a muscle. This is usually in the thigh or upper arm. </p>
<p>How much is given </p>
<p>Usually, your child (from 6 weeks to 6 months of age) will receive a course of 4 injections according 
to official recommendations or an alternative schedule may be used by the health care professional. It 
is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse to complete the courses of injections. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each injection will be given at least one month apart except for the last injection (booster), 
which will be given at least 6 months after the third injection. </li>
<li>The first injection may be given from the age of 6 weeks onwards. The last injection (booster) 
may be given from the age of 9 months onwards. </li>
<li>You will be told when your child should come back for the next injections. </li>
</ul>
<p>Preterm infants (born after 27 weeks and less than 37 weeks of pregnancy): 
Your child (from 2 months to 6 months of age) will receive 3 injections with an interval of at least one 
month between each dose. At least six months after the last injection, your child will receive an 
additional injection (booster). </p>
<p>Infants aged 7 to 11 months will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least one month 
apart. A third injection (booster) will be given in the second year of life with at least two months apart. </p>
<p>Children aged 12 months to 5 years will receive 2 injections. Each injection will be given at least two 
months apart. </p>
<p>Special populations: 
Children from 6 weeks up to 5 years of age considered to be at a higher risk of pneumococcal 
infection (such as those with HIV infection, sickle cell disease or impaired or abnormal functioning of 
the spleen) may receive Synflorix. Please speak to your doctor for information on the number and 
timing of injections for your child. </p>
<p>If your child misses an injection </p>
<p>If your child misses an injection, it is important that you make another appointment. This is so that you 
and your doctor can talk about what steps need to be taken to protect your child. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

following side effects may happen with this medicine: </p>
<p>Severe allergic reactions may very rarely occur (with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine). These 
can be recognised by:</p>
<ul>
<li>raised and itchy rash (hives) </li>
<li>swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing </li>
<li>collapse 
These reactions will usually occur before leaving the doctor s surgery. However, if your child gets any 
of these symptoms you should contact a doctor urgently. </li>
</ul>
<p>Very common (these may occur with more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): pain, redness and 
swelling where the injection is given, high temperature of 38  C or higher (fever), feeling sleepy, 
feeling irritable, loss of appetite. </p>
<p>Common (these may occur with up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): hardness where the injection is 
given. </p>
<p>Uncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): itching, blood clot, bleeding 
or a small lump where the injection is given, nausea, diarrhoea or feeling sick (vomiting), unusual 
crying, temporarily stopping breathing (apnoea) if your child is born prematurely (before or at weeks of pregnancy), headache, skin rash, diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving 
the adjacent joint, hives. </p>
<p>Rare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): fits without temperature or due to 
high temperature (fever), allergic reactions such as skin allergies, collapse (sudden onset of muscle 
floppiness), periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness, and paleness or bluish skin 
discoloration. </p>
<p>Very rare ( these may occur with up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine): Kawasaki disease (major 
signs of the illness are for instance: fever, skin rash, swollen lymph glands, inflammation and rash of 
the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat). </p>
<p>Booster doses of Synflorix may increase the risk of side effects. 
For children &gt; 12 months of age, the risk of pain at the injection site may increase with increasing age. </p>
<p>In babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal between 
breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects </p>
<p>If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the
