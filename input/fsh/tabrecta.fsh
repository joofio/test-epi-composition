Tabrecta contains the active substance capmatinib, which belongs to a class of medicines called 
protein kinase inhibitors. </p>
<p>What Tabrecta is used for 
Tabrecta is a medicine used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). It is used if the lung cancer is advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) 
and is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene that makes an enzyme called MET. </p>
<p>Your tumour or blood will be tested for certain mutations in this gene. Your cancer is likely to respond 
to treatment with Tabrecta if the test result is positive. </p>
<p>How Tabrecta works 
Tabrecta helps to slow down or stop the growth and spread of your lung cancer if it is caused by a 
mutation in a gene that makes MET. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Tabrecta works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
