The yellow side of TachoSil contains the active components: fibrinogen and thrombin. The yellow 
side of TachoSil is therefore the active side. When the active side comes into contact with fluids (such 
as blood, lymph or saline solution) the fibrinogen and the thrombin are activated and form a fibrin 
network. This means that the TachoSil sticks to the tissue surface, the blood coagulates (local 
haemostasis) and the tissue is sealed. In the body TachoSil will dissolve and disappear completely. </p>
<p>What is TachoSil used for? 
TachoSil is used during surgery to stop local bleeding (haemostasis) and to seal tissue surfaces on 
internal organs in adults and in children from 1 month of age. 
TachoSil is also indicated in adults in neurosurgery to support sealing of dura mater and prevent 
postoperative cerebrospinal leakage. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to human fibrinogen, human thrombin or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>TachoSil is for local use only and should not be applied inside a blood vessel. Blood clots may occur if 
TachoSil is unintentionally applied inside a blood vessel. </p>
<p>It is possible that you could suffer an allergic reaction after TachoSil has been applied. You may suffer 
hives, or a rash similar to nettle rash, chest discomfort or tightness, wheezing or low blood pressure. 
You should contact your doctor immediately if you discover any of these symptoms. </p>
<p>After abdominal surgery and if TachoSil sticks to nearby tissues, it is possible that scar tissues can 
develop in the operated area. Scar tissues can cause surfaces in your bowel to stick together, which can 
lead to blockage of the bowel. </p>
<p>When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to the patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors 
to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and 
pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the 
processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when 
medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other 
types of infections. </p>
<p>The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The 
measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant woman (foetal infection) and for individuals 
whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia, (e.g., sickle cell disease or 
haemolytic anaemia). </p>
<p>Other medicines and TachoSil 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>TachoSil is made of protein-containing components. The active components are made from human 
blood. All medicines based on human blood may uncommonly cause allergic reactions. In isolated 
cases these allergic reactions may progress to anaphylactic shock. 
These allergic reactions may occur especially if TachoSil is used repeatedly or if you are allergic to 
any of the ingredients in TachoSil. </p>
<p>A clinical study has shown that some patients produced antibodies against the components of 
TachoSil, however, no side effects were reported resulting from the development of these antibodies. </p>
<p>Scar tissues may develop in some patients after surgery and use of TachoSil. Bowel obstruction and 
pain following abdominal surgeries can also occur. Foreign-body granuloma formation has been 
identified as a potential risk. The frequency of these types of events is not known (cannot be estimated 
from available data). Your surgeon will make sure to clean the operating area when applying TachoSil 
to reduce this risk. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
