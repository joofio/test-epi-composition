keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil has been shown to significantly improve the 
ability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity.
Tadalafil Mylan contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Mylan works by helping the 
blood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. Tadalafil Mylan will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction.
It is important to note that tadalafil does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner will 
need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group 
of medicines ( nitrates ) used in the treatment of angina pectoris ( chest pain ). Tadalafil has been 
shown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate or are unsure tell 
your doctor.

pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure

increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your 
doctor.

Tadalafil Mylan and contact your doctor immediately.

prostatic hyperplasia).

your doctor for further information.
Drinking alcohol may temporarily lower your blood pressure. If you have taken or are planning to take 
Tadalafil Mylan, avoid excessive drinking (blood alcohol level of 0.08% or greater), since this may increase 
the risk of dizziness when standing up.
Fertility
When dogs were treated there was reduced sperm development in the testes. A reduction in sperm was seen 
in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility.
Driving and using machines
Some men taking tadalafil in clinical studies have reported dizziness. Check carefully how you react to the 
tablets before driving or using machines.
