or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil Lilly has been shown to significantly 
improve the ability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity. </p>
<p>Tadalafil Lilly contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Lilly works by helping the 
blood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. Tadalafil Lilly will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction.  </p>
<p>It is important to note that Tadalafil Lilly does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your 
partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for 
erectile dysfunction. </p>         </div>"""
