melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. </p>
<p>Tafinlar in combination with trametinib is also used to prevent melanoma from coming back after it 
has been removed by surgery. </p>
<p>Tafinlar in combination with trametinib is also used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). </p>
<p>Both cancers have a particular change (mutation) in a gene called BRAF at the V600 position. This 
mutation in the gene may have caused the cancer to develop. Your medicine targets proteins made 
from this mutated gene and slows down or stops the development of your cancer. </p>         </div>"""

your doctor may recommend that you stop taking Tafinlar, or Tafinlar and trametinib, while they treat 
the fever with other medicines. Once the fever is controlled, your doctor may recommend that you 
start taking Tafinlar again. </p>
<p>Heart conditions 
Tafinlar can affect how well your heart pumps blood when taken in combination with trametinib. It is 
more likely to affect people who have an existing heart problem. You will be checked for any heart 
problems while you are taking Tafinlar in combination with trametinib. Signs and symptoms of heart 
problems include: 
* feeling like your heart is pounding, racing, or beating irregularly 
* dizziness 
* tiredness 
* feeling lightheaded 
* shortness of breath 
* swelling in the legs </p>
<p>Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get any of these symptoms, either for the first time or if 
they get worse. </p>
<p>Changes in your skin 
Serious skin reactions have been reported in people taking Tafinlar in combination with trametinib 
(frequency not known). If you notice any of the following: 
* reddish patches on the trunk that are circular or target-shaped, with central blisters. Skin 
peeling. Ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes. These serious skin rashes can be 
preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
* widespread rash, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes (DRESS-syndrome or drug hypersensitivity 
syndrome). </p>
<p>stop using the medicine and seek medical attention immediately. </p>
<p>Patients taking Tafinlar may commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) develop a different type of 
skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC). Others may develop a type of skin 
cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Usually, these skin changes remain local and can be 
removed with surgery and treatment with Tafinlar can be continued without interruption. </p>
<p>Some people taking Tafinlar may also notice that new melanomas have appeared. These melanomas 
are usually removed by surgery and treatment with Tafinlar can be continued without interruption. </p>
<p>Your doctor will check your skin before you start taking Tafinlar, then check it again every month 
while you are taking this medicine and for 6 months after you stop taking it. This is to look for any 
new skin cancers. </p>
<p>Your doctor will also check your head, your neck, your mouth, your lymph glands and you will have 
scans of your chest and stomach area (called CT scans) regularly. You may also have blood tests. 
These checks are to detect if any other cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, develops inside 
your body. Pelvic examinations (for women) and anal examinations are also recommended before and 
at the end of your treatment. </p>
<p>Check your skin regularly whilst taking Tafinlar 
If you notice any of the following: 
* new wart 
* skin sore or reddish bump that bleeds or does not heal 
* change of a mole in size or colour </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible if you get any of these 
symptoms - either for the first time or if they get worse. </p>
<p>Skin reactions (rash) can happen while taking Tafinlar in combination with trametinib. Talk to your 
doctor if you get a skin rash while taking Tafinlar in combination with trametinib. </p>
<p>Eye problems 
Patients taking Tafinlar alone can uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) develop an eye 
problem called uveitis, which could damage your vision if it is not treated. This may occur commonly 
(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in patients taking Tafinlar in combination with trametinib. </p>
<p>Uveitis may develop rapidly and the symptoms include: 
* eye redness and irritation 
* blurred vision 
* eye pain 
* increased sensitivity to light 
* floating spots before the eyes </p>
<p>Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get these symptoms. </p>

recommended if you have ever had a blockage of the vein draining the eye (retinal vein occlusion). 
Your doctor may advise an eye examination before you take Tafinlar in combination with trametinib

for you to see a specialist eye doctor for a complete eye examination. </p>
<p>Immune system disorders 
If you experience multiple symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph glands, bruising or skin rash, at the 
same time, tell your doctor immediately. It may be a sign of a condition where the immune system 
makes too many infection-fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes that may cause various 
symptoms (called haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), see section 2 (frequency rare). </p>
