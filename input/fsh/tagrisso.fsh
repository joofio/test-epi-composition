  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>TAGRISSO contains the active substance osimertinib, which belongs to a group of medicines called
protein kinase inhibitors which are used to treat cancer. TAGRISSO is used to treat adults with a type of
lung cancer called  non-small cell lung cancer.  If a test has shown that your cancer has certain changes 
(mutations) in a gene called  EGFR  (epidermal growth factor receptor) your cancer is likely to respond to 
treatment with TAGRISSO. TAGRISSO can be prescribed for you:</p>
<p>after complete removal of your cancer as a post-surgical (adjuvant) treatment 
or </p>
<p>as the first medicine you receive for your cancer which has spread to other parts of the body
or</p>
<p>in certain circumstances if you have been treated for your cancer before with other protein kinase 
inhibitor medicines.
How TAGRISSO works
TAGRISSO works by blocking EGFR and may help to slow or stop your lung cancer from growing. It 
may also help to reduce the size of the tumour and prevent the tumour from coming back after removal by 
surgery.</p>
<p>If you are receiving TAGRISSO after complete removal of your cancer, it means that your cancer 
contained defects in the EGFR gene,  exon 19 deletion  or  exon 21 substitution mutation .</p>
<p>If TAGRISSO is the first protein kinase inhibitor medicine you are receiving, it means that your 
cancer contains defects in the EGFR gene, for example  exon 19 deletion  or  exon 21 substitution 
mutation .  </p>
<p>If your cancer has progressed while you were being treated with other protein kinase inhibitor 
medicines, it means that your cancer contains a gene defect called  T790M . Because of this defect, 
other protein kinase medicines may no longer work.
If you have any questions about how this medicine works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor.</p>         </div>"""
