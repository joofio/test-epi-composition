What TAKHZYRO is used for<br />
TAKHZYRO 150 mg is a medicine used in patients 2 years of age and older weighing less than 40 kg, 
to prevent angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE).<br />
What hereditary angioedema (HAE) is<br />
HAE is a condition which runs in families. With this condition the patients blood does not have 
enough of a protein called  C1 inhibitor , or C1 inhibitor does not work properly. This leads to too 
much  plasma kallikrein , which in turn produces higher levels of  bradykinin  in the bloodstream. 
Too much bradykinin leads to symptoms of HAE like swelling and pain on the, </p>
<p>hands and feet  </p>
<p>face, eyelids, lips or tongue  </p>
<p>voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult  </p>
<p>genitals<br />
How TAKHZYRO works<br />
TAKHZYRO is a type of protein that blocks the activity of plasma kallikrein. This helps to reduce the 
amount of bradykinin in the bloodstream and prevents symptoms of HAE.<br />
2. What you need to know before giving TAKHZYRO<br />
Do not use TAKHZYRO<br />
If your child or the child you are caring for is allergic to lanadelumab or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6).<br />
Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to the child s doctor, pharmacist or nurse before giving TAKHZYRO.  </p>
<p>If the child has a severe allergic reaction to TAKHZYRO with symptoms such as a rash, a tight 
chest, wheezing, or a fast heartbeat, tell the child s doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. 
Keeping a record<br />
It is strongly recommended that every time your child or the child you are caring for has a dose of 
TAKHZYRO, you write down the name and batch number of the medicine. This is so that you keep a 
record of the batches used.<br />
Laboratory tests<br />
Tell the child s doctor if they are using TAKHZYRO before they have laboratory tests to measure how 
well their blood is clotting. This is because TAKHZYRO in the blood may interfere with some 
laboratory tests, leading to inaccurate results. 
Children<br />
TAKHZYRO is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age. This is because it has not 
been studied in this age group.<br />
Other medicines and TAKHZYRO<br />
Tell the child s doctor or pharmacist if the child is taking, or has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.<br />
TAKHZYRO is not known to affect other medicines or be affected by other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If the child is pregnant or breast-feeding, think they may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask their doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting to use TAKHZYRO. There is limited 
information on the safety of TAKHZYRO use during pregnancy and breast-feeding. As a 
precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lanadelumab during pregnancy and breast-
feeding. Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.<br />
Driving and using machines<br />
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.<br />
TAKHZYRO contains sodium<br />
The medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
