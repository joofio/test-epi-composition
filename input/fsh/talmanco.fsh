helping the blood vessels around your lungs relax, improving the flow of blood into your lungs. The

breast milk. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding. </p>

seen in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. </p>

Dizziness has been reported. Check carefully how you react to the medicines before driving or using 
any machinery. </p>

has also been reported. </li>

<p>Some side effects have been reported in men taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. 
These events were not seen in clinical studies for pulmonary arterial hypertension and therefore

</ul>
<p>Most but not all of those men reporting fast heart rate, irregular heartbeat, heart attack, stroke and 
sudden cardiac death had known heart problems before taking tadalafil. It is not possible to determine 
whether these events were related directly to tadalafil. </p>
