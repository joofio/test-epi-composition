helping the blood vessels around your lungs relax, improving the flow of blood into your lungs. The

high blood pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., 
high blood pressure in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Talmanco, 
have been shown to increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat 
or are unsure tell your doctor. </li>
</ul>

breast milk. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding. </p>

seen in some men. These effects are unlikely to lead to a lack of fertility. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness has been reported. Check carefully how you react to the medicines before driving or using 
any machinery. </p>
<p>Talmanco contains lactose and sodium </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.

has also been reported. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some side effects have been reported in men taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

</ul>

sudden cardiac death had known heart problems before taking tadalafil. It is not possible to determine 
whether these events were related directly to tadalafil. </p>
