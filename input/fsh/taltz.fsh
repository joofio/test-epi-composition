<p>Taltz is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: 
* Plaque psoriasis in adults 
* Plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in 
adolescents 
* Psoriatic arthritis in adults 
* Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis in adults 
* Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis in adults </p>
<p>Ixekizumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine 
works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which promotes psoriasis and 
inflammatory disease of the joints and the spine. </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis 
Taltz is used to treat a skin condition called  plaque psoriasis  in adults and in children from the age 
of 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents with moderate to severe 
disease. Taltz reduces the signs and symptoms of the disease.  </p>
<p>Using Taltz will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms 
such as scaling, itching and pain. </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis<br />
Taltz is used to treat a condition called  psoriatic arthritis  in adults, an inflammatory disease of the 
joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines or in case of intolerance, you will be 
given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease. Taltz can be used alone or with another 
medicine named methotrexate. </p>
<p>Using Taltz will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the disease, improving physical 
function (ability to do normal daily activities), and slowing down the damage to the joints. </p>
<p>Axial spondyloarthritis 
Taltz is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which causes 
inflammation of the spinal joints, called axial spondyloarthritis. If the condition is visible using 
X-rays, it is referred to as  radiographic axial spondyloarthritis ; if it occurs in patients with no visible 
signs on X-rays, it is referred to as  non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis . If you have axial 
spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce 
inflammation and improve your physical function. </p>         </div>"""
