blood sugar level.  </p>
<p>It is used in adults when metformin is not suitable to treat type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes 
mellitus. This type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood where the body either does not produce 
enough insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels), or cannot effectively use the insulin it 
produces. </p>
<p>Tandemact helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by increasing 
the amount of insulin available and helping your body make better use of it. Your doctor will check 
whether Tandemact is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Tandemact 
- if you are allergic to pioglitazone, glimepiride, other sulphonylureas or sulphonamides, or any 
of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
- if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past 
- if you have liver disease 
- if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with rapid weight loss, nausea or 
vomiting) 
- if you have severe problems with your kidneys 
- if you have or have ever had bladder cancer 
- if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked 
- if you have insulin dependent diabetes (type 1) 
- if you are in a diabetic coma 
- if you are pregnant 
- if you are breast-feeding </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tandemact (see also section 4) 
- if you have a problem with your heart. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin 
together experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if 
you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in 
weight or localised swelling (oedema).<br />
- if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems in particular if you are over 
75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and 
swelling, you must also tell your doctor. 
- if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back 
of the eye), talk to your doctor if you notice any change to your vision.<br />
- if you have a problem with your liver. Before you start taking Tandemact you will have a blood 
sample taken to check your liver function. This check should be repeated at intervals. Inform 
your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms suggesting a problem with your liver 
(like feeling sick without explanations, vomiting, stomach ache, tiredness, loss of appetite 
and/or dark urine) as your liver function should be checked.<br />
- if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased 
possibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Tandemact. If 
this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned 
pregnancy. 
- if you are already taking other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. 
- if you have problems with your enzyme called Glucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase since it can 
decrease your red cells. </p>
<p>You may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia). Your doctor may take blood tests to 
monitor your blood cell levels and liver function. </p>
<p>Hypoglycaemia 
When you take Tandemact, your blood sugar could fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia). If 
you experience symptoms of hypoglycaemia such as cold sweat, tiredness, headache, rapid heartbeat, 
hunger pangs, irritability, nervousness or nausea, you should take some sugar to increase your blood 
sugar level again. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information if you are not sure how to 
recognise this. It is recommended that you carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit 
juice. </p>
<p>Broken bones 
A higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your 
doctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tandemact 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because some medicines can weaken or strengthen the effect of Tandemact on the 
level of sugar in your blood. </p>
<p>The following medicines can increase the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact. This can lead to 
a risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar):</p>
<ul>
<li>gemfibrozil and fibrates (to lower high cholesterol level) </li>
<li>insulin, metformin or other medicines to treat diabetes mellitus  </li>
<li>phenylbutazone, azapropazone, oxyphenbutazone, aspirin-like medicines (to treat pain and 
inflammation) </li>
<li>long acting sulphonamides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, fluconazole, miconazole, 
quinolones, clarithromycin (to treat bacterial or fungal infections) </li>
<li>anabolic steroids (supporting muscle build up) or male sex hormone replacement therapy  </li>
<li>fluoxetine, MAO-inhibitors (to treat depression) </li>
<li>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, sympatholytics, disopyramide, pentoxifylline, 
coumarin derivatives such as warfarin (to treat heart or blood problems) </li>
<li>allopurinol, probenecid, sulfinpyrazone (to treat gout) </li>
<li>cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, trofosfamide (to treat cancer) </li>
<li>fenfluramine (to reduce weight) </li>
<li>tritoqualine (to treat allergies) </li>
</ul>
<p>The following medicines may decrease the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact. This can lead to 
a risk of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar level):</p>
<ul>
<li>oestrogens, progestogens (female sex hormones) </li>
<li>thiazide diuretics and saluretics also called water tablets (to treat high blood pressure) </li>
<li>levothyroxine (to stimulate the thyroid gland) </li>
<li>glucocorticoids (to treat allergies and inflammation)  </li>
<li>chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine derivatives (to treat severe mental disorders) </li>
<li>adrenaline and sympathicomimetics (to increase heart beat, to treat asthma or nasal congestion, 
coughs and colds or used in life-threatening emergencies)  </li>
<li>nicotinic acid (to treat high cholesterol level)  </li>
<li>long-term use of laxatives (to treat constipation) </li>
<li>phenytoin (to treat fits) </li>
<li>barbiturates (to treat nervousness and sleep problems) </li>
<li>azetazolamide (to treat increased pressure in the eye also called glaucoma) </li>
<li>diazoxide (to treat high blood pressure or low blood sugar) </li>
<li>rifampicin (to treat infections, tuberculosis) </li>
<li>glucagon (to treat severe low blood sugar levels) </li>
</ul>
<p>The following medicines can increase or decrease the blood sugar lowering effect of Tandemact:</p>
<ul>
<li>H2 antagonists (to treat stomach ulcers) </li>
<li>beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine (to treat high blood pressure or heart 
failure). These can also hide the signs of hypoglycaemia, so special care is needed when taking 
these medicines  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tandemact may either increase or weaken the effects of the following medicines:</p>
<ul>
<li>coumarin derivatives such as warfarin (to slow down or stop blood clotting)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and 
your dose of Tandemact may need to be changed. </p>
<p>Tandemact with alcohol 
Avoid alcohol while taking Tandemact since alcohol may increase or decrease the blood sugar 
lowering action of Tandemact in an unpredictable way. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Tandemact if you are pregnant. You must tell your doctor if you are, you think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. 
Do not use Tandemact if you are breastfeeding or are planning to breast-feed (see section  Do not take 
Tandemact ). </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Alertness and reaction time may be impaired due to low or high blood sugar due to glimepiride, 
especially when beginning or after altering treatment, or when Tandemact is not taken regularly. This 
may affect your ability to drive or use machines.<br />
Take care if you experience abnormal vision. </p>
<p>Tandemact contains lactose monohydrate 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking Tandemact.<br />
Tandemact contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
