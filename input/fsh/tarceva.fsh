preventing the activity of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This protein is 
known to be involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Tarceva is indicated for adults. This medicine can be prescribed to you if you have non-small cell lung 
cancer at an advanced stage. It can be prescribed as initial therapy or as therapy if your disease 
remains largely unchanged after initial chemotherapy, provided your cancer cells have specific EGFR 
mutations. It can also be prescribed if previous chemotherapy has not helped to stop your disease. </p>
<p>This medicine can also be prescribed to you in combination with another treatment called gemcitabine 
if you have cancer of the pancreas at a metastatic stage. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to erlotinib or any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions: 
* if you are taking other medicines that may increase or decrease the amount of erlotinib in your 
blood or influence its effect (for example antifungals like ketoconazole, protease inhibitors, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, 
ciprofloxacin, omeprazole, ranitidine, St. John s Wort or proteasome inhibitors), talk to your 
doctor. In some cases these medicines may reduce the efficacy or increase the side effects of 
Tarceva and your doctor may need to adjust your treatment. Your doctor might avoid treating 
you with these medicines while you are receiving Tarceva. 
* if you are taking anticoagulants (a medicine which helps to prevent thrombosis or blood clotting 
e.g. warfarin), Tarceva may increase your tendency to bleed. Talk to your doctor, he will need 
to regularly monitor you with some blood tests. 
* if you are taking statins (medicines to lower your blood cholesterol), Tarceva may increase the 
risk of statin related muscle problems, which on rare occasions can lead to serious muscle 
breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) resulting in kidney damage, talk to your doctor. 
* if you use contact lenses and/or have a history of eye problems such as severe dry eyes, 
inflammation of the front part of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the front part of the eye, 
tell your doctor. </p>
<p>See also below  Other medicines and Tarceva  </p>
<p>You should tell your doctor: 
* if you have sudden difficulty in breathing associated with cough or fever because your doctor 
may need to treat you with other medicines and interrupt your Tarceva treatment; 
* if you have diarrhoea because your doctor may need to treat you with anti-diarrhoeal (for 
example loperamide); 
* immediately, if you have severe or persistent diarrhoea, nausea, loss of appetite, or vomiting 
because your doctor may need to interrupt your Tarceva treatment and may need to treat you in 
the hospital; 
* if you have ever had problems with your liver. Tarceva may cause serious liver problems and 
some cases have been fatal. Your doctor may perform blood tests while you are taking this 
medicine to monitor whether your liver functions properly; 
* if you have severe pain in the abdomen, severe blistering or peeling of skin. Your doctor may 
need to interrupt or stop your treatment; 
* if you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred 
vision and/or sensitivity to light, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately as you may need 
urgent treatment (see Possible Side Effects below). 
* if you are also taking a statin and experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or 
cramps. Your doctor may need to interrupt or stop your treatment. </p>
<p>See also section 4  Possible side effects . </p>
<p>Liver or kidney disease

normally. The treatment with this medicine is not recommended if you have a severe liver disease or 
severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>Glucuronidation disorder like Gilbert s syndrome 
Your doctor must treat you with caution if you have a glucuronidation disorder like Gilbert s 
syndrome. </p>
