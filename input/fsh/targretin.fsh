<p>if you are allergic to bexarotene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).
-
if you are pregnant or breast feeding or if you can become pregnant and are not using effective 
birth control measures.
-
if you have a history of pancreatitis, have uncontrolled lipid (blood fats) elevations (high blood 
cholesterol or high blood triglycerides), have a condition known as hypervitaminosis A, have 
uncontrolled thyroid disease, have insufficient liver function or have an ongoing systemic 
infection.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Targretin
-
if you have a known hypersensitivity to retinoids (related to vitamin A), suffer from liver 
disease, have high blood lipids or take medicines which may cause high blood lipids, have 
uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), have had gall bladder or biliary tract disease, or 
consume excessive amounts of alcohol.
-
if you have ever had any mental health problems including depression, aggressive tendencies or 
mood changes. This is because taking Targretin may affect your mood.
Your fasting blood lipid determinations may have to be performed before therapy is initiated and at 
weekly intervals afterwards, and then monthly while taking this medicine.
Blood tests to evaluate the function of your liver and thyroid gland and to monitor your red blood cell 
and white blood cell counts will be obtained before therapy is started and will be monitored during 
therapy.
Periodic eye exams may be needed if you experience visual difficulties while taking this medicine.
Minimise exposure to sunlight as much as possible and avoid exposure to sun lamps. 
Do not take more than 15,000 International Units of vitamin A supplements per day during treatment.
Mental health problems
You may not notice some changes in your mood and behaviour and so it is very important that you tell 
your friends and family that this medicine could affect your mood and behaviour. They may notice 
these changes and help you identify any problems that you need to talk to your doctor about.
Children and adolescents
Targretin capsules should not be used in children or adolescents.
Other medicines and Targretin
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, such as</p>
<p>ketoconazole and itraconazole (used against fungal infections),</p>
<p>erythromycin, clarithromycin and rifampicin (used against bacterial infections),</p>
<p>phenytoin and phenobarbital (used against seizures),</p>
<p>gemfibrozil (used to reduce high levels of fats in the blood such as triglycerides and 
cholesterol),</p>
<p>vitamin A supplements, protease inhibitors (used against viral infections),</p>
<p>tamoxifen (used against some forms of cancer),</p>
<p>dexamethasone (used for inflammatory conditions),</p>
<p>insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion, or insulin-sensitisers (used against diabetes 
mellitus).
This is important as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or weaken the 
effect of the medicines.
Targretin with food and drink
Targretin should be taken with food (see section 3). If you regularly consume grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice, please consult your doctor as these have the potential to alter your body s response to Targretin 
therapy.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Targretin may be harmful to a developing foetus.  DO NOT use Targretin if you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to 
have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
If you are capable of becoming pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test within one week before you 
start therapy, confirming you are not pregnant. You must use effective contraception (birth control) 
continuously starting one month before beginning therapy until one month after you stop taking 
Targretin. It is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used together. If you are 
taking a hormonal contraceptive (for example, birth control pills), you should discuss this with your 
doctor.
If you are male and your partner is pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant, you must use condoms 
during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose.
Driving and using machines
It is not known whether Targretin has an effect on your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. If 
you experience dizziness or problems with your vision during therapy, do not drive or operate 
machinery.
Targretin contains sorbitol and butylated hydroxyanisole
Targretin contains a small amount of sorbitol (a type of sugar). If you have an intolerance to some 
sugars, speak to your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
Butylated hydroxyanisole may cause irritation to the mucous membranes, therefore the capsules must 
be swallowed intact and not chewed.</p>         </div>"""
