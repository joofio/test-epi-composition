Tasigna is a medicine containing an active substance called nilotinib. </p>
<p>What Tasigna is used for 
Tasigna is used to treat a type of leukaemia called Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (Ph-positive CML). CML is a cancer of the blood which makes the body produce too many 
abnormal white blood cells. </p>
<p>Tasigna is used in adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML or in patients with CML 
who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment including imatinib. It is also used in adult and 
paediatric patients who experienced serious side effects with previous treatment and are not able to 
continue taking it. </p>
<p>How Tasigna works 
In patients with CML, a change in DNA (genetic material) triggers a signal that tells the body to 
produce abnormal white blood cells. Tasigna blocks this signal, and thus stops the production of these 
cells. </p>
<p>Monitoring during Tasigna treatment 
Regular tests, including blood tests, will be performed during treatment. These tests will monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in the body to see 
how Tasigna is tolerated. </li>
<li>pancreas and liver function in the body to see how Tasigna is tolerated. </li>
<li>the electrolytes in the body (potassium, magnesium). These are important in the functioning of 
the heart. </li>
<li>the level of sugar and fats in the blood. 
The heart rate will also be checked using a machine that measures electrical activity of the heart (a test 
called an  ECG ). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will regularly evaluate your treatment and decide whether you should continue to take 
Tasigna. If you are told to discontinue this medicine, your doctor will continue to monitor your CML 
and may tell you to re-start Tasigna if your condition indicates that this is necessary. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how Tasigna works or why it has been prescribed for you or your 
child, ask your doctor. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Do not take Tasigna 
- if you are allergic to nilotinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, tell your doctor before taking Tasigna. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have suffered prior cardiovascular events such as a heart attack, chest pain (angina), 
problems with the blood supply to your brain (stroke) or problems with the blood flow to your 
leg (claudication) or if you have risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood 
pressure (hypertension), diabetes or problems with the level of fats in your blood (lipid 
disorders). </li>
<li>if you have a heart disorder, such as an abnormal electrical signal called  prolongation of the 
QT interval . </li>
<li>if you are being treated with medicines that lower your blood cholesterol (statins), or affect the 
heartbeat (anti-arrhythmics) or the liver (see Other medicines and Tasigna). </li>
<li>if you suffer from lack of potassium or magnesium. </li>
<li>if you have a liver or pancreas disorder. </li>
<li>if you have symptoms such as easy bruising, feeling tired or short of breath or have experienced 
repeated infections. </li>
<li>if you have had a surgical procedure involving the removal of the entire stomach (total 
gastrectomy). </li>
<li>if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Tasigna could 
cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be 
carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. 
If any of these apply to you or your child, tell your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>During treatment with Tasigna 
- if you faint (loss of consciousness) or have an irregular heart beat while taking this medicine, 
tell your doctor immediately as this may be a sign of a serious heart condition. Prolongation of 
the QT interval or an irregular heart beat may lead to sudden death. Uncommon cases of sudden 
death have been reported in patients taking Tasigna. 
- if you have sudden heart palpitations, severe muscle weakness or paralysis, seizures or sudden 
changes in your thinking or level of alertness, tell your doctor immediately as this may be a 
sign of a fast breakdown of cancer cells called tumour lysis syndrome. Rare cases of tumour 
lysis syndrome have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. 
- if you develop chest pain or discomfort, numbness or weakness, problems with walking or with 
your speech, pain, discolouration or a cool feeling in a limb, tell your doctor immediately as 
this may be a sign of a cardiovascular event. Serious cardiovascular events including problems 
with the blood flow to the leg (peripheral arterial occlusive disease), ischaemic heart disease and 
problems with the blood supply to the brain (ischaemic cerebrovascular disease) have been 
reported in patients taking Tasigna. Your doctor should assess the level of fats (lipids) and sugar 
in your blood before initiating treatment with Tasigna and during treatment. 
- if you develop swelling of the feet or hands, generalised swelling or rapid weight gain tell your 
doctor as these may be signs of severe fluid retention. Uncommon cases of severe fluid 
retention have been reported in patients treated with Tasigna. 
If you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Tasigna, tell the doctor if any of the above 
conditions apply to your child. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Tasigna is a treatment for children and adolescents with CML. There is no experience with the use of 
this medicine in children below 2 years of age. There is no experience with the use of Tasigna in 
newly diagnosed children below 10 years of age and limited experience in patients below 6 years of 
age who are no longer benefiting from previous treatment for CML. </p>
<p>Some children and adolescents taking Tasigna may have slower than normal growth. The doctor will 
monitor growth at regular visits. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tasigna 
Tasigna may interfere with some other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>anti-arrhythmics   used to treat irregular heart beat; </li>
<li>chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin - medicines 
that may have an unwanted effect on the electrical activity of the heart; </li>
<li>ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin   used to treat 
infections; </li>
<li>ritonavir   a medicine from the class   antiproteases  used to treat HIV; </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin   used to treat epilepsy; </li>
<li>rifampicin   used to treat tuberculosis; </li>
<li>St. John s Wort   a herbal product used to treat depression and other conditions (also known as 
Hypericum perforatum); </li>
<li>midazolam   used to relieve anxiety before surgery; </li>
<li>alfentanil and fentanyl   used to treat pain and as a sedative before or during surgery or medical 
procedures; </li>
<li>cyclosporine, sirolimus and tacrolimus   medicines that suppress the  self-defence  ability of 
the body and fight infections and are commonly used to prevent the rejection of transplanted 
organs such as the liver, heart and kidney; </li>
<li>dihydroergotamine and ergotamine   used to treat dementia; </li>
<li>lovastatin, simvastatin   used to treat high level of fats in blood; </li>
<li>warfarin   used to treat blood coagulation disorders (such as blood clots or thromboses); </li>
<li>astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, 
dihydroergotamine). 
These medicines should be avoided during your treatment with Tasigna. If you are taking any of these, 
your doctor might prescribe other alternative medicines. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are taking a statin (a type of medicine to lower your blood cholesterol), talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. If used with certain statins, Tasigna may increase the risk of statin-related muscle 
problems, which on rare occasions can lead to serious muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) resulting 
in kidney damage. </p>
<p>In addition, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasigna if you are taking any antacids, which 
are medicines against heartburn. These medicines need to be taken separately from Tasigna:</p>
<ul>
<li>H2 blockers, which decrease the production of acid in the stomach. H2 blockers should be taken 
approximately 10 hours before and approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna; </li>
<li>antacids such as those containing aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and simethicone, 
which neutralise high acidity in the stomach. These antacids should be taken approximately 
2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after you take Tasigna. </li>
</ul>
<p>You should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Tasigna and you are prescribed a new 
medicine that you have not taken previously during Tasigna treatment. </p>
<p>Tasigna with food and drink 
Do not take Tasigna with food. Food may enhance the absorption of Tasigna and therefore increase 
the amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat 
grapefruit. It may increase the amount of Tasigna in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- Tasigna is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant 
or think that you may be, tell your doctor who will discuss with you whether you can take this 
medicine during your pregnancy. 
- Women who might get pregnant are advised to use highly effective contraception during 
treatment and for up to two weeks after ending treatment. 
- Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Tasigna and for two weeks after the 
last dose. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you experience side effects (such as dizziness or visual disorders) with a potential impact on the 
ability to safely drive or use any tools or machines after taking this medicine, you should refrain from 
these activities until the effect has disappeared. </p>
<p>Tasigna contains lactose 
This medicine contains lactose (also known as milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that 
you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

200 mg twice a day. </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
- The dose given to your child will depend on your child s body weight and height. The doctor 
will calculate the correct dose to use and tell you which and how many capsules of Tasigna to 
give to your child. The total daily dose you give to your child must not exceed 800 mg. </p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose depending on how you respond to treatment. </p>
<p>Older people (age 65 years and over) 
Tasigna can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. </p>
<p>When to take Tasigna 
Take the hard capsules:</p>
<ul>
<li>twice a day (approximately every 12 hours); </li>
<li>at least 2 hours after any food; </li>
<li>then wait 1 hour before eating again. 
If you have questions about when to take this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Taking 
Tasigna at the same time each day will help you remember when to take your hard capsules. </li>
</ul>
<p>How to take Tasigna 
- Swallow the hard capsules whole with water. 
- Do not take any food together with the hard capsules. 
- Do not open the hard capsules unless you are unable to swallow them. If so, you may sprinkle 
the content of each hard capsule in one teaspoon of apple sauce and take it immediately. Do not 
use more than one teaspoon of apple sauce for each hard capsule and do not use any food other 
than apple sauce. </p>
<p>How long to take Tasigna 
Continue taking Tasigna every day for as long as your doctor tells you. This is a long-term treatment. 
Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired 
effect. 
Your doctor may consider discontinuing your treatment with Tasigna based on specific criteria. 
If you have questions about how long to take Tasigna, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>If you take more Tasigna than you should 
If you have taken more Tasigna than you should have, or if someone else accidentally takes your hard 
capsules, contact a doctor or hospital for advice straight away. Show them the pack of hard capsules 
and this package leaflet. Medical treatment may be necessary. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Tasigna 
If you miss a dose, take your next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten hard capsule. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Tasigna 
Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to do so. Stopping Tasigna without your 
doctor s recommendation places you at risk for worsening of your disease which could have 
life-threatening consequences. Be sure to discuss with your doctor, nurse, and/or pharmacist if you are 
considering stopping Tasigna. </p>
<p>If your doctor recommends that you discontinue treatment with Tasigna 
Your doctor will regularly evaluate your treatment with a specific diagnostic test and decide whether 
you should continue to take this medicine. If you are told to discontinue Tasigna, your doctor will 
continue to carefully monitor your CML before, during and after you have discontinued Tasigna and 
may tell you to re-start Tasigna if your condition indicates that this is necessary. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
