Tasmar is used when all other alternative medicines cannot stabilise your Parkinson s disease.  </p>
<p>For the treatment of your Parkinson s disease you already take levodopa. 
A natural protein (enzyme) in your body, the (COMT) Catechol-O-methyltransferase breaks down the 
levodopa. Tasmar blocks this enzyme and thus slows the breakdown of levodopa. This means when it 
is taken together with levodopa (as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa) you should have an

<li>if you take a certain medication to treat depression and anxiety, called non-selective mono 
amino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors  </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasmar. 
You should not start taking Tasmar until your doctor 
- has described the risks of treatment with Tasmar 
- has explained the measures necessary to minimise those risks 
- has answered any questions you may have 
- if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits 
of taking Tasmar during pregnancy. The effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You 
should not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Tasmar. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in 
ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain 
activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and 
can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a 
preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your 
treatments. </p>
<p>You should only receive Tasmar if your Parkinson s disease is not adequately controlled by the use of<br />
other therapies. </p>
<p>In addition, your doctor will stop Tasmar treatment if after 3 weeks you do not improve enough to 
justify the risks of continuing treatment. </p>
<p>Liver Injury 
Tasmar may cause rare but potentially fatal liver injury. Liver injury has occurred most often after 1 
month and before 6 months. It should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver 
injury. Therefore, the following preventive measures have to be considered. </p>
<p>Before beginning treatment:<br />
To reduce the risk of liver injury you should not use Tasmar if<br />
- you have a liver disease<br />
- in case of elevated liver function tests in the blood test done before starting treatment (tests 
of alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST)).  </p>
<p>While receiving treatment: 
During treatment, blood tests will be done in the following time intervals:</p>
<ul>
<li>every 2 weeks during the first 12 months of therapy, </li>
<li>every 4 weeks during the following 6 months of therapy, </li>
<li>every 8 weeks during further treatment. 
The treatment will be stopped, if these blood tests become abnormal.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The treatment with Tasmar may sometimes lead to disturbances in the way the liver works. Therefore, 
you should contact your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, 
pain in your stomach (particularly over the liver in the right upper area), loss of appetite, weakness, 
fever, darkening of urine, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) or if you tire more easily. 
If you have been already treated with Tasmar and developed acute liver injury during treatment, 
Tasmar should not be re-introduced again. </p>
<p>NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome)<br />
Symptoms of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur during Tasmar treatment. 
The NMS consists of some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>severe muscle stiffness, jerking movements of muscles, arms or legs, and soreness of muscles. 
Muscle injury can sometimes cause dark urine. </li>
<li>other important symptoms are high fever and mental confusion. </li>
</ul>
<p>Rarely, after abruptly reducing or stopping Tasmar or other antiparkinsonian drugs, you may 
experience severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental confusion. If this happens notify 
your doctor. </p>
<p>The following preventive measures have to be considered. </p>
<p>Before beginning treatment: 
To reduce the risk of NMS you should not use Tasmar if your doctor says you have severe involuntary 
movement (dyskinesia) or a previous illness that may have been NMS. 
Inform your doctor about all prescription and non-prescription medications as the risk of NMS may be 
increased if you are taking some specific medications. </p>
<p>While receiving treatment: 
If you develop any symptoms as described above, that you think may be NMS, you should report them 
to your doctor immediately.<br />
Do not stop Tasmar or any other Parkinson s medications without telling your doctor as this may 
increase the risk of NMS. </p>
<p>Inform your doctor also:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have any illnesses other than Parkinson s disease </li>
<li>if you are allergic to other medicines, food and dyes </li>
<li>if soon after beginning and during treatment with Tasmar you have symptoms which may be 
caused by levodopa such as involuntary movement (dyskinesia) and nausea. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel unwell, you should contact your doctor because you may need to take less levodopa. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Tasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety 
or efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other Medicines and Tasmar 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
even those not prescribed (non-prescription medicines and herbals). </p>
<p>Please inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking especially:</p>
<ul>
<li>antidepressants </li>
<li>alpha-methyldopa (used to treat increased blood pressure) </li>
<li>apomorphine (used for Parkinson s disease) </li>
<li>dobutamine (used for the chronic heart disease) </li>
<li>adrenaline and isoprenaline (both used for heart attacks) </li>
<li>anticoagulants of the warfarin type (that prevent blood clotting). In this case your doctor may 
perform regular blood tests to monitor how easily your blood clots. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you go to hospital or if you are prescribed a new medicine, you must tell your doctor that you are 
taking Tasmar. </p>
<p>Tasmar with food and drink and alcohol 
Tasmar can be taken with or without food. 
Tasmar should be taken with 1 glass of water. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility 
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss 
the risks and benefits of taking Tasmar during pregnancy. </p>
<p>The effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You should not breast-feed your infant during 
treatment with Tasmar. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Since your ability to drive a car or operate machinery may be affected by Parkinson s disease, you 
should discuss this with your doctor. </p>
<p>Tasmar has an effect on the symptoms of your Parkinson s disease. 
Tasmar used with your other Parkinson medicines can cause excessive drowsiness (somnolence) and 
sudden sleep onset episodes (you may suddenly fall asleep). Therefore you must refrain from driving 
or operating machines until such recurrent episodes and excessive drowsiness have resolved.  </p>
<p>Tasmar contains lactose and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>Dose and frequency of administration 
Your doctor should always begin your treatment with the standard dose of 3 times daily 1 tablet 
(100 mg (1 tablet)). 
If benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment, Tasmar should be 
discontinued. 
To improve efficacy your doctor should only increase the dose to 3 times daily 2 tablets (200 mg three 
times a day) if the increase in how your Parkinson s disease symptoms are controlled outweighs the 
expected increase in side effects. The side effects at the higher dose can often be severe and affect 
your liver. If you do not get better at the higher dose after a total of 3 weeks, your doctor should stop 
your treatment with Tasmar.  </p>
<p>When beginning and during treatment with Tasmar, your dose of levodopa may need to be changed. 
Your doctor will advise you what to do. </p>
<p>How to take the medication: 
Swallow Tasmar with 1 glass of water. 
Do not break or crush the tablets. 
The first tablet Tasmar is to be taken in the morning together with your other parkinsonian medicine 
 levodopa . 
The following doses of Tasmar should be taken 6 and 12 hours later. </p>

she may need urgent medical attention. </p>
<p>Symptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and breathing difficulties.  </p>
<p>If you forget to take Tasmar 
Take it as soon as you remember, then continue to take it at the usual times. However, if taking the 
next dose should be directly ahead, do not make up for the forgotten dose. Do not take a double dose 
to make up for forgotten individual doses. If you have forgotten several doses, please inform your 
doctor and follow the advice given to you. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Tasmar 
Do not reduce or stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Always follow the
