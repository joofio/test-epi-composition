<p>if the number of white blood cells is too low. </p>
<p>if you have a severe liver disease. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before each treatment with TAXOTERE, you will have blood tests to check that you have enough 
blood cells and sufficient liver function to receive TAXOTERE. In case of white blood cells 
disturbances, you may experience associated fever or infections. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, hospital pharmacist, or nurse immediately if you have abdominal pain or tenderness, 
diarrhoea, rectal haemorrhage, blood in stool or fever. These symptoms may be the first signs of a 
serious gastrointestinal toxicity, which could be fatal. Your doctor should address them immediately. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, hospital pharmacist or nurse if you have vision problems. In case of vision 
problems, in particular blurred vision, you should immediately have your eyes and vision examined.  </p>

paclitaxel therapy. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, hospital pharmacist or nurse if you have heart problems.  </p>
<p>If you develop acute or worsening problems with your lungs (fever, shortness of breath or cough), 
please tell your doctor, hospital pharmacist or nurse immediately. Your doctor may stop your 
treatment immediately. </p>
<p>You will be asked to take premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid such as dexamethasone, 
one day prior to TAXOTERE administration and to continue for one or two days after it in order to 
minimise certain undesirable effects which may occur after the infusion of TAXOTERE in particular 
allergic reactions and fluid retention (swelling of the hands, feet, legs or weight gain). </p>
<p>During treatment, you may be given other medicines to maintain the number of your blood cells. </p>
<p>Severe skin problems such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), 
Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with TAXOTERE:</p>
<ul>
<li>SJS/TEN symptoms may include blistering, peeling or bleeding on any part of your skin 
(including your lips, eyes, mouth, nose, genitals, hands or feet) with or without a rash. You 
may also have flu-like symptoms at the same time, such as fever, chills or aching muscles. </li>
<li>AGEP symptoms may include a red, scaly widespread rash with bumps under the swollen skin 
(including your skin folds, trunk, and upper extremities) and blisters accompanied by fever.<br />
If you develop severe skin reactions or any of the reactions listed above, immediately contact your 
doctor or healthcare professional. </li>
</ul>

in your blood before intiating TAXOTERE. </p>

epilepsy or liver impairment. See also section   TAXOTERE contains ethanol (alcohol)  below. </p>
<p>Other medicines and TAXOTERE </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicine, including medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because TAXOTERE or the 
other medicine may not work as well as expected and you may be more likely to get a side effect.<br />
The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice before being given any medicine. </p>

<p>You must not become pregnant during treatment and for 2 months after end of treatment with this 
medicine. You must use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 2 months after 
end of treatment, because TAXOTERE may be harmful for the unborn baby. If pregnancy occurs 
during your treatment, you must immediately inform your doctor. </p>
<p>You must not breast-feed while you are treated with TAXOTERE. </p>
<p>If you are a man being treated with TAXOTERE you must not father a child and must use an effective 
method of contraception during treatment and for 4 months after end of treatment with this medicine.

alter male fertility. </p>
