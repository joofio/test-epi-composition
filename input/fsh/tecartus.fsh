  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tecartus is a gene therapy medicine used for treating mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia in adults. It is used when other medicines have stopped working for you 
(relapsed or refractory disease). The medicine is made specially for you from your own white blood 
cells that have been modified and is known as brexucabtagene autoleucel. </p>
<p>Mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are cancers of a part of the immune 
system (the body s defences). They affect a type of white blood cell called B-lymphocytes. In both 
mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, B-lymphocytes grow in an 
uncontrolled way and build up in the lymph tissue, bone marrow or blood. </p>
<p>How Tecartus works </p>
<p>The white blood cells are taken from your blood and are genetically modified so that they can target 
the cancer cells in your body. When Tecartus is infused into your blood, the modified white blood 
cells will kill the cancer cells. </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you 
may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>if you can t receive the medicine to reduce the number of white blood cells in your blood 
(lymphodepleting chemotherapy) (see also section 3, How Tecartus is given). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Tecartus is made from your own white blood cells and must only be given to you (autologous use).  </p>
<p>Tests and checks </p>
<p>Before you are given Tecartus your doctor will: 
* Check your lungs, heart, kidney and blood pressure. 
* Look for signs of infection or inflammation; and decide whether you need to be treated before 
you are given Tecartus. 
* Check if your cancer is getting worse. 
* Look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. This happens 
when transplanted cells attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea and bloody stools. 
* Check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. This will 
show if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome. You may be given 
medicines to help prevent the condition. 
* Check for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection. 
* Check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next 
few months. 
* Check if you have previously received a treatment that attaches to the protein called CD19. In some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with Tecartus. If 
Tecartus infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy you may have to receive more chemotherapy (see also section 3, How Tecartus is 
given). </p>
<p>After you have been given Tecartus </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse immediately or get emergency help right away if you have any of the 
following: 
* Chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, rapid or 
irregular heartbeat, severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea which may be symptoms of a 
condition known as cytokine release syndrome. Take your temperature twice a day for 3 to 
4 weeks after treatment with Tecartus. If your temperature is high, see your doctor immediately. 
* Fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level 
of consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. 
* Fever (e.g. temperature above 38 C), which may be a symptom of an infection. 
* Extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red 
blood cells. 
* Bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood 
known as platelets. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood 
components may decrease. </p>
<p>You will be asked to enrol in a registry for at least 15 years in order to better understand the long-term 
effects of Tecartus.  </p>
<p>Do not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplants. 
Children,adolescents and young adults </p>
<p>Tecartus must not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age or young adults below 
26 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tecartus </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Before you are given Tecartus tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken 
your immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of 
Tecartus. </p>
<p>In particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: 
* In the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of lymphodepleting chemotherapy to 
prepare your body for the Tecartus cells. 
* During Tecartus treatment. 
* After treatment while the immune system is recovering. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. This is because the effects of Tecartus in 
pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your 
breast-fed child. 
* If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Tecartus, talk to your 
doctor immediately. 
* You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Tecartus can only be given if the 
results show you are not pregnant. </p>
<p>Discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Tecartus. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Tecartus can cause problems such as altered or decreased consciousness, confusion and seizures (fits) 
in the 8 weeks after it is given. </p>
<p>Do not drive, use machines, or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 8 weeks after 
your Tecartus treatment or until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered. </p>
<p>Tecartus contains sodium, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and gentamicin </p>
<p>This medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion bag. 
This is equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. It 
also contains DMSO and gentamicin which may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>Since Tecartus is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you 
to prepare your medicine. Your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in 
your vein (a procedure call leukapheresis). Some of your white blood cells are separated from 
your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. This can take 3 to 6 hours and 
may need to be repeated. </li>
<li>Your white blood cells are sent away to a manufacturing center to make your Tecartus. It 
usually takes about 2 to 3 weeks to make Tecartus but the time may vary. </li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines given before Tecartus treatment </p>
<p>A few days before you receive Tecartus, you will be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which will 
allow the modified white blood cells in Tecartus to multiply in your body when the medicine is given 
to you. </p>
<p>During the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Tecartus you may be given other medicines. This is 
to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. These other medicines may include: 
* Paracetamol. 
* An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. </p>
<p>How you are given Tecartus </p>
<p>Tecartus will always be given to you by a doctor in a qualified treatment centre. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tecartus is given in a single dose. </li>
<li>Your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of Tecartus through a catheter placed into 
your vein (intravenous infusion) over about 30 minutes. </li>
<li>Tecartus is the genetically modified version of your white blood cells. Your healthcare 
professional handling the treatment will therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves 
and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases and will follow local 
guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material to clean up or dispose of any 
material that has been in contact with it. </li>
</ul>
<p>After you are given Tecartus </p>
<ul>
<li>You must stay close to the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after Tecartus 
treatment. Your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital daily for at least 10 days 
or that you stay at the hospital as an in-patient for the first 10 days after Tecartus treatment. This 
is so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and help you if you have any side 
effects. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you miss any appointments, call your doctor or your treatment centre as soon as possible to 
reschedule your appointment. </p>         </div>"""
