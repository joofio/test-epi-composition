<p>Tecfidera is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. </p>
<p>What Tecfidera is used for </p>
<p>Tecfidera is used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients aged 13 years 
and older.  </p>
<p>MS is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and the 
spinal cord. Relapsing-remitting MS is characterised by repeated attacks (relapses) of nervous system 
symptoms. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, but typically include walking difficulties, feeling 
off balance and visual difficulties (e.g. blurred or double vision). These symptoms may disappear 
completely when the relapse is over, but some problems may remain. </p>
<p>How Tecfidera works </p>
<p>Tecfidera seems to work by stopping the body’s defence system from damaging your brain and spinal 
cord. This may also help to delay future worsening of your MS.  </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to dimethyl fumarate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6). </li>
<li>if you are suspected to suffer from a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) or if PML has been confirmed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Tecfidera may affect your white blood cell counts, your kidneys and liver. Before you start 
Tecfidera, your doctor will do a blood test to count the number of your white blood cells and will 
check that your kidneys and liver are working properly. Your doctor will test these periodically during 
treatment. If your number of white blood cells decreases during treatment, your doctor may consider 
additional tests or discontinue your treatment. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Tecfidera if you have: 
- severe kidney disease 
- severe liver disease 
- a disease of the stomach or bowel 
- a serious infection (such as pneumonia) </p>
<p>Herpes zoster (shingles) may occur with Tecfidera treatment. In some cases, serious complications 
have occurred. You should inform your doctor immediately if you suspect you have any symptoms 
of shingles. </p>
<p>If you believe your MS is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you notice any new 
symptoms, talk to your doctor straight away because these may be the symptoms of a rare brain 
infection called PML. PML is a serious condition that may lead to severe disability or death. </p>
<p>A rare but serious kidney disorder called Fanconi syndrome has been reported with a medicine 
containing dimethyl fumarate, in combination with other fumaric acid esters, used to treat psoriasis (a 
skin disease). If you notice you are passing more urine, are thirstier and drinking more than normal, 
your muscles seem weaker, you break a bone, or just have aches and pains, talk to your doctor as soon 
as possible so that this can be investigated further. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children below 10 years of age because no data are available in this age 
group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tecfidera </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, in particular:<br />
- medicines that contain fumaric acid esters (fumarates) used to treat psoriasis; 
- medicines that affect the body’s immune system including chemotherapy, 
immunosuppressants, or other medicines used to treat MS; 
- medicines that affect the kidneys including some antibiotics (used to treat infections), “water 
tablets” (diuretics), certain types of painkillers (such as ibuprofen and other similar anti-
inflammatories and medicines purchased without a doctor’s prescription) and medicines that 
contain lithium;<br />
- taking Tecfidera with certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) may cause you to get an infection 
and should, therefore, be avoided. Your doctor will advise whether other types of vaccines (non-
live vaccines) should be given.  </p>
<p>Tecfidera with alcohol </p>
<p>Consumption of more than a small amount (more than 50 ml) of strong alcoholic drinks (more than 
30% alcohol by volume, e.g. spirits) should be avoided within an hour of taking Tecfidera, as alcohol 
can interact with this medicine. This could cause inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), especially in 
people already prone to gastritis. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>There is limited information about the effects of this medicine on the unborn child if used during 
pregnancy. Do not use Tecfidera if you are pregnant unless you have discussed this with your doctor 
and this medicine is clearly necessary for you. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>It is not known whether the active substance of Tecfidera passes into breast milk. Your doctor will 
advise whether you should stop breast-feeding, or stop using Tecfidera. This involves balancing the 
benefit of breast-feeding for your child, and the benefit of therapy for you. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Tecfidera is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Tecfidera contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free’. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>Serious side effects </p>
<p>Tecfidera may lower lymphocyte counts (a type of white blood cell). Having a low white blood cell 
count can increase your risk of infection, including the risk of a rare brain infection called progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML may lead to severe disability or death. PML has 
occurred after 1 to 5 years of treatment and so your physician should continue to monitor your white 
blood cells throughout your treatment, and you should remain observant of any potential symptoms of 
PML as described below. The risk of PML may be higher if you have previously taken a medicine 
impairing the functionality of your body’s immune system. </p>
<p>The symptoms of PML may be similar to an MS relapse. Symptoms may include new or worsening 
weakness on one side of the body; clumsiness; changes in vision, thinking, or memory; or confusion or 
personality changes, or speech and communication difficulties lasting for more than several days. 
Therefore, if you believe your MS is getting worse or if you notice any new symptoms while you are 
on Tecfidera treatment, it is very important that you speak to your doctor as soon as possible. Also 
speak with your partner or caregivers and inform them about your treatment. Symptoms might arise 
that you might not become aware of by yourself. </p>
<p>→ 
Call your doctor straight away if you experience any of these symptoms  </p>
<p>Severe allergic reactions </p>
<p>The frequency of severe allergic reactions cannot be estimated from the available data (not known).  </p>
<p>Reddening of the face or body (flushing) is a very common side effect. However, should flushing be 
accompanied by a red rash or hives and you get any of these symptoms: </p>
<ul>
<li>swelling of the face, lips, mouth or tongue (angioedema) </li>
<li>wheezing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (dyspnoea, hypoxia) </li>
<li>dizziness or loss of consciousness (hypotension) </li>
</ul>
<p>then this may represent a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). </p>
<p>→ 
Stop taking Tecfidera and call a doctor straight away </p>
<p>Other side effects </p>
<p>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
- reddening of the face or body feeling warm, hot, burning or itchy (flushing) 
- loose stools (diarrhoea) 
- feeling sick (nausea)<br />
- stomach pain or stomach cramps </p>
<p>→ 
Taking your medicine with food can help to reduce the side effects above </p>
<p>Substances called ketones, which are naturally produced in the body, very commonly show up in urine 
tests while taking Tecfidera. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about how to manage these side effects. Your doctor may reduce your dose. Do 
not reduce your dose unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
- inflammation of the lining of the intestines (gastroenteritis) 
- being sick (vomiting) 
- indigestion (dyspepsia) 
- inflammation of the lining of the stomach (gastritis) 
- gastrointestinal disorder 
- burning sensation 
- hot flush, feeling hot 
- itchy skin (pruritus) 
- rash 
- pink or red blotches on the skin (erythema) 
- hair loss (alopecia) </p>
<p>Side effects which may show up in your blood or urine tests 
- low levels of white blood cells (lymphopenia, leucopenia) in the blood. Reduced white blood 
cells could mean your body is less able to fight an infection. If you have a serious infection 
(such as pneumonia), talk to your doctor immediately 
- proteins (albumin) in urine 
- increase in levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST) in the blood </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) 
- reduction in blood platelets </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
- liver inflammation and increase in levels of liver enzymes (ALT or AST in combination with 
bilirubin) 
- herpes zoster (shingles) with symptoms such as blisters, burning, itching or pain of the skin, 
typically on one side of the upper body or the face, and other symptoms, like fever and 
weakness in the early stages of infection, followed by numbness, itching or red patches with 
severe pain 
- runny nose (rhinorrhoea) </p>
<p>Children (13 years of age and above) and adolescents 
The side effects listed above also apply to children and adolescents.<br />
Some side effects were reported more frequently in children and adolescents than in adults, e.g, 
headache, stomach pain or stomach cramps, being sick (vomiting), throat pain, cough, and painful 
menstrual periods. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of
