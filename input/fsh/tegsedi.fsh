transthyretin amyloidosis. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is a genetic disease, which causes 
build-up of small fibres of a protein called transthyretin in the organs of your body stopping them from 
working properly. Tegsedi is used when the disease is causing symptoms of polyneuropathy (nerve 
damage). </p>
<p>Inotersen, is a type of medicine called an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor. It works by reducing 
production of transthyretin by the liver and so lowers the risk of fibres of transthyretin being deposited 
in body organs and causing symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Tegsedi if: 
- You are allergic to inotersen or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
- Tests show you have excessively low numbers of platelets, the cells in your blood which stick 
together helping it clot. 
- Tests of kidney function or protein in the urine show signs of severe kidney problems. 
- You have severe reduction in liver function (hepatic impairment). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Before you begin treatment with Tegsedi, your doctor will measure your blood cells, liver function, 
kidney function, vitamin A and protein levels in your urine. You may also be tested to assure a 
negative pregnancy result.  Unless explicitly advised by your doctor, you will only be treated with 
Tegsedi if these results are all at acceptable levels and your pregnancy result is negative.  Your doctor 
will repeat these checks regularly during treatment. It is important that you have these regular blood 
and urine tests for as long as you are taking Tegsedi. </p>
<p>Thrombocytopenia </p>
<p>Tegsedi may reduce cells in the blood responsible for clotting of the blood (platelets), which may 
result in a condition called thrombocytopenia at any time during treatment with Tegsedi (see section 
4). When you do not have enough platelets, like in thrombocytopenia, your blood may not clot quickly 
enough to stop bleeding. This can lead to bruising as well as other more serious problems such as 
excessive bleeding and internal bleeding. Your doctor will check your blood for levels of platelets 
before treatment and regularly during the entire course of treatment with Tegsedi. It is important that 
you have these regular blood tests for as long as you are taking Tegsedi because of the risk of serious 
bleeding caused by low platelet counts. If you stop taking Tegsedi, your blood levels should be 
checked 8 weeks after discontinuation.  </p>
<p>You should see your doctor immediately if you have unexplained bruising or a rash of small patches 
of red appearing on the skin (called petechiae), bleeding from skin cuts that does not stop or oozes, 
bleeding from the gums or nose, blood in urine or stools, bleeding in the whites of your eyes. Call for 
immediate help if you have stiffness of the neck or an unusual and severe headache because these 
symptoms may be caused by bleeding in the brain.  </p>
<p>Glomerulonephritis / kidney problems </p>
<p>Glomerulonephritis is a condition of your kidneys, where they do not work properly due to 
inflammation and kidney damage. Some patients treated with inotersen have developed this condition. 
Symptoms of glomerulonephritis are foaming urine, pink or brown coloured urine, blood in the urine, 
and passing less urine than usual. </p>
<p>Some patients treated with inotersen have also developed a decline in their kidney function without 
having had glomerulonephritis. </p>
<p>Your doctor will check your kidney function before treatment and regularly during treatment with 
Tegsedi. It is important that you have these regular blood tests for as long as you are taking Tegsedi 
because of the risk of kidney problems. If you stop taking Tegsedi then your kidney function should be 
checked 8 weeks after discontinuation. If you develop glomerulonephritis, your doctor will treat you 
for this condition.  </p>
<p>Vitamin A deficiency </p>
<p>Tegsedi can lower your body’s levels of vitamin A (also called retinol). Your doctor will measure 
these, and if they are already low, this should be corrected and any symptoms resolved before you start 
treatment with Tegsedi. Symptoms of low vitamin A include: 
* Dry eyes, poor vision, decrease in night vision, hazy or cloudy vision  </p>
<p>If you have problems with your sight or any other eye problems when you are using Tegsedi, you 
should speak to your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist for a check-up if it is 
necessary. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you to take a daily vitamin A supplement during treatment with Tegsedi.  </p>
<p>Both excess and deficient levels of vitamin A can harm the development of your unborn child. 
Therefore, women of child-bearing age should exclude any pregnancy, before treatment initiation with 
Tegsedi and should practise effective contraception (see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding” 
below). </p>
<p>If you are planning to become pregnant you should stop taking inotersen including vitamin A 
supplementation and ensure that your vitamin A levels have returned to normal before conception is 
attempted.  </p>
<p>If you have an unplanned pregnancy you should stop taking inotersen. Due to the prolonged activity of 
Tegsedi, however, your reduced vitamin A levels may persist. It is unknown if continuation of your 
vitamin A supplementation with 3 000 IU per day will be harmful to your unborn child in the first 
trimester of your pregnancy, but this dose should not be exceeded. You should resume the vitamin A 
supplementation during your second and third trimesters of your pregnancy if your vitamin A levels 
have not yet returned to normal, because of the increased risk of vitamin A deficiency in the third 
trimester. </p>
<p>Liver injury and monitoring </p>
<p>Tegsedi may cause serious liver problems. You will need a blood test before you start taking inotersen 
to check whether your liver is working properly. You will also need these blood tests regularly while 
you are taking this medicine. It is important that you have these regular blood tests for as long as you 
are taking Tegsedi.  </p>
<p>Liver transplant rejection </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Tegsedi if you have previously received a liver transplant. Cases of 
liver transplant rejection have been reported in patients being treated with Tegsedi. Your doctor will 
monitor you regularly for this during treatment with Tegsedi.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Tegsedi should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years old.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tegsedi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might use any other medicines. 
It is important that you tell your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the following: 
- Medicines to prevent blood clots or that lower the platelet numbers in your blood, e.g., 
acetylsalicylic acid, heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel, rivoraxaban and dabigatran. 
- Any medicines that may alter your kidney function or may damage the kidneys, e.g., 
sulfonamides (used as an antibacterial), anilides (used to treat fever, aches and pains), 
aldosterone antagonists (used as a diuretic) and natural opium alkaloids and other opioids (used 
for treatment of pain).  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.  </p>
<p>Women of child-bearing age </p>
<p>Tegsedi will reduce the level of vitamin A in your body, which is important for normal foetal 
development during pregnancy. It is unknown if vitamin A supplementation can compensate for the 
risk of vitamin A deficiency that might affect your unborn child (see “Warnings and precautions” 
above). If you are a woman of child-bearing age, you should practise effective contraception and any 
pregnancy should be excluded before starting the treatment with Tegsedi. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>You should not use Tegsedi if you are pregnant, unless explicitly advised by your doctor </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Inotersen may pass into breast milk. A risk to the breastfed infant cannot be excluded. You should 
consult your doctor if you should either stop breast-feeding or stop the treatment with Tegsedi.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Use of Tegsedi has not been shown to affect ability to drive or use machinery. </p>
<p>Tegsedi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1.5 mL, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’ </p>         </div>"""
