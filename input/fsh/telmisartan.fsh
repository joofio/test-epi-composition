  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Telmisartan Teva Pharma belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin II is a substance occurring in the body, which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus 
increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan Teva Pharma blocks this effect of angiotensin II so that the 
blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. </p>
<p>Telmisartan Teva Pharma is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults.  Essential<br />
means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. </p>
<p>High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs,  which could lead sometimes 
to heart attacks, heart or kidney failure, strokes or blindness. There are usually no symptoms of high blood 
pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is 
within the normal range. </p>
<p>Telmisartan Teva Pharma is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults 
who are at risk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke 
or have high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).<br />
- if you are more than 3 months pregnant (It is also better to avoid Telmisartan Teva Pharma in early 
pregnancy   see pregnancy section). 
- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease. <br />
- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering 
medicine containing aliskiren. </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telmisartan Teva 
Pharma. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or 
illnesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kidney disease or kidney transplant </li>
<li>Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys) </li>
<li>Liver disease </li>
<li>Heart trouble </li>
<li>Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood 
minerals) </li>
<li>Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body water) 
or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ( water tablets ), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or vomiting. </li>
<li>Elevated potassium levels in your blood </li>
<li>Diabetes </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva Pharma:</p>
<h2>- if you are taking digoxin.</h2>

<ul>
<li>an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-
related kidney problems. </li>
<li>aliskiren. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) 
in your blood at regular intervals. </p>
<p>See also information under the heading  Do not take Telmisartan Teva Pharma . </p>
<p>You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Telmisartan Teva Pharma is 
not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). </p>

Telmisartan Teva Pharma  and  Warnings and precautions ).
