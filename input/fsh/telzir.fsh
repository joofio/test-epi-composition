<p>Telzir is a type of medicine known as an anti-retroviral.  It is taken with low doses of another 
medicine, ritonavir, which boosts the level of Telzir in the blood. Telzir belongs to a group of 
anti-retroviral medicines called protease inhibitors.  Protease is an enzyme produced by HIV which 
enables the virus to multiply in white blood cells (CD4 cells) in your blood.  By stopping protease 
from working, Telzir stops HIV multiplying and infecting more CD4 cells.    </p>
<p>Telzir with low doses of ritonavir is used in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines 
( combination therapy ) to treat adults, adolescents and children aged over 6 years infected with<br />
HIV.     </p>
<p>HIV can become resistant to anti-HIV medicines.  To avoid this happening, and to stop your illness 
getting worse, it is very important that you keep taking all your medicines exactly as prescribed.  </p>
<p>Telzir will not stop you passing on HIV.  HIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone 
who s got the infection, or by transfer of infected blood (for example by sharing needles).  </p>         </div>"""

<p>Take special care with Telzir 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telzir:<br />
<em> If you have a known allergy to medicines containing sulphonamide.  You may also be allergic 
to Telzir. 
* If you have liver disease.  Your doctor may lower your dose of Telzir and ritonavir depending on 
the amount of liver damage. You will be monitored while you are taking Telzir. If your liver 
disease gets worse, you may need to stop taking Telzir for a while, or permanently. People with 
hepatitis B or C taking combination therapy are at increased risk of getting severe liver problems.  <br />
</em> If you have haemophilia. Increased bleeding may occur while taking protease inhibitors (such as 
Telzir). The reason for this is not known. You may need additional factor VIII to control any 
bleeding. 
* If you have diabetes. In some patients taking antiretroviral medicines including protease 
inhibitors, there have been reports of increased sugar in the blood and diabetes getting worse. 
Also, some people have become diabetic while taking these medicines. 
* If you are taking any other medicines.  See section  Other medicines and Telzir . </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  You will need extra check-ups, including blood 
tests, while you re taking your medication.   </p>
<p>Your doctor will monitor your blood glucose levels before and during treatment with Telzir. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious.<br />
These include: 
* Flare up of old infections 
* Change in your body shape 
* Problems with your bones. 
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you re taking Telzir. 
Please read the information on  Other side effects of combination therapy for HIV  in section 4 
of this leaflet.  If you have any questions about this information or the advice given: 
 Talk to your doctor.  </p>
<p>You may get a skin rash.  However you can still continue to take Telzir. It can be treated with 
antihistamines. Rarely, the skin rash can be severe and serious (Stevens Johnson syndrome). If this 
happens, Telzir must be stopped immediately and you must never take it again.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Telzir<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you re taking or have recently taken any other medicines <br />
these include herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription. Your doctor will 
decide if these medicines are suitable for you to take with Telzir and ritonavir. This is very 
important, as Telzir or ritonavir can strengthen or weaken the effects of other medicines.  This can 
sometimes lead to serious medical conditions.  </p>
<p>There are some medicines that must not be taken with Telzir. You must check the list of medicines 
under 'Don't take Telzir' at the beginning of section 2 of this leaflet.  </p>

<p>Hormonal contraception

contraceptive from working properly. 
  Use an alternative non-hormonal type of contraception such as a condom. 
No studies have been done on the use of Telzir/ritonavir with other hormonal therapies, such as 
hormone replacement therapy (HRT). </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby:<br />

Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with  HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. It is not known whether the ingredients in Telzir can also pass into your 
breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with 
your doctor as soon as possible.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Telzir can make you feel dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert.<br />
  Don t drive or operate machinery unless you re feeling well.  </p>
<p>Stay in regular contact with your doctor<br />
Telzir helps to control your condition, but it is not a cure for HIV infection.  You need to keep taking 
it every day to stop your illness getting worse.  You may still develop other infections and illnesses 
linked to HIV infection.<br />
  Keep in touch with your doctor, and don t stop taking Telzir without your doctor s advice.   </p>

<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them. When treating 
HIV, it can be hard to tell whether side effects are caused by Telzir, by other medicines taken at the

about any changes in your health. </p>

<p>You may experience muscle problems 
There have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with antiretroviral 
therapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions, these muscle 
disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis).  If you notice any muscle problems: 
 Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Haemophiliacs may bleed more 
In patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while 
taking protease inhibitors.<br />
If this happens to you: 
 Talk to your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you get any side effects 
 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet.  </p>
<p>Other side effects of combination therapy for HIV 
Old infections may flare up 
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections).  When these people start treatment, they may 
find that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation.  These 
symptoms are probably caused by the body s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body 
starts to fight these infections. </p>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection or signs of inflammation while you re taking Telzir: 
 Tell your doctor immediately.  Don t take other medicines for the infection without your 
doctor s advice.  </p>
<p>You may have problems with your bones<br />
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. 
People may be more likely to get this condition: 
* if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
* if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
* if they drink alcohol 
* if their immune systems are very weak 
* if they are overweight. 
Signs to look out for include:<br />
* stiffness in the joints 
* aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
* difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
 Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
