- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).
- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called
DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of
the face, lips, tongue or throat.
- if certain kinds of blood cells are severely reduced (myelosuppression), such as your white
blood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and
for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of
these cells before you begin treatment.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temodal,
- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection
called Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient
(glioblastoma multiforme) you may be receiving Temodal for 42 days in combination with
radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type
of pneumonia (PCP).
- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temodal could
cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be
carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started.
- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood
clotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your
doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. You may also
need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with Temodal. Your
blood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temodal on your
blood cells.
- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia.
- if you have nausea (feeling sick in your stomach) and/or vomiting which are very common side
effects of Temodal (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) to
help prevent vomiting. 
If you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take
Temodal until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do not take a
second dose on the same day. 
- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately.
- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infections, bruising or
bleeding.
- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temodal may need to be adjusted.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is
limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temodal. 
Other medicines and Temodal
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with
Temodal during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor.
Effective contraceptive precautions must be taken by female patients who are able to become pregnant
during treatment with Temodal, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment.
You should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temodal.
Male fertility
Temodal may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception and not
father a child for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on
conservation of sperm prior to treatment.
Driving and using machines
Temodal may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or machines or
cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4).
Temodal contains lactose
This medicine contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Temodal contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .</p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Dosage and duration of treatment
Your doctor will work out your dose of Temodal. This is based on your size (height and weight) and if
you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. 
You may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temodal to
prevent or control nausea and vomiting.
Patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme:
If you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first</li>
<li>followed by treatment with only Temodal (monotherapy phase).
During the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temodal at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual dose). You
will take this dose every day for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. The
Temodal dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your
medicine during the concomitant phase.
Once the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body
a chance to recover.
Then, you will start the monotherapy phase.
During the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temodal will be different. Your doctor will
work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 days.
You will take your new dose of Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days ( dosing days ) of each
cycle. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. Then you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to
a 28-day treatment cycle. 
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temodal once daily for 5 days followed
by 23 days without Temodal. The Temodal dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped depending on
your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle.
Patients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma
multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temodal only:
A treatment cycle with Temodal lasts 28 days. 
You will take Temodal alone once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on whether or not
you have received chemotherapy before.
If you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temodal will be
200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with chemotherapy,
your first dose of Temodal will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days.
Then, you will have 23 days without Temodal. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle.
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temodal once daily for 5 days,
followed by 23 days without Temodal.
Before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temodal dose needs to be
adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle.
How to take Temodal
Take your prescribed dose of Temodal once a day, preferably at the same time each day.
Take the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat
breakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the
capsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you
accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water. 
Depending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule together, eventually
with different strengths (content of active substance, in mg). The colour of the capsule cap is different
for each strength (see in the table below). 
Strength
Colour of the cap
Temodal     5 mg hard capsules
green
Temodal   20 mg hard capsules 
yellow
Temodal 100 mg hard capsules 
pink
Temodal 140 mg hard capsules 
blue
Temodal 180 mg hard capsules 
orange
Temodal 250 mg hard capsules 
white
You should make sure you fully understand and remember the following:</li>
<li>how many capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to write it
down (including the colour). </li>
<li>which days are your dosing days.
Review the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the
last cycle.
Always take Temodal exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check with your
doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Errors in how you take this medicine may have serious health
consequences. 
If you take more Temodal than you should
If you accidentally take more Temodal capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, pharmacist
or nurse immediately.
If you forget to take Temodal
Take the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with
your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to
do so.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</li>

Temodal treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause you to have
increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced resistance
to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may be
prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will monitor
your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In some
cases, your Temodal dose will be reduced or treatment stopped.
