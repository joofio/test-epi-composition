- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called 
DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include feeling itchy, breathlessness or wheezing, swelling of 
the face, lips, tongue or throat. 
- if certain kinds of blood cells are severely reduced (myelosuppression), such as your white 
blood cell count and platelet count. These blood cells are important for fighting infection and 
for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of 
these cells before you begin treatment. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temomedac, 
- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection 
called Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you are a newly-diagnosed patient 
(glioblastoma multiforme) you may be receiving Temomedac for 42 days in combination with 
radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type 
of pneumonia (PCP). 
- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temomedac 
could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will 
be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. 
- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood 
clotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your 
doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. You may also 
need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with Temomedac. 
Your blood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temomedac 
on your blood cells.<br />
- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. 
- if you have nausea (feeling sick in your stomach) and/or vomiting which are very common side 
effects of Temomedac (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-
emetic) to help prevent vomiting. 
- if you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take 
Temomedac until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do not take 
a second dose on the same day. 
- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection, contact your doctor immediately. 
- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infections, bruising or 
bleeding. 
- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temomedac may need to be adjusted. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is 
limited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temomedac.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Temomedac 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with 
Temomedac during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. </p>
<p>Effective contraceptive precautions must be taken by female patients who are able to become pregnant<br />
during treatment with Temomedac, and for at least 6 months following completion of treatment. </p>
<p>You should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temomedac. </p>
<p>Male fertility 
Temomedac may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception and not 
father a child for at least 3 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on 
conservation of sperm prior to treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Temomedac may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or machines 
or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). </p>
<p>Temomedac contains lactose 
Temomedac contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Temomedac contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>
<p>Additional information for Temomedac 20 mg hard capsules 
The excipient sunset yellow FCF (E110) included in the capsules shell may cause allergic reactions. </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Dosage and duration of treatment </p>
<p>Your doctor will work out your dose of Temomedac. This is based on your size (height and weight) 
and if you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. 
You may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temomedac to 
prevent or control nausea and vomiting. </p>
<p>Patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme 
If you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first </li>
<li>followed by treatment with only Temomedac (monotherapy phase). </li>
</ul>
<p>During the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temomedac at a dose of 75 mg/m  (usual dose). 
You will take this dose every day for 42 days (up to 49 days) in combination with radiotherapy. The 
Temomedac dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate 
your medicine during the concomitant phase. 
Once the radiotherapy is completed, you will interrupt treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body 
a chance to recover. 
Then, you will start the monotherapy phase. </p>
<p>During the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temomedac will be different. Your doctor 
will work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 
28 days. You will take your new dose of Temomedac alone once daily for the first 5 days ( dosing 
days ) of each cycle. The first dose will be 150 mg/m . Then you will have 23 days without 
Temomedac. This adds up to a 28 day treatment cycle. 
After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temomedac once daily for 5 days 
followed by 23 days without Temomedac. The Temomedac dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped 
depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle. </p>
<p>Patients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma 
multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temomedac only </p>
<p>A treatment cycle with Temomedac lasts 28 days. 
You will take Temomedac alone once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on whether or 
not you have received chemotherapy before. </p>
<p>If you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temomedac will be 
200 mg/m  once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with chemotherapy, 
your first dose of Temomedac will be 150 mg/m  once daily for the first 5 days. 
Then, you will have 23 days without Temomedac. This adds up to a 28 day treatment cycle. </p>
<p>After Day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temomedac once daily for 5 days, 
followed by 23 days without Temomedac. </p>
<p>Before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temomedac dose needs to be 
adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle. </p>
<p>How to take Temomedac </p>
<p>Take your prescribed dose of Temomedac once a day, preferably at the same time each day. </p>
<p>Take the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat 
breakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the 
capsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you 
accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.<br />
Depending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule together, eventually 
with different strengths (content of active substance, in mg). The colour and marking of the capsule is 
different for each strength (see table below). </p>
<p>Strength

two stripes in green ink on the cap 
and  T 5 mg  in green ink on the

<p>You should make sure you fully understand and remember the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to write it 
down (including the colour). </li>
<li>which days are your dosing days. 
Review the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the 
last cycle. </li>
</ul>
<p>Always take Temomedac exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check with your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Errors in how you take this medicine may have serious health 
consequences. </p>
<p>If you take more Temomedac than you should 
If you accidentally take more Temomedac capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Temomedac 
Take the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with 
your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to 
do so. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Temomedac treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause you to 
have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced 
resistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may 
be prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will 
monitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In 
some cases, your Temomedac dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. </p>
