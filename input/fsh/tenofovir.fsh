  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil. This active substance 
is an antiretroviral or antiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both. 
Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by 
interfering with the normal working of enzymes (in HIV reverse transcriptase; in hepatitis B DNA 
polymerase) that are essential for the viruses to reproduce themselves. In HIV Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan should always be used combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus) infection. The tablets are suitable for: 
* adults 
* adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who have already been treated with other HIV 
medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, or have 
caused side effects. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an 
infection with HBV (hepatitis B virus). The tablets are suitable for: 
* adults 
* adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years. </p>
<p>You do not have to have HIV to be treated with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan for HBV. </p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan you may 
still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You can also pass on HBV 
to others, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6. If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately and do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan does not reduce the risk of passing on HBV to others through 
sexual contact or blood contamination. You must continue to take precautions to avoid this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown 
problems with your kidneys. Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be given to adolescents 
with existing kidney problems. Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to 
assess your kidney function. Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may affect your kidneys during 
treatment. Your doctor may order blood tests during treatment to monitor how your kidneys 
work. If you are an adult, your doctor may advise you to take the tablets less often. Do not 
reduce the prescribed dose, unless your doctor has told you to do so. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your 
kidneys (see Other medicines and Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan). If this is unavoidable, your 
doctor will monitor your kidney function once a week. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bone problems. Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may 
develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, 
alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may 
be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint 
stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in 
movement. If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes 
resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, 
Possible side effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone loss 
was seen in clinical studies when patients were treated with tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with a boosted protease inhibitor. </p>
<p>Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture 
risk in adult and paediatric patients are uncertain.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis are 
at a higher risk for fractures. </p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a 
higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. If you have hepatitis B infection, 
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for you. If you have a history of liver 
disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests to monitor your 
liver function. </li>
<li>Look out for infections. If you have advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and have an infection, 
you may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of an 
existing infection once treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is started. These symptoms 
may indicate that your body s improved immune system is fighting infection. Look out for 
signs of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. If 
you notice signs of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor at once. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk 
of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to 
seek necessary treatment. </p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are over 65. Tenofovir disoproxil has not been 
studied in patients over 65 years of age. If you are older than this and are prescribed 
Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, your doctor will monitor you carefully. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are suitable for: 
* HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg and who 
have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due 
to development of resistance, or have caused side effects 
* HBV infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 245 mg tablets are not suitable for the following groups: 
* Not for HIV-1 infected children under 12 years of age 
* Not for HBV infected children under 12 years of age.<br />
For dosage see section 3, How to take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. 
Other medicines and Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Don t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your doctor when you start Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan if you have both HBV and HIV. 
* Do not take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan if you are already taking other medicines 
containing tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. Do not take Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan together with medicines containing adefovir dipivoxil (a medicine used to treat 
chronic hepatitis B). </p>
<ul>
<li>It is very important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines that may damage 
your kidneys. </li>
</ul>
<p>These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), </li>
<li>amphotericin B (for fungal infection), </li>
<li>foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), </li>
<li>interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), </li>
<li>adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), </li>
<li>tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), </li>
<li>
<p>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine 
in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic 
acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported 
when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your 
doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and 
didanosine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with food and drink 
Take Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with food (for example, a meal or a snack). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Try to avoid getting pregnant during treatment with Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. You must 
use an effective method of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have taken Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan during your pregnancy, your doctor may 
request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. 
In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection 
against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a mother with HBV, and your baby has been given treatment to prevent hepatitis B 
transmission at birth, you may be able to breast-feed your infant, but first talk to your doctor to get 
more information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, 
you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy while taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, 
do not drive or ride a bicycle and do not use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains lactose 
Tell your doctor before taking Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. If you have been told by your doctor 
that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
