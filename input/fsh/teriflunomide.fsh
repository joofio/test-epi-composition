  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Teriflunomide Mylan is 
Teriflunomide Mylan contains the active substance teriflunomide which is an immunomodulatory 
agent and adjusts the immune system to limit its attack on the nervous system. </p>
<p>What Teriflunomide Mylan is used for 
Teriflunomide is used in adults and in children and adolescents (10 years of age and older) to treat 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). </p>
<p>What multiple sclerosis is 
MS is a long-term illness that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of the 
brain and spinal cord. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective sheath (called 
myelin) around the nerves in the CNS. This loss of myelin is called demyelination. This stops nerves 
from working properly. </p>
<p>People with relapsing form of multiple sclerosis will have repeated attacks (relapses) of physical 
symptoms caused by their nerves not working properly. These symptoms vary from patient to patient 
but usually involve: 
 
difficulty walking 
 
vision problems 
 
balance problems. </p>
<p>Symptoms may disappear completely after the relapse is over, but over time, some problems may 
remain between relapses. This can cause physical disabilities that may interfere with your daily 
activities. </p>
<p>How Teriflunomide Mylan works 
Teriflunomide Mylan helps to protect against attacks on the central nervous system by the immune 
system by limiting the increase of some white blood cells (lymphocytes). This limits the inflammation 
that leads to nerve damage in MS. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to teriflunomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
- if you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores after 
taking teriflunomide or leflunomide 
- if you have severe liver problems 
- if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are breast-feeding 
- if you suffer from a serious problem which affects your immune system e.g. acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
- if you have a serious problem with your bone marrow, or if you have low numbers of red or 
white cells in your blood or a reduced number of blood platelets 
- if you are suffering from a serious infection 
- if you have severe kidney problems which require dialysis 
- if you have very low levels of proteins in your blood (hypoproteinaemia). </p>
<p>If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Teriflunomide Mylan if: 
- you have liver problems, and/or if you drink large amounts of alcohol. Your doctor will carry 
out blood tests before and during treatment to check how well your liver is working. If your test 
results show a problem with your liver, your doctor may stop your treatment with Teriflunomide 
Mylan. Please read section 4. - you have high blood pressure (hypertension) whether it is controlled with medicines or not. 
Teriflunomide Mylan can cause an increase in blood pressure. Your doctor will check your 
blood pressure before the start of treatment and regularly thereafter. Please read section 4. - you have an infection. Before you take Teriflunomide Mylan, your doctor will make sure you 
have enough white blood cells and platelets in your blood. As Teriflunomide Mylan decreases 
the number of white cells in the blood this may affect your ability to fight the infection. Your 
doctor may do blood tests to check your white blood cells if you think you have an infection. 
Please read section 4. - you have severe skin reactions 
- you have respiratory symptoms 
- you have weakness, numbness and pain in the hands and feet 
- you are going to have a vaccination 
- you take leflunomide with Teriflunomide Mylan 
- you are switching to or from Teriflunomide Mylan 
- you are due to have a specific blood test (calcium level). Falsely low levels of calcium can be 
detected. </p>
<p>Respiratory reactions 
Tell your doctor if you have unexplained cough and dyspnoea (shortness of breath). Your doctor may 
perform additional tests. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Teriflunomide Mylan is not intended for use in children under 10 years of age, as it has not been 
studied in MS patients in this age group. 
The warnings and precautions listed above also apply to children. The following information is 
important for children and their caregivers: 
- inflammation of the pancreas has been observed in patients receiving teriflunomide. Your 
child’s doctor may carry out blood tests if an inflammation to the pancreas is suspected. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Teriflunomide Mylan<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
- leflunomide, methotrexate and other medicines that affect the immune system (often called 
immunosuppressants or immunomodulators) 
- rifampicin (a medicine used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) 
- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin for epilepsy 
- St John’s wort (a herbal medicine for depression) 
- repaglinide, pioglitazone, nateglinide, or rosiglitazone for diabetes 
- daunorubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or topotecan for cancer 
- duloxetine for depression, urinary incontinence or in kidney disease in diabetics 
- alosetron for the management of severe diarrhoea 
- theophylline for asthma 
- tizanidine, a muscle relaxant 
- warfarin, an anticoagulant used to make the blood thinner (i.e. more fluid) in order to avoid 
blood clots 
- oral contraceptives (containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) 
- cefaclor, benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), ciprofloxacin for infections 
- indometacin, ketoprofen for pain or inflammation 
- furosemide for heart disease 
- cimetidine for reducing gastric acid 
- zidovudine for HIV infection 
- rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) 
- sulfasalazine for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis 
- cholestyramine for high cholesterol or relief from itching in liver disease 
- activated charcoal to reduce absorption of medicines or other substances. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Do not take Teriflunomide Mylan if you are, or think you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant or 
become pregnant while taking Teriflunomide Mylan the risk of having a baby with birth defects is 
increased. Women of childbearing potential must not take this medicine without using reliable 
contraceptive measures. 
If your child/adolescent daughter reaches menses while taking teriflunomide, you should inform the 
doctor, who will provide specialist counselling regarding contraception and the potential risks in case 
of pregnancy. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after stopping treatment with Teriflunomide Mylan as 
you need to ensure that most of this medicine has left your body before trying to become pregnant. 
The elimination of the active substance may take up to 2 years to occur naturally. The time can be 
reduced to a few weeks by taking certain medicines which speed up removal of Teriflunomide Mylan 
from your body. 
In either case it should be confirmed by a blood test that the active substance has been sufficiently 
removed from your body and you need confirmation from your treating physician that the blood level 
of Teriflunomide Mylan is low enough to allow you to become pregnant. </p>
<p>For further information on the laboratory testing please contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you suspect that you are pregnant while taking Teriflunomide Mylan or in the two years after you 
have stopped treatment, you must discontinue Teriflunomide Mylan and contact your doctor 
immediately for a pregnancy test. If the test confirms that you are pregnant, your doctor may suggest 
treatment with certain medicines to remove Teriflunomide Mylan rapidly and sufficiently from your 
body, as this may decrease the risk to your baby. </p>
<p>Contraception </p>
<p>You must use an effective method of contraception during and after treatment with Teriflunomide 
Mylan.<br />
Teriflunomide remains in your blood for a long time after you stop taking it. Continue to use effective 
contraception after you stop treatment. 
 
Do this until the levels of Teriflunomide Mylan in your blood are low enough - your doctor will 
check this. 
 
Talk with your doctor about the best method of contraception for you and any potential need for 
contraception change. </p>
<p>Do not take Teriflunomide Mylan when you are breast-feeding, as teriflunomide passes into the breast 
milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Teriflunomide Mylan might make you feel dizzy which may impair your ability to concentrate and 
react. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Teriflunomide Mylan contains lactose 
Teriflunomide Mylan contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you 
have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Teriflunomide Mylan contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""
