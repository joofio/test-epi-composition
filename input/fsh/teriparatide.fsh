<p>Troubleshooting 
Problem 
A. The yellow shaft is 
still showing after I 
push<br />
in the black injection 
button.<br />
How do I reset my<br />
Teriparatide SUN?  </p>
<p>Solution  </p>
<p>To reset the Teriparatide SUN, follow the steps 
below. 
1) The recommended dose is 20 micrograms given 
once daily. If you have already injected, DO 
NOT inject yourself a second time on the same 
day. 
2) Remove the needle. 
3) Attach a new needle, pull off the large needle 
cover and save it. 
4) Pull out the black injection button until it stops. 
Check to make sure the red stripe shows. (See 
step 3) 
5) Pull off the small needle protector and throw 
away. 
6) Point the needle down into an empty container. 
Push in the black injection button until it stops. 
Hold it in and count to 5 s-l-o-w-l-y. You may 
see a small stream or drop of fluid. When you 
have finished, the black injection button 
should be all the way in. 
7) If you still see the yellow shaft showing, please 
contact your doctor or pharmacist 
8) Put the large needle cover on needle. Unscrew 
the needle all the way by giving the needle 
cover 3 to 5 complete turns. Pull off needle 
cover and throw away as directed by your 
doctor or pharmacist. Push the white cap back 
on, and place Teriparatide SUN in the 
refrigerator. (See step 6) </p>
<p>You can prevent this problem by always using a 
NEW needle for each injection, and by pushing 
the black injection button all the way in and 
counting to 5 s-l-o-w-l-y. </p>
<p>B. How do I know if my 
Teriparatide SUN 
works? </p>
<p>The Teriparatide SUN is designed to inject the full 
dose every time it is used according to the 
directions in the section How to use. The black 
injection button will be all the way in to show that 
the full dose has been injected from the 
Teriparatide SUN. </p>
<p>Remember to use a new needle every time you 
inject to be sure your Teriparatide SUN will work 
properly. </p>
<p>C. I see an air bubble in 
my Teriparatide SUN. </p>
<p>A small air bubble will not affect your dose nor 
will it harm you. You can continue to take your 
dose as usual. </p>
<p>D. I cannot get the 
needle off. </p>
<p>1) Put the large needle cover on the needle. (See 
step 6) 
2) Use the large needle cover to unscrew the 
needle. 
3) Unscrew the needle all the way by giving the 
large needle cover 3 to 5 complete turns. 
4) If you still cannot get the needle off, ask 
someone to help you. </p>
<p>E. What should I do if I 
cannot pull out the black 
injection button? </p>
<p>Change to a new Teriparatide SUN to take your 
dose as directed by your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>This indicates that you have now used all the medicine 
that can be injected accurately even though you may 
still see some medicine left in the cartridge.  </p>
