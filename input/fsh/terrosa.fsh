<p>Warnings and precautions 
Terrosa may increase calcium in your blood or urine.

may be signs there is too much calcium in your blood. 
* if you suffer from kidney stones or have had kidney stones.

<p>Some patients get dizzy or get a fast heartbeat after the first few doses of Terrosa. For the first doses, 
inject Terrosa in a place where you can sit or lie down right away if you get dizzy. </p>
<p>The recommended treatment time of 24 months should not be exceeded. </p>
<p>Before inserting a cartridge in Terrosa Pen write down the batch (Lot) number of the cartridge and its

Terrosa should not be used in children and adolescents (aged less than 18 years). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Terrosa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
This is important, because some medicines (e.g. digoxin/digitalis, a medicine used to treat heart 
disease) may interact with teriparatide. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Terrosa if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are a woman of child-bearing 
potential, you should use effective methods of contraception during use of Terrosa. If you become 
pregnant while using Terrosa, Terrosa should be discontinued. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice before taking this medicine. </p>

<p>The recommended dose is 20 micrograms (corresponding to 80 microliters) given once a day by 
injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in the thigh or abdomen. </p>
<p>To help you remember to use your medicine, inject it at about the same time each day. Terrosa can be 
injected at meal times. Inject Terrosa each day for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. The 
total duration of treatment with Terrosa should not exceed 24 months. You should not receive more 
than one treatment course of 24 months over your lifetime. </p>
<p>Your doctor may advise you to use Terrosa with calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will tell you how 
much you should take each day. </p>
<p>Terrosa can be given with or without food. </p>
<p>Terrosa cartridges are designed to be used only with the Terrosa Pen reusable, multidose medicine 
delivery system and compatible pen needles. The pen and injection needles are not included with 
Terrosa. However, for treatment initiation a cartridge and pen pack should be used containing one 
inner carton of Terrosa cartridge and one inner carton of Terrosa Pen. 
The pen can be used with injection needles developed according to the pen needle ISO standard of a 
gauge between 29 G and 31 G (diameter 0.25   0.33 mm) and a length between 5 mm to 12.7 mm for 
subcutaneous injection only. </p>
<p>Before the first use, insert the cartridge into the pen. For the correct use of this medicine it is very 
important to closely follow the detailed Instructions for Use of your pen which are provided with the 
pen. </p>
<p>Use a new injection needle for each injection to prevent contamination and safely dispose of the 
needle after use. 
Never store your pen with the needle attached. 
Never share your pen with others. 
Do not use your Terrosa Pen to inject any other medicine (e.g. insulin). 
The pen is customised for use with Terrosa only. 
Do not refill the cartridge. 
Do not transfer the medicine into a syringe. </p>
<p>You should inject Terrosa shortly after you take the pen with inserted cartridge out of the refrigerator. 
Put the pen with inserted cartridge back into the refrigerator immediately after you have used it. Do 
not remove the cartridge from the pen after each use. Store it in the cartridge holder during the whole 
28-day treatment period. </p>
<p>Preparing the pen for use 
- To ensure the correct administration of Terrosa always read the Instructions for Use of Terrosa 
Pen, which is included in the carton of the pen. 
- Wash your hands before handling the cartridge or pen. 
- Check the expiry date on the cartridge label before inserting the cartridge into the pen. Make 
sure that there are at least 28 days remaining before its expiry date. Insert the cartridge into the 
pen before the first use as detailed in the pen instructions. Write down the batch (Lot) number of 
each cartridge and its first injection date on a calendar. The date of first injection should also be 
recorded on the outer carton of Terrosa (see the provided space on the box: {First use:}). 
- After inserting a new cartridge and before the first injection from this cartridge prime the pen 
according to the instructions which are provided. Do not prime again after the first dose. </p>
<p>Injecting Terrosa 
- Before you inject Terrosa, clean your skin where you intend to inject (thigh or abdomen) as 
instructed by your doctor. 
- Gently hold a fold of cleansed skin and insert the needle straight into the skin. Press the push 
button and hold it pressed in until the dose indication has returned to the start position. 
- After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for six seconds to make sure that you receive 
the whole dose. 
- As soon as you have finished the injection, attach the outer needle protective cap on the pen 
needle and screw the cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. This will keep the remaining 
Terrosa sterile and prevent leaking from the pen. It will also stop air going back into the 
cartridge and the needle from clogging. 
- Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. </p>
<p>If you use more Terrosa than you should 
If, by mistake, you have used more Terrosa than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
The expected effects of overdose include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Terrosa 
If you forget an injection or cannot use your medicine at your usual time, inject it as soon as possible 
on that day. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not take more than one 
injection in the same day. </p>
<p>If you stop using Terrosa 
If you are considering stopping Terrosa treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor 
will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Terrosa. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
