</ol>
<p>Teysuno contains the active substances tegafur gimeracil and oteracil. </p>
<p>Teysuno belongs to the fluoropyrimidine class of medicines known as  antineoplastic agents  which 
stop the growth of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Teysuno is prescribed by doctors for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The treatment of adults with advanced stomach (gastric) cancer and is taken with cisplatin, 
another anti-cancer medicine. </li>
<li>The treatment of cancer of the large intestines and rectum which has spread (metastasized) 
and where it is not possible to continue with another fluoropyrimidine (anti-cancer treatments 
from the same group of medicines as Teysuno) due to side effects on the skin of hands or feet 
(hand-foot syndrome) or on the heart. In these patients, Teysuno is used alone or in 
combination with other anticancer medicines. </li>
</ul>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Teysuno if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>blood disorders </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kidney disease </p>
</li>
<li>stomach and/or bowel problems such as pain, diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration </li>
<li>eye disorders, such as  dry eye  or increased tearing </li>
<li>a current or previous infection of the liver with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely </li>
<li>a partial deficiency in the activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) </li>
<li>a family member who has partial or complete deficiency of the enzyme 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) </li>
</ul>
<p>DPD deficiency: DPD deficiency is a genetic condition that is not usually associated with health 
problems unless you receive certain medicines. If you have DPD deficiency and take Teysuno, you are 
at an increased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 Possible side effects). It is 
recommended to test you for DPD deficiency before start of treatment. If you have no activity of the 
enzyme you should not take Teysuno. If you have a reduced enzyme activity (partial deficiency) your 
doctor might prescribe a reduced dose. If you have negative test results for DPD deficiency, severe 
and life-threatening side effects may still occur. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Teysuno is not recommended for children under 18 years of age. </p>

<p>Also, you need to be particularly careful if you are taking any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>other fluoropyrimidine based medicines such as the anti-fungal flucytosine. Teysuno cannot be 
substituted for other oral fluoropyrimidine medicine. </li>
<li>inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2A6 which activates Teysuno such as tranylcypromine and 
methoxsalen </li>
<li>folinic acid (often used in chemotherapy with methotrexate) </li>

symptoms are easily identified as side effects by the patients themselves, a blood test is required to 
identify some other symptoms. Your doctor will discuss this with you and will explain the possible 
risks and benefits of the treatment. </p>
<p>Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) include: </p>
<p>-Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation * If you experience diarrhoea more than 4 times a day or in the middle of the night, or if you 
experience sore mouth accompanied by diarrhoea, stop taking Teysuno and contact 
your doctor immediately. * If you experience diarrhoea, avoid high-fibre, fatty and spicy foods.

blood volume, and imbalance of salts or chemicals in the blood. * If you experience nausea and vomit a dose of medication, make sure you tell your doctor. 
Do not replace the dose that has been vomited. * If you vomit more than two times in 24 hours, stop taking Teysuno and contact your 
doctor immediately. * To help manage nausea and vomiting: </p>
<p>Lie down or take deep breaths when feeling nauseous </p>
<p>Avoid tight clothing

fatigue, breathlessness. * If you experience any of the above-mentioned symptoms, try not to work too hard and

bruises. Wear loose clothing to protect the skin. Brush your teeth and blow your nose 
gently.

skin, dizziness, cramping * Try to eat frequent small meals. Avoid fatty and strong-smelling food. Even if you do 
not feel hungry, continue to eat as much as you can to maintain good nutrition. * If you feel tired and have fever together with loss of appetite, contact your doctor
