Tezspire contains the active substance tezepelumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are 
proteins that recognise and bind to a specific target substance in the body, which in the case of 
tezepelumab is a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP plays a key role in 
causing the inflammation in your airways that leads to the signs and symptoms of asthma. By blocking 
the action of TSLP, this medicine helps to reduce inflammation and asthma symptoms. 
What Tezspire is used for
Tezspire is used with other asthma medicines to treat severe asthma in adults and adolescents 
(12 years of age and older) when the disease is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. 
How Tezspire can help
Tezspire may reduce the number of asthma attacks you experience, improve your breathing and reduce 
your asthma symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

section 6). If this applies to you, or if you are not sure, check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tezspire.</p>
<p>Tezspire is not a rescue medicine. Do not use it to treat a sudden asthma attack. </p>
<p>If your asthma is not getting any better, or it gets worse during treatment with this medicine, 
talk to a doctor or nurse.</p>
<p>Look out for signs of allergic reactions. Medicines like Tezspire can potentially cause serious 
allergic reactions in some people. The signs of these reactions may vary, but can include
swelling of your face, tongue or mouth, breathing problems, fast heartbeat, fainting, dizziness, 
feeling lightheaded, hives and rash. If you notice any of these signs, speak to a doctor or nurse 
immediately.
Talk to your doctor about how to recognise early signs of allergy, and how to manage reactions 
if they occur.</p>
<h2>Look out for any signs of a possible serious infection while you are taking Tezspire such as:</h2>
<h2>fever, flu-like symptoms, night sweats;</h2>
<h2>cough which will not go away;</h2>
<p>warm, red and painful skin, or a painful skin rash with blisters. 
If you notice any of these signs, speak to a doctor or nurse immediately.
If you already have a serious infection, talk to your doctor before taking Tezspire.</p>
<h2>Look out for any symptoms of a heart problem, such as:</h2>
<h2>chest pain;</h2>
<h2>shortness of breath;</h2>
<h2>a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or lack of well-being;</h2>

If you notice any of these symptoms, speak to a doctor or nurse immediately.</p>
<p>If you have a parasitic infection or if you live in (or travel to) an area where parasitic 
infections are common, talk to your doctor. Tezspire may weaken your body s ability to fight 
certain types of parasitic infections.
Children
Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age because the safety and benefits of this 
medicine are not known in children in this age group.
Other medicines for asthma</p>
<p>Do not suddenly stop taking your other asthma medicines when you start Tezspire. This is 
especially important if you take steroids (also called corticosteroids). These medicines must be 
stopped gradually, under the supervision of your doctor and based on your response to Tezspire.
Other medicines and Tezspire
Tell your doctor or pharmacist:</p>
<p>if you are taking, have recently taken or might use any other medicines.</p>
<p>if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Do not use Tezspire during pregnancy unless your doctor advises it. It is not known if Tezspire
can harm your unborn baby.</p>
<p>Tezspire may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your 
doctor.
Driving and using machines
Tezspire is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.
