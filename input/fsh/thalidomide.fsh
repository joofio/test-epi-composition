Thalidomide BMS contains an active substance called thalidomide. This belongs to a group of 
medicines which affect how your immune system works. </p>
<p>What Thalidomide BMS is used for 
Thalidomide BMS is used with two other medicines called  melphalan  and  prednisone  to treat 
adults with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma. It is used in people who have recently been 
diagnosed and who have not been prescribed another medicine for their multiple myeloma before who 
are aged 65 years and over, or aged less than 65 years who cannot be treated with high dose 
chemotherapy, which can be very difficult for the body to handle. </p>
<p>What is multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain type of white blood cell, called the 
plasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide out of control. This can damage the 
bone and kidneys. Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms 
can be greatly reduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a  remission . </p>
<p>How Thalidomide BMS works 
Thalidomide BMS works by helping the body s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It 
works in a number of different ways: 
* by stopping the cancer cells developing 
* by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer 
* by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine in the following situations: </p>
<p>For women taking Thalidomide BMS 
Before starting the treatment, you should ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if 
you think this is unlikely. Even if you do not have a menstrual bleeding following cancer therapy, you 
may become pregnant. 
If you are able to become pregnant: 
* Your doctor will make sure that you have pregnancy tests * before treatment * every 4 weeks during treatment * 4 weeks after stopping treatment 
* You must use one effective method of contraception: * for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment  * during treatment * until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment 
Your doctor will tell you what method of contraception to use. </p>
<p>If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each prescription that the necessary 
measures, as outlined above, have been taken  </p>
<p>For men taking Thalidomide BMS 
Thalidomide passes into semen. Therefore, do not have unprotected intercourse, even if you had a 
vasectomy. 
* Pregnancy and any exposure during pregnancy must be avoided. Always use a condom: * during treatment  * for at least 7 days after stopping treatment 
* You must not donate semen:  * during treatment  * for at least 7 days after stopping treatment </p>
<p>For all patients 
Talk to your doctor before taking Thalidomide BMS if 
* you do not understand the contraception advice given to you by your doctor or if you do not feel 
able to follow this advice. 
* you have had a heart attack, have ever had a blood clot in the past, or if you smoke, have high 
blood pressure or high cholesterol levels. During the treatment with Thalidomide BMS you have 
an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins and arteries (see also section 4  Possible 
side effects ). <br />
<em> you have experienced or have existing neuropathy i.e. nerve damage causing tingling, abnormal 
co-ordination or pain in your hands or feet (see also section 4  Possible side effects ).  <br />
</em> you experienced or have existing slow heart rate (this may be a symptom of bradycardia). 
* you have high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (see also section 4  Possible side 
effects ). 
* you have a fall in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) accompanied by fever and 
infection. 
* you have a fall in the number of platelets. You will be more prone to bleeding and bruising. 
* you have or have had injury to the liver (hepatic disorders) including abnormal liver test results.<br />
<em> you experience or have experienced in the past severe skin reactions called Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
(which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity syndrome). (For description of 
symptoms see section 4  Possible side effects ).<br />
</em> you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking Thalidomide BMS such as rash, itching, swelling, 
dizziness or trouble breathing. 
* you have experienced sleepiness.<br />
<em> you have experienced fever, chills and severe shaking, and possibly complicated by low blood 
pressure and confusion (these may be symptoms of severe infections).<br />
</em> you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly varicella zoster, hepatitis B 
infection, or HIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with Thalidomide BMS may 
cause a virus to become active again in patients who carry it, resulting in a recurrence of the 
infection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection. 
* you have kidney or liver problems (see also section 4  Possible side effects ).  </p>
<p>Your thyroid function may be checked before you take thalidomide and monitored during treatment. </p>
<p>At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience: 
blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way 
you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of 
sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal 
brain condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these 
symptoms prior to treatment with Thalidomide BMS, tell your doctor about any change in these 
symptoms. </p>
<p>Your doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your 
bone marrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels 
of chemicals in the body which can lead to kidneys failure (this condition is called Tumour Lysis 
Syndrome) (see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>Your doctor should evaluate if you develop additional types of haematological malignancies (called 
acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) during your treatment with Thalidomide 
BMS (see also section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>You must not donate blood during Thalidomide BMS treatment and for at least 7 days after stopping 
treatment. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before taking Thalidomide 
BMS. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Thalidomide BMS is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Thalidomide BMS 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Make sure you tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines which: 
* cause sleepiness as thalidomide may increase their effects. This includes sedatives (such as 
anxiolytics, hypnotics, antipsychotics, H1 antihistamines, opiate derivatives and barbiturates). 
* slow the heart rate (induce bradycardia, such as anticholinesterases and beta blockers).<br />
* are used for heart problems and complications (such as digoxin), or for thinning the blood (such 
as warfarin). 
* are associated with neuropathy such as other treatments for cancer. 
* are used for contraception. </p>
<p>Thalidomide BMS with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not drink alcohol while you are taking Thalidomide BMS. This is because alcohol can make you 
sleepy and Thalidomide BMS can make you even sleepier. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Thalidomide causes severe birth defects or death to an unborn baby. 
* As little as one capsule taken by a pregnant woman can cause a baby to have serious birth 
defects. 
* These defects can include shortened arms or legs, malformed hands or feet, eye or ear defects, 
and problems with internal organs. 
If you are pregnant, you must not take Thalidomide BMS. In addition, you must not become pregnant 
while taking Thalidomide BMS. </p>
<p>You must use one effective method of contraception if you are a woman who is able to become 
pregnant (see section 2,  What you need to know before you take Thalidomide BMS ). </p>
<p>You must stop treatment and inform your doctor straight away if: 
* You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
* You have heterosexual intercourse without using an effective method of contraception. 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with thalidomide, you must stop the treatment and 
inform your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>For men taking Thalidomide BMS who have a female partner who is able to become pregnant, please 
see section 2  What you need to know before you take Thalidomide BMS . If your partner becomes 
pregnant whilst you are taking thalidomide, you should inform your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breastfeed when taking Thalidomide BMS as it is not known if thalidomide is passed into 
human breast milk. </p>

<p>Stop taking Thalidomide BMS and see a doctor straight away if you notice the following serious 
side effects   you may need urgent medical treatment: 
* Extremely intense and serious skin reactions. The adverse reaction of the skin may appear as 
rashes with or without blisters. Skin irritation, sores or swelling in the mouth, throat, eyes, 
nose and around the genitals, oedema and fever and flulike symptoms may occur. These 
symptoms may be signs of the rare and serious skin reactions Stevens-Johnson syndrome,

anaphylactic reaction (serious types of allergic reaction that may be manifested as hives, 
rashes, swelling of eyes, mouth or face, difficulty of breathing, or itching). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects: 
* Numbness, tingling, abnormal coordination or pain in your hands and feet. 
This may be due to nerve damage (called  peripheral neuropathy ), which is a very common side 
effect. It may become very severe, painful and disabling. If you experience such symptoms, speak 
to your doctor straight away, who may reduce the dose or discontinue the treatment. This side 
effect usually happens after you have been taking this medicine for several months but can 
happen sooner than this. It can also happen sometime after treatment has stopped. It may not go 
away, or may go away slowly. 
* Sudden pain in your chest or difficulty in breathing. 
This may be due to blood clots in the arteries leading to your lungs (called  pulmonary 
embolism ), which is a common side effect. These can happen during treatment, or after treatment 
has stopped. 
* Pain or swelling in your legs, especially in your lower leg or calves. 
This may be due to blood clots in the veins of your leg (deep vein thrombosis), which is a 
common side effect. These can happen during treatment, or after treatment has stopped. 
* Chest pain spreading to the arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach, feeling sweaty and 
breathless, feeling sick or vomiting.
