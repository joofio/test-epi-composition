<p>Thiotepa Riemser is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplantation. It works by destroying 
bone marrow cells. This enables the transplantation of new bone marrow cells (haematopoietic 
progenitor cells), which in turn enable the body to produce healthy blood cells. 
Thiotepa Riemser can be used in adults and children and adolescents. </p>         </div>"""

<li>heart or lung problems, </li>
<li>seizures/fits (epilepsy) or have had them in the past (if treated with phenytoin or fosphenytoin). </li>
</ul>
<p>Because Thiotepa Riemser destroys bone marrow cells responsible for producing blood cells, regular 
blood tests will be taken during treatment to check your blood cell counts. </p>
<p>In order to prevent and manage infections, you will be given anti-infectives. </p>
<p>Thiotepa Riemser may cause another type of cancer in the future. Your doctor will discuss this risk 
with you.

Thiotepa Riemser. You must not use Thiotepa Riemser during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Both women and men using Thiotepa Riemser must use effective contraceptive methods during 
treatment. Men should not father a child while treated and during the year after cessation of treatment. </p>
<p>It is not known whether this medicinal product is excreted in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, 
women must not breast-feed during treatment with Thiotepa Riemser. </p>
<p>Thiotepa Riemser can impair male and female fertility. Male patients should seek advice for sperm 
preservation before therapy is started. </p>
