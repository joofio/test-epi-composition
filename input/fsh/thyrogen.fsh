(TSH) manufactured using biotechnology processes. </p>
<p>Thyrogen is used to detect certain types of thyroid cancer in patients who have had their thyroid gland removed 
and who are taking thyroid hormones. One of the effects is that it stimulates any remaining thyroid tissue to take 
up iodine which is important for radioiodine imaging. It also stimulates the production of thyroglobulin and 
thyroid hormones if there is any thyroid tissue left. These hormones can be measured in your blood. </p>
<p>Thyrogen is also used with radioiodine treatment to eliminate (ablate) the thyroid tissue left over after surgical 
removal of the thyroid gland (remnant) in patients who do not have secondary cancer growths (metastases) and 
who are taking thyroid hormone. </p>         </div>"""

ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
* if you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Thyrogen 
* if you have kidney disease that requires dialysis and he will decide how much Thyrogen to give to you 
as you may have more chance of experiencing headache and nausea. 
* if you have reduced kidney function and he will decide how much radioiodine to give you. 
* if you have reduced liver function; you should still be able to receive Thyrogen. </p>
<p>Effect on tumour growth 
In patients with thyroid cancer, tumour growth has been reported during withdrawal of thyroid hormones for 
diagnostic procedures. This was thought to be related to the elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels 
over a longer period. It is possible that Thyrogen may also cause tumour growth. In clinical trials this was not 
seen. </p>
<p>Due to elevation of TSH levels after Thyrogen, patients with secondary cancer growths (metastases) can 
experience local swelling or bleeding at the site of these metastases which may become bigger. If the metastases 
are present in narrow spaces e.g. intracerebral (in the brain) or in the spinal cord, patients could experience 
symptoms which can occur quickly such as partial paralysis affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis), 
breathing problems or loss of vision.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide if you belong to a specific group of patients for which pre-treatment with 
corticosteroids is to be considered (for example, if you have secondary cancer growths in your brain or spinal 
cord). Please talk to your doctor about this if you have concerns. </p>
<p>Children<br />
Due to a lack of data on the use of Thyrogen in children, Thyrogen should be given to children only in 
exceptional circumstances. </p>
<p>Elderly<br />
No special precautions for elderly patients are necessary. However, if your thyroid gland has not been removed 
completely and you are also suffering from heart disease, your doctor will help you decide if Thyrogen should 
be given to you. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Thyrogen 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>There are no known drug interactions with Thyrogen and the thyroid hormones you may be taking. </p>
<p>Your doctor will determine the exact activity of radioiodine to use for radioiodine imaging, taking into 
consideration the fact that you continue to take thyroid hormones.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Thyrogen if you are pregnant. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or 
are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Thyrogen should not be given to breast-feeding women. Breast-feeding should only be resumed following 
advice from your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some patients may feel dizzy or have headaches after administration of Thyrogen which may affect the ability 
to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Thyrogen contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

Thyrogen. </p>
<p>Use in children

Patients who accidentally received too much Thyrogen have reported nausea, weakness, dizziness, headache, 
vomiting and hot flashes.  </p>
