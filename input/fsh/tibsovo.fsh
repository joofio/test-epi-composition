  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Tibsovo is 
Tibsovo contains the active substance ivosidenib. It is a medicine used to treat specific cancers that 
contain a mutated (changed) gene that makes a protein known as IDH1, which plays an important role 
in making energy for cells. When the IDH1 gene is mutated, the IDH1 protein is changed and does not 
function properly, and this results in changes in the cell which can lead to the development of cancer. 
Tibsovo blocks the mutated form of the IDH1 protein and helps to slow or stop the cancer from 
growing.  </p>
<p>What Tibsovo is used for 
Tibsovo is used to treat adults with: 
* acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). When used for patients with AML, Tibsovo will be given in 
combination with another anti-cancer medicine called  azacitidine . 
* bile duct cancer (also known as  cholangiocarcinoma ). Tibsovo is used on its own to treat patients 
whose bile duct cancer has spread to other parts of the body and who have been treated with at 
least one prior therapy. 
Tibsovo is only used in patients whose AML or bile duct cancer is related to a change (mutation) in 
the IDH1 protein. </p>         </div>"""

this medicine is the right treatment for you. </p>
<p>Do not take Tibsovo 
* if you are allergic to ivosidenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
* if you are already taking medicines such as dabigatran (a medicine used for preventing the 
formation of blood clots), St. John s wort (an herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety), 
rifampicin (a medicine used for treating bacterial infections) or certain medicines used to treat 
epilepsy (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin). 
* if you have a heart problem that you were born with called  congenital long QTc syndrome . 
* if you have a familial history of sudden death or an abnormal or irregular heartbeat in the lower 
chambers of the heart. 
* if you have a severe abnormality of electrical activity of the heart that affects its rhythm called 
 QTc prolongation . </p>
<p>Do not take Tibsovo if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
nurse. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>QTc interval prolongation: 
Tibsovo can cause a serious condition known as QTc interval prolongation which can cause 
irregular heartbeats and life-threatening arrythmias (abnormal electrical activity of the heart that 
affects its rhythm). Your doctor must check the electrical activity of your heart before and 
during treatment with Tibsovo (see  Regular tests ).<br />
Seek urgent medical attention if you feel dizzy, light-headed, palpitations or faint (see also 
section 4) after taking Tibsovo.<br />
During treatment, tell your doctors you are taking Tibsovo before starting any new medicine as 
these may increase the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm. </p>
<p>If you get any of the above serious side effects, your doctor may give you other medicines to treat 
them and they may tell you to stop taking Tibsovo for a while or stop taking it altogether. </p>
<p>Differentiation syndrome in patients with AML: </p>
<p>Tibsovo can cause a serious condition known as differentiation syndrome in patients with AML. 
This is a condition that affects your blood cells and may be life-threatening if not treated. </p>
<p>Seek urgent medical attention if you have any of the following symptoms after taking Tibsovo: 
  fever, 
  cough, 
  trouble breathing, 
  rash, 
  decreased urination, 
  dizziness or light-headedness, 
  rapid weight gain 
  swelling of your arms or legs. </p>
<p>These may be signs of differentiation syndrome. </p>
<p>The pack contains a patient alert card to carry with you at all times. It contains important 
information for you and your healthcare professionals about what to do if you get any of the 
symptoms of differentiation syndrome (see section 4). 
Talk to your doctor before taking Tibsovo if: 
* you have heart problems or have problems with abnormal electrolytes levels (such as 
sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium); 
* you are taking certain medicines that can affect the heart (e.g. those used to prevent 
arrhythmia called anti-arrhythmics, some antibiotics, some antifungals and those used to prevent 
nausea and vomiting - see  Other medicines and Tibsovo ); 
* you have kidney problems; 
* you have liver problems. </p>
<p>Regular tests 
You will be monitored closely by your doctor before and during treatment with Tibsovo. You will 
need to have regular electrocardiograms (ECGs; a recording of the electrical activity in your heart) to 
monitor your heartbeat. You will be given an ECG before you start treatment with Tibsovo, once a 
week for the first three weeks of treatment, and then monthly thereafter. Additional ECG may be given 
as instructed by your doctor. If you start taking certain medicines that can affect your heart, you will 
be given an ECG before starting and during treatment with the new medicine as needed. 
You will also have a blood test before starting treatment with Tibsovo and then regularly thereafter. 
If necessary, your doctor may reduce your dose of Tibsovo, interrupt it temporarily or stop it 
altogether. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years old because there is no 
information about its use in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tibsovo 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is 
because they may reduce how well Tibsovo works or increase the risk of side effects, or Tibsovo may 
affect the way these other medicines work.  </p>
<p>In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines so that they 
can decide if your treatment needs to change: 
* antibiotics used for bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, benzylpenicillin, 
ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin); 
* warfarin (used to prevent blood clots); 
* medicines used for fungal infections (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, 
isavuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole); 
* medicines that affect your heartbeat known as anti-arrhythmics (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, 
quinidine); 
* medicines used to stop nausea and vomiting known as anti-emetics (e.g. aprepitant, 
ondansetron, tropisetron, granisetron); 
* medicines used after organ transplants known as immunosuppressants (e.g. ciclosporin, 
everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus); 
* medicines used for HIV (e.g. raltegravir, ritonavir); 
* alfentanil (used for anaesthesia in surgery); 
* fentanyl (used for severe pain); 
* pimozide (used for schizophrenia); 
* medicines used for cancer (e.g. cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, paclitaxel); 
* methadone (used for morphine or heroin addiction, or severe pain); 
* medicines used for type 2 diabetes (e.g. pioglitazone, repaglinide); 
* omeprazole (used for stomach ulcers and acid reflux); 
* furosemide (used for fluid build-up known as oedema); 
* medicines used for high cholesterol known as statins (e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, 
rosuvastatin). 
* lamotrigine (used for epilepsy). </p>
<p>Tibsovo with food and drink 
Do not have grapefruit or grapefruit juice during treatment with Tibsovo as it can affect how this 
medicine works. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Tibsovo is not recommended for use during pregnancy as it may harm the unborn baby. Women of 
child-bearing age should have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Tibsovo and should 
avoid becoming pregnant during therapy.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you become pregnant 
whilst taking Tibsovo. </p>
<p>Contraception 
Tibsovo should not be used in pregnancy as it can harm the unborn baby. Women who might become 
pregnant or men with partners who might become pregnant must use effective contraception to avoid 
pregnancy during treatment with Tibsovo and for at least 1 month after the last dose.   </p>
<p>Tibsovo may stop hormonal contraceptives from working properly. If you or your partner use a 
hormonal contraceptive (e.g. birth control pills, or contraceptive patches or implants), you must also 
use a barrier method (e.g. condoms or a diaphragm) to avoid pregnancy. Talk to your doctor or nurse 
about the right contraceptive method for you. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known if Tibsovo passes into breast milk. Do not breast-feed your baby during treatment with 
Tibsovo and for at least 1 month after the last dose. </p>
<p>Fertility 
It is not known if Tibsovo affects fertility. If you are concerned about your fertility whilst taking 
Tibsovo talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines
