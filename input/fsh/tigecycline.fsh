<p>If you are allergic to tigecycline, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you are allergic to tetracycline class antibiotics (e.g., minocycline, doxycycline, etc.), you 
may be allergic to tigecycline. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Tigecycline Accord:  </p>
<p>If you have poor or slow wound healing. </p>
<p>If you are suffering from diarrhoea before you are given Tigecycline Accord. If you develop 
diarrhoea during or after your treatment, tell your doctor at once. Do not take any diarrhoea 
medicine without first checking with your doctor.   </p>
<p>If you have or previously had any side effects due to antibiotics belonging to the tetracycline 
class (e.g., skin sensitization to sun light, staining on developing teeth, pancreas inflammation, 
and alteration of certain laboratory values aimed at measuring how well your blood clots). </p>
<p>If you have, or previously had liver problems. Depending on the condition of your liver, your 
doctor may reduce the dose to avoid potential side effects. </p>
<p>If you have blockage of the bile ducts (cholestasis). </p>
<p>If you suffer from a bleeding disorder or are in treatment with anticoagulant drugs, as this 
medicine can interfere with blood coagulation. </p>
<p>During treatment with Tigecycline Accord: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you develop severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. 
These may be symptoms of acute pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas which may result in severe 
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting). </p>
<p>In certain serious infections, your doctor may consider to use Tigecycline Accord in 
combination with other antibiotics. </p>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you closely for the development of any other bacterial infections. If 
you develop another bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe a different antibiotic specific 
for the type of infection present. </p>
<p>Although antibiotics including Tigecycline Accord fight certain bacteria, other bacteria and 
fungi may continue to grow. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you closely for 
any potential infections and treat you if necessary. </p>
<p>Children 
Tigecycline Accord  is not to be used in children less than 8 years of age due to the lack of data on 
safety and efficacy in this age group and because it may induce permanent dental defects such as 
staining on the developing teeth. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tigecycline Accord<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Tigecycline Accord may prolong certain tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. It is 
important that you tell your doctor if you are taking medicines to avoid an excess of blood clotting 
(named anticoagulants). If this were the case, your doctor will monitor you closely.  </p>
<p>Tigecycline Accord may interfere with the contraceptive pill (birth control pill). Talk to your doctor 
about the need for an additional method of contraception while receiving Tigecycline Accord.  </p>
<p>Tigecycline Accord may increase the effect of medicines used to suppress the immune system (such as 
tacrolimus or cyclosporine). It is important that you tell your doctor if you are taking these medicines 
so you can be closely monitored. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tigecycline Accord may cause foetal harm. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>It is not known if tigecycline passes into breast milk in humans. Ask your doctor for advice before 
breast-feeding your baby.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Tigecycline Accord may cause side effects such as dizziness. This may impair your ability to drive or 
operate machinery.  </p>
<p>Tigecycline Accord contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-
free. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. </p>
<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Instructions for use and handling (see also 3. How Tigecycline Accord is given in this leaflet) </p>
<p>The powder should be reconstituted with 5.3 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for 
injection, dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection, or Lactated Ringer s solution for injection to 
achieve a concentration of 10 mg/ml of tigecycline. The vial should be gently swirled until the active 
substance is dissolved. Thereafter, 5 ml of the reconstituted solution should be immediately withdrawn 
from the vial and added to a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other suitable infusion container 
(e.g. glass bottle). </p>
<p>For a 100 mg dose, reconstitute using two vials into a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other 
suitable infusion container (e.g. glass bottle). </p>
<p>Note: The vial contains a 6 % overage. Thus, 5 ml of reconstituted solution is equivalent to 50 mg of 
the active substance. The reconstituted solution should be yellow to orange in colour; if not, the 
solution should be discarded. Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
and discolouration (e.g. green or black) prior to administration. </p>
<p>Tigecycline should be administered intravenously through a dedicated line or through a Y-site. If the 
same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several active substances, the line should be 
flushed before and after infusion of tigecycline with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution 
for injection or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection. Injection should be made with an 
infusion solution compatible with tigecycline and any other medicinal product(s) via this common 
line. </p>
<p>Compatible intravenous solutions include: sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, 
dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection, and Lactated Ringer s solution for injection. </p>
<p>When administered through a Y-site, compatibility of tigecycline diluted in sodium chloride 0.9 % for 
injection is demonstrated with the following medicinal products or diluents: amikacin, dobutamine, 
dopamine HCl, gentamicin, haloperidol, Lactated Ringer s, lidocaine HCl, metoclopramide, morphine, 
norepinephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam (EDTA formulation), potassium chloride, propofol, ranitidine 
HCl, theophylline, and tobramycin. </p>
<p>Tigecycline Accord must not be mixed with other medicinal products for which compatibility data are 
not available. </p>
<p>Reconstituted solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 6 hours at 
20-25  C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would 
not be longer than the times stated above for the chemical and physical in-use stability. </p>
<p>Diluted solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 
20-25  C and 48 hours at 2-8  C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would not be longer than the times stated above for the chemical and 
physical in-use stability.  </p>
<p>For single use only, any unused solution should be discarded. </p>         </div>"""
