<p>Tivicay is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults, adolescents and children 
of at least 6 years of age or older, and who weigh at least 14 kg. </p>
<p>Tivicay does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps it at a low level. 
As a result of that, it also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood 
cells that are important in helping your body to fight infection. </p>
<p>Not everyone responds to treatment with Tivicay in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the effectiveness 
of your treatment. </p>
<p>Tivicay is always used in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines (combination therapy).<br />
To control your HIV infection, and to stop your illness from getting worse, you must keep taking all your 
medicines, unless your doctor tells you to stop taking any. </p>         </div>"""

used in multiple sclerosis). 
→ If you think any of these apply to you (or your child), tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Look out for important symptoms<br />
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. These 
include:<br />
* symptoms of infections and inflammation 
* joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you (or your child, if they are 
the patient) are taking Tivicay.<br />
→ Read the information in Section 4 of this leaflet.  </p>
<p>Children 
Do not give this medicine to children under 6 years of age, weighing less than 14 kg or with HIV infection 
that is resistant to other medicines similar to Tivicay. The use of Tivicay film-coated tablets in children under 
6 or weighing less than 14 kg has not yet been studied. </p>
<p>Children must keep planned doctor’s appointments (see ‘Use in children and adolescents’ in Section 3 for 
more information). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tivicay 
Tell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking, have recently taken or are planning to take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Don't take Tivicay with the following medicine: 
* fampridine (also known as dalfampridine), used in multiple sclerosis. </p>
<p>Some medicines can affect how Tivicay works, or make it more likely that you will have side effects. 
Tivicay can also affect how some other medicines work.<br />
Tell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking any of the medicines in the following list: 
* metformin, to treat diabetes 
* medicines called antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn. Do not take an antacid during the 6 
hours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it. (See also Section 3). 
* calcium supplements, iron supplements and multivitamins.  Do not take a calcium supplement, 
iron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours 
after you take it (see also Section 3). 
* etravirine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or tipranavir/ritonavir, to treat HIV 
infection 
* rifampicin, to treat tuberculosis (TB) and other bacterial infections 
* phenytoin and phenobarbital, to treat epilepsy 
* oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine, to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder 
* St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy to treat depression </p>
<p>→ Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) are taking any of these. Your doctor may 
decide to adjust your dose or that you need extra check ups. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby:  </p>
<p>→ Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Tivicay.  </p>
<p>Taking Tivicay at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may increase the 
risk of a type of birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed spinal cord). 
If you could get pregnant while receiving Tivicay: </p>
<p>→ Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom or pills. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will 
review your treatment. Do not stop taking Tivicay without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and 
your unborn child. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to 
the baby in breast milk.  </p>
<p>A small amount of the ingredient in Tivicay can pass into your breast milk.  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon 
as possible.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Tivicay can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. </p>
<p>→ Don’t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure you’re not affected.  </p>
<p>Tivicay contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say is essentially ‘sodium-free.’ </p>         </div>"""

<p>Swallow the tablet(s) with some liquid.  </p>
<p>Tivicay can be taken with or without food. When Tivicay is taken twice a day, your doctor may advise you 
to take with food.  </p>
<p>Tivicay is also available as dispersible tablets. Film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets are not the same, 
therefore do not switch between film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets without first talking to your 
doctor.  </p>
<p>Use in children and adolescents 
* Children’s dose of Tivicay needs to be adjusted as they get older or gain weight. </p>
<p>→ It is important therefore that children keep planned doctor’s appointments. 
* Children and adolescents weighing at least 20 kg can take the adult dose of 50 mg, once a day or mg twice daily. Your doctor will decide how Tivicay should be given. 
* For children aged between 6 and 12 years your doctor will decide on the correct dose of Tivicay, 
depending on the weight of your child.<br />
* To reduce the risk of choking, children must not swallow more than one tablet at a time. 
* Tivicay should not be used in children and adolescents with HIV infection that is resistant to other 
medicines similar to Tivicay. </p>
<p>Antacid medicines 
Antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn, can stop Tivicay being absorbed into your body and make it 
less effective. 
Do not take an antacid during the 6 hours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it.<br />
Other acid-lowering medicines like ranitidine and omeprazole can be taken at the same time as Tivicay.   </p>
<p>→ Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking acid-lowering medicines with Tivicay. </p>
<p>Calcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins 
Calcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins can stop Tivicay being absorbed into your body 
and make it less effective. 
Do not take a calcium supplement, iron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take 
Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it.   </p>
<p>→ Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking calcium supplements, iron supplements or 
multivitamins with Tivicay. </p>
<p>If you take more Tivicay than you should<br />
If you (or your child) take too many tablets of Tivicay, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. If 
possible, show them the Tivicay pack. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Tivicay<br />
If you (or your child) miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.  But if your next dose is due within 4 
hours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your treatment as 
before.  </p>
<p>Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. </p>
<p>Don’t stop taking Tivicay without advice from your doctor<br />
Take Tivicay for as long as your doctor recommends.  Don’t stop unless your doctor advises you to.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before. </li>
</ul>
<p>Rare side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: 
• liver failure (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes or unusually dark 
urine) 
• increase in bilirubin (a test of liver function) in your blood. 
• suicide (particularly in in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before) </p>
<p>→  Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any mental health problems (see also other mental 
health problems above). </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation<br />
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop 
serious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been “silent” and not detected by the 
weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes 
stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. Symptoms 
usually include fever, plus some of the following: 
• headache 
• stomach ache 
• difficulty breathing 
In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune 
disorders).  The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking 
medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
• palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
• hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)<br />
• weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. </p>
<p>If you (or your child) get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the 
symptoms above: </p>
<p>→ Tell your doctor immediately. Don’t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor’s 
advice. </p>
<p>Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more 
likely to get this condition: 
• if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
• if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
• if they drink alcohol 
• if their immune systems are very weak 
• if they are overweight. 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
• stiffness in the joints 
• aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
• difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: </p>
<p>→ Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects<br />
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is 
partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor 
will test for these changes.  </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed 
in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix 
V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
