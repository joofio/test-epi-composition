  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tolvaptan Accord, which contains the active substance tolvaptan, belongs to a group of medicines 
called vasopressin antagonists. Vasopressin is a hormone that helps prevent the loss of water from the 
body by reducing urine output. Antagonist means that it prevents vasopressin having its effect on 
water retention. This leads to a reduction in the amount of water in the body by increasing urine 
production and as a result it increases the level or concentration of sodium in your blood. </p>
<p>Tolvaptan Accord is used to treat low serum sodium levels in adults. You have been prescribed this 
medicine because you have a lowered sodium level in your blood as a result of a disease called 
 syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion  (SIADH) where the kidneys retain too 
much water. This disease causes an inappropriate production of the hormone vasopressin which has 
caused the sodium levels in your blood to get too low (hyponatremia). That can lead to difficulties in 
concentration and memory, or in keeping your balance. </p>         </div>"""

section 6) or if you are allergic to benzazepine or benzazepine derivatives (e.g., benazepril, 
conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine)

* if you suffer from a kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
(ADPKD) 
* if you have diabetes. </p>
<p>Drinking enough water 
Tolvaptan Accord causes water loss because it increases your urine production. This water loss may 
result in side effects such as dry mouth and thirst or even more severe side effects like kidney 
problems (see Section 4). It is therefore important that you have access to water and that you are able 
to drink sufficient amounts when you feel thirsty. </p>
