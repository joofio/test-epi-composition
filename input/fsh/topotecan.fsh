<p>Serious side effects: tell your doctor </p>
<p>These very common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Topotecan 
Hospira:<br />
* Signs of infection: Topotecan may reduce the number of white blood cells and lower your 
resistance to infection. This can even be life threatening. Signs include: 
 
fever 
 
serious deterioration of your general condition 
 
local symptoms such as sore throat or urinary problems (for example, a burning sensation 
when urinating, which may be a urinary infection). </p>
<p> 
Occasionally severe stomach pain, fever and possibly diarrhoea (rarely with blood) can be signs 
of bowel inflammation (colitis)  </p>
<p>This rare side effect may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Topotecan Hospira: 
 
Lung inflammation (interstitial lung disease): You are most at risk if you have existing lung 
disease, have had radiation treatment to your lungs, or have previously taken medicines that 
caused lung damage. Signs include: 
 
difficulty breathing 
 
cough 
 
fever </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you get any symptoms of these conditions, as hospitalisation may be 
necessary. </p>
<p>Very common side effects<br />
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Topotecan Hospira: 
 
Feeling generally weak and tired (temporary anaemia). In some cases you may need a blood 
transfusion. 
 
Unusual bruising or bleeding, caused by a decrease in the number of clotting cells in the blood. 
This can lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. Rarely, it can 
lead to more severe bleeding (haemorrhage). Talk to your doctor for advice on how to minimise 
the risk of bleeding. 
 
Weight loss and loss of appetite (anorexia); tiredness; weakness. 
 
Feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting); diarrhoea; stomach pain; constipation.

These may affect up to 1 in 10 people treated with Topotecan Hospira: 
 
Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (including rash). 
 
Yellow skin. 
 
Feeling unwell. 
 
Itching sensation. </p>
<p>Rare side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Topotecan Hospira: 
 
Severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions. 
 
Swelling caused by fluid build-up (angioedema). 
 
Mild pain and inflammation at the site of injection.

gastrointestinal perforation).  </p>
<p> 
Mouth sores, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloody stools 
(possible signs and symptoms of inflammation of the inner lining of the mouth, stomach and/or 
gut [mucosal inflammation]).  </p>
<p>If you are being treated for cervical cancer, you may get side effects from the other medicine 
(cisplatin) that you will be given along with Topotecan Hospira. Those effects are described in the 
cisplatin patient leaflet.  </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects

order to protect from light. </p>

Refer to the SmPC for full details. </p>
<p>Topotecan Hospira 4 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires dilution to a final 
concentration of 25-50 micrograms/ml, prior to administration to the patient. The approved diluents 
for the concentrate are sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection and glucose 50 mg/ml 
(5%) solution for injection. Use the aseptic technique during any further dilution of the solution for 
infusion.  </p>
<p>Parenteral products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. Topotecan Hospira is a yellow/yellow green solution.  </p>
<p>Prior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil count 
of ≥1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of ≥100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if 
necessary).  Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia should be managed. For further details, refer to the 
SPC. </p>
<p>Dosage: Ovarian and Small Cell Lung Carcinoma<br />
Initial dose: 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area/day, administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes 
for 5 consecutive days, with a 3 week interval between the start of each course.  </p>
<p>Subsequent doses: Topotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥1 x 109/l, 
the platelet count is ≥100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary).  </p>
<p>Dosage: Cervical Carcinoma 
Initial dose: 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as 30 minute intravenous infusion daily, on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 at a dose of 50 mg/m2/day and following 
the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is repeated every 21 days for 6 courses or until 
progressive disease. </p>
<p>Subsequent doses: Topotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥1.5 x 109/l, 
the platelet count is ≥100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary).  </p>
<p>Dosage: Renally impaired patients 
Limited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Please refer to the SPC for further details. </p>
<p>Dosage: Paediatric population 
Limited data available.  Use not recommended. </p>
<p>Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25°C under normal light 
conditions and at 2°C-8°C when protected from light. From a microbiological point of view, the 
product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions 
prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 
2°C to 8°C, unless reconstitution/dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions. </p>
