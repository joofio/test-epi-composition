  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tracleer tablets contain bosentan, which blocks a naturally occurring hormone called endothelin-1 
(ET-1), which causes blood vessels to narrow. Tracleer therefore causes blood vessels to expand and 
belongs to the class of medicines called  endothelin receptor antagonists .
Tracleer is used to treat:</p>
<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): PAH is a disease of severe narrowing of the blood 
vessels in the lungs resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary 
arteries) that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. This pressure reduces the amount of 
oxygen that can get into the blood in the lungs, making physical activity more difficult. Tracleer 
widens the pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. This 
lowers the blood pressure and relieves the symptoms.
Tracleer is used to treat patients with class III PAH to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry 
out physical activity) and symptoms. The  class  reflects the seriousness of the disease:  class III<br />
involves marked limitation of physical activity. Some improvements have also been shown in patients 
with class II PAH.  Class II  involves slight limitation of physical activity. The PAH for which 
Tracleer is indicated can be:</p>
<p>primary (with no identified cause or familial);</p>
<p>caused by scleroderma (also called systemic sclerosis, a disease where there is abnormal growth 
of the connective tissue that supports the skin and other organs);</p>
<p>caused by congenital (inborn) heart defects with shunts (abnormal passageways) causing 
abnormal flow of blood through the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Digital ulcers: (sores on the fingers and toes) in adult patients with a condition called 
scleroderma. Tracleer reduces the number of new finger and toe ulcers that appear.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Tests your doctor will do before treatment</p>
<p>a blood test to check your liver function</p>
<p>a blood test to check for anaemia (low haemoglobin)</p>
<p>a pregnancy test if you are a woman of childbearing potential
Some patients taking Tracleer have been found to have abnormal liver function tests and anaemia (low 
haemoglobin).
Tests your doctor will do during treatment
During treatment with Tracleer, your doctor will arrange for regular blood tests to check for changes in 
your liver function and haemoglobin level.
For all these tests please refer also to the Patient Alert Card (inside your pack of Tracleer tablets). It is 
important that you have these regular blood tests as long as you are taking Tracleer. We suggest you 
write the date of your most recent test and also of your next test (ask your doctor for the date) on the 
Patient Alert Card, to help you remember when your next test is due.
Blood tests for liver function
These will be done every month for the duration of treatment with Tracleer. After an increase in dose 
an additional test will be done after 2 weeks.
Blood tests for anaemia
These will be done every month for the first 4 months of treatment, then every 3 months after that, as 
patients taking Tracleer may get anaemia.
If these results are abnormal, your doctor may decide to reduce your dose or stop treatment with 
Tracleer and to perform further tests to investigate the cause.
Children and adolescents
Tracleer is not recommended in paediatric patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer
disease. Please see also section </p>         </div>"""

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. It is especially important to tell your doctor if 
you are taking:</p>
<p>cyclosporine A (a medicine used after transplants and to treat psoriasis), which must not be used
together with Tracleer.</p>
<p>sirolimus or tacrolimus, which are medicines used after transplants, as these are not 
recommended to be used together with Tracleer.</p>
<p>glibenclamide (a diabetes medicine), rifampicin (a tuberculosis medicine), fluconazole (a 
medicine against fungal infections), ketoconazole (a medicine used to treat Cushing s 
syndrome), or nevirapine (an HIV medicine), as these medicines are not recommended to be 
used together with Tracleer.</p>
<p>other medicines for the treatment of HIV infection, which may require special monitoring if 
used together with Tracleer.</p>
<p>hormonal contraceptives, which are not effective as the sole method of contraception when you 
take Tracleer. Inside your pack of Tracleer tablets you will find a Patient Alert Card which you 
should read carefully. Your doctor and/or gynaecologist will establish the contraception which 
is appropriate for you.</p>
<p>other medications for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension: sildenafil and tadalafil;</p>
<p>warfarin (an anticoagulant agent);</p>
<p>simvastatin (used to treat hypercholesterolaemia).
Driving and using machines
Tracleer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, Tracleer 
can induce hypotension (decrease of your blood pressure) which can make you feel dizzy, affect your 
vision and affect your ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, if you feel dizzy or that your 
vision is blurred while taking Tracleer, do not drive or operate any tools or machines.
Women of childbearing age
Do NOT take Tracleer if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Pregnancy tests
Tracleer may harm unborn babies conceived before starting or during treatment. If you are a woman 
who could become pregnant, your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start taking 
Tracleer, and regularly while you are taking Tracleer.
Contraceptives
If it is possible that you could become pregnant, use a reliable form of birth control (contraception) 
while you are taking Tracleer. Your doctor or gynaecologist will advise you about reliable 
contraceptive methods while taking Tracleer. Because Tracleer may make hormonal contraception 
(e.g., oral, injection, implant, or skin patches) ineffective, this method on its own is not reliable. 
Therefore, if you use hormonal contraceptives you must also use a barrier method (e.g., female 
condom, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, or your partner must also use a condom). Inside your pack 
of Tracleer tablets you will find a Patient Alert Card. You should complete this card and take it to your 
doctor at your next visit so that your doctor or gynaecologist can assess whether you need additional 
or alternative reliable contraceptive methods. Monthly pregnancy tests are recommended while you 
are taking Tracleer and are of childbearing age.
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking Tracleer, or plan to become 
pregnant in the near future.
Breast-feeding
Tell your doctor immediately if you are breast-feeding. You are advised to stop breast-feeding if 
Tracleer is prescribed for you, because it is not known whether this medicine passes into breast milk.
Fertility
If you are a man taking Tracleer, it is possible that this medicine may lower your sperm count. It 
cannot be excluded that this may affect your ability to father a child. Talk to your doctor if you have 
any questions or concerns about this.
Tracleer contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Tracleer with food and drink
Tracleer can be taken with or without food.
Recommended dose
Adult
The treatment in adults is usually started for the first 4 weeks with 62.5 mg twice daily (morning and 
evening), from then your doctor will usually advise you to take a 125 mg tablet twice daily, depending 
on how you react to Tracleer.
Children and adolescents
The dose recommendation in children is only for PAH. For children aged 1 year and older, treatment 
with Tracleer is usually started with 2 mg per kg bodyweight twice daily (morning and evening). Your 
doctor will advise you on your dosing.
Please note that Tracleer is also available as a dispersible 32 mg tablet formulation, which may make 
correct dosing easier for children and patients with low body weight or difficulties to swallow film-
coated tablets.
If you have the impression that the effect of Tracleer is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor in 
order to find out whether your dose needs to be changed.
How to take Tracleer
Tablets should be taken (morning and evening), swallowed with water. The tablets can be taken with 
or without food.
If you take more Tracleer than you should
If you take more tablets than you have been told to take, contact your doctor immediately.
If you forget to take Tracleer
If you forget to take Tracleer, take a dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your tablets 
at the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten tablets.
If you stop taking Tracleer
Suddenly stopping your treatment with Tracleer may lead to your symptoms getting worse. Do not 
stop taking Tracleer unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to reduce the dose over a 
few days before stopping completely.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
