used in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy.  </p>
<p>Tractocile works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) less strong. It also makes the 
contractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body called 
“oxytocin” which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. 
- if you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. 
- if your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed 30 weeks 
of your pregnancy or more. 
- if your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. 
- if you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered 
straight away.<br />
- if you have something called “severe pre-eclampsia” and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be 
delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, fluid 
retention and/or protein in your urine. 
- if you have something called “eclampsia” which is similar to “severe pre-eclampsia” but you would 
also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered straight away. 
- if your unborn baby has died. 
- if you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). 
- if your placenta is covering the birth canal. 
- if your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. 
- if you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue with 
your pregnancy. 
- if you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Do not use Tractocile if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, midwife or 
pharmacist before you are given Tractocile. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Tractocile: 
- if you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). 
- if you have kidney or liver problems. 
- if you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. 
- if you are pregnant with more than one baby. 
- if your contractions start again, treatment with Tractocile can be repeated up to three more times. 
- if your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. 
- Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause bleeding. 
- if you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth of 
your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung oedema 
(accumulation of fluid in the lungs). </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you 
are given Tractocile. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Tractocile has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tractocile 
Tell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are given 
Tractocile. </p>         </div>"""
