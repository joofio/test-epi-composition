body reduce the level of sugar in your blood.
Trajenta is used for  type 2 diabetes  in adults, if the disease cannot be adequately controlled with one 
oral anti-diabetic medicine (metformin or sulphonylureas) or diet and exercise alone. Trajenta may be 
used together with other anti-diabetic medicines e.g. metformin, sulphonylureas (e.g. glimepiride, 
glipizide), empagliflozin, or insulin.
It is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise that you have been given by your
doctor or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Trajenta if you:</p>
<p>have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a
complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting). Trajenta
should not be used to treat these conditions.</p>
<p>are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a  sulphonylurea  (e.g. glimepiride, glipizide), 
your doctor may want to reduce your dose of sulphonylurea when you take it together with 
Trajenta in order to avoid your blood sugar going too low.</p>
<p>have had allergic reactions to any other medicines that you take to control the amount of sugar 
in your blood.</p>
<p>have or have had a disease of the pancreas.
If you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, like persistent, severe stomach ache (abdominal pain), you 
should consult your doctor.
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. 
Your doctor may ask you to stop Trajenta.
Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse.
Children and adolescents
Trajenta is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. It is not effective in children 
and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and 
effective when used in children younger than 10 years.
Other medicines and Trajenta
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following 
active substances:</p>
<p>Carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. These may be used to control fits (seizures) or 
chronic pain.</p>
<p>Rifampicin. This is an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is unknown if Trajenta is harmful to the unborn child. Therefore, it is preferable to avoid using
Trajenta if you are pregnant.
It is not known if Trajenta passes into human breast milk. A decision must be made by your doctor 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Trajenta therapy.
Driving and using machines
Trajenta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Taking Trajenta in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas and/or insulin can cause too low 
blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work 
without safe foothold. However, more frequent blood glucose testing might be recommended to 
minimise the risk for hypoglycaemia, especially when Trajenta is combined with sulphonylurea and/or 
insulin.</p>         </div>"""
