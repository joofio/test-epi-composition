bone marrow cells which leads to the production of healthy blood cells. </p>

 
if you are allergic to treosulfan, 
 
if you suffer from an active uncontrolled infection, 
 
if you suffer from severe heart, lung, liver or kidney diseases, 
 
if you suffer from hereditary DNA repair disorder, a condition that reduces the ability to repair 
DNA (which carries your genetic information), 
 
if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Trecondi is a cell-killing (cytotoxic) medicine that is used to decrease the number of blood cells. At 
the recommended dose, this is the desired effect. You will have regular blood tests during treatment to 
check your blood cell counts do not fall too low. </p>
<p>In order to prevent and treat infections, you will be given medicines, such as antibiotics, antifungals or 
antivirals. </p>
<p>Trecondi may increase the risk of having another cancer in the future. </p>
<p>Since inflammation of the oral mucosa is a common side effect of this medicine, you should pay 
attention to adequate oral hygiene. Preventive measures such as the use of mouthwashes (e.g. with 
barrier protectants, antimicrobials) or application of ice within the oral cavity (lessens blood flow to 
the oral mucosa and reduces the amount of treosulfan reaching the cell) is recommended.  </p>
<p>You must not receive live vaccines during treatment with treosulfan. </p>
<p>Trecondi may cause symptoms of the menopause (absence of menstrual periods).  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Fits (seizures) may occur very rarely in infants of less than 4 months of age. Children younger than 
1 year may have more severe side effects that affect breathing than older ones. Your child will be 
monitored for signs of side effects affecting nerves and breathing problems.  </p>
<p>Nappy rash with sores of the area around the anus (perianal) may occur in infants, toddlers and 
children wearing nappies because treosulfan passed out in the urine can damage the skin. Therefore, 
nappies should be changed frequently during 6–8 hours after each dose of this medicine.  </p>
<p>There is not sufficient information on the use of treosulfan in children aged less than 1 month. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Trecondi 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You must not get pregnant during treatment with this medicine and up to 6 months after treatment. 
Use an effective method of contraception when either you or your partner is receiving this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. </p>
<p>You should stop breast-feeding before starting treatment with this medicine. </p>
<p>If you are a man treated with this medicine, you should not father a child during and up to 6 months 
after treatment.  </p>
<p>This medicine may make you infertile and it may not be possible for you to get pregnant after 
treatment with it. If you are concerned about having children, you should discuss this with your doctor 
before treatment. Men should seek advice about the possibility of sperm preservation before starting 
therapy. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine can cause nausea, vomiting and dizziness which may reduce your ability to drive or use 
machines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""
