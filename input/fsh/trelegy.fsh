  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Trelegy Ellipta is </p>
<p>Trelegy Ellipta contains three active substances called fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and 
vilanterol. Fluticasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids, often simply called 
steroids. Umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. </p>
<p>What Trelegy Ellipta is used for </p>
<p>Trelegy Ellipta is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a long-
term condition characterised by breathing difficulties that slowly get worse.  </p>
<p>In COPD the muscles around the airways tighten, making breathing difficult. This medicine widens these 
muscles in the lungs, reducing the swelling and irritation in the small air passages and making it easier for air 
to get in and out of the lungs. When used regularly, it can help to control your breathing difficulties and 
reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.  </p>
<p>Trelegy Ellipta should be used every day and not only when you have breathing problems or 
other symptoms of COPD. It should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or 
wheezing. If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting inhaler (such as salbutamol). If 
you do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor. </p>         </div>"""
