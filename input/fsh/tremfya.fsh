antibody.
This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, which is present at increased 
levels in people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
Plaque psoriasis
Tremfya is used to treat adults with moderate to severe  plaque psoriasis , an inflammatory condition 
affecting the skin and nails.
Tremfya can improve the condition of the skin and appearance of nails and reduce symptoms, such as 
scaling, shedding, flaking, itching, pain and burning.
Psoriatic arthritis
Tremfya is used to treat a condition called  psoriatic arthritis , an inflammatory disease of the joints, 
often accompanied by plaque psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines or in case of intolerance, you will be 
given Tremfya to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease. Tremfya can be used alone or with 
another medicine named methotrexate.
Using Tremfya in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the 
disease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to 
do normal daily activities.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to guselkumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using Tremfya.</p>
<p>if you have an active infection, including active tuberculosis.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tremfya:</p>
<p>if you are being treated for an infection;</p>
<p>if you have an infection that does not go away or that keeps coming back;</p>
<p>if you have tuberculosis or have been in close contact with someone with tuberculosis;</p>
<p>if you think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection (see below under  Look out 
for infections and allergic reactions );</p>
<p>if you have recently had a vaccination or if you are due to have a vaccination during treatment 
with Tremfya.
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using Tremfya.
As directed by your doctor, you may need blood tests to check if you have high levels of liver 
enzymes before you start taking Tremfya and when using it. Increases in liver enzymes may occur 
more frequently in patients receiving Tremfya every 4 weeks than in patients receiving Tremfya every 
8 weeks (see  How to use Tremfya  in section 3).
Look out for infections and allergic reactions
Tremfya can potentially cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions and infections. You 
must look out for signs of these conditions while you are taking Tremfya. 
Signs of infections may include fever or flu like symptoms; muscle aches; cough; shortness of breath; 
burning when you urinate or urinating more often than usual; blood in your phlegm (mucus); weight 
loss; diarrhoea or stomach pain; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body which are different 
from your psoriasis.
Serious allergic reactions, which can include the following symptoms, swollen face, lips, mouth, 
tongue or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing and hives, have occurred with Tremfya (see 
 Serious side effects  in section 4).
Stop using Tremfya and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs 
indicating a possible serious allergic reaction or an infection.
Children and adolescents
Tremfya is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group.
Other medicines and Tremfya
Tell your doctor or pharmacist:</p>
<p>if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.</p>
<p>if you recently had or are due to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of 
vaccines (live vaccines) while using Tremfya.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>Tremfya should not be used in pregnancy as the effects of this medicine in pregnant women are 
not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Tremfya and for at least 12 weeks
after the last Tremfya dose. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant 
or are planning to have a baby.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed. You and your doctor 
should decide if you will breast-feed or use Tremfya.
Driving and using machines
Tremfya is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines.</p>         </div>"""

Tremfya. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about giving yourself an injection. It 
is important not to try to inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or nurse.
