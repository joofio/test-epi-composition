leukaemias.  </p>
<p>You must not receive TRISENOX 
If you are allergic to arsenic trioxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
You must talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given TRISENOX, if 
- you have impaired kidney function. 
- you have any liver problems. </p>
<p>Your doctor will take the following precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests will be performed to check the amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium and creatinine 
in your blood before your first dose of TRISENOX.  </li>
<li>You should have an electrical recording of the heart (electrocardiogram ECG) performed before 
your first dose.  </li>
<li>Blood tests (potassium, calcium, magnesium and liver function) should be repeated during your 
treatment with TRISENOX.  </li>
<li>In addition, you will receive electrocardiograms twice weekly.  </li>
<li>If you are at risk for a certain type of abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. torsade de pointes or QTc 
prolongation), your heart will be monitored continuously.  </li>
<li>Your doctor may monitor your health during and after treatment, since arsenic trioxide, the 
active substance in TRISENOX, may cause other cancers. You should report any new and 
exceptional symptoms and circumstances whenever you see your doctor. </li>
<li>Follow-up of your cognitive and mobility functions if you are at risk for vitamin B1 deficiency. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
TRISENOX is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and TRISENOX 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>In particular tell your doctor<br />
- if you are taking any of various types of medicines which could cause a change in the rhythm of 
your heartbeat. These include:<br />
<em> some types of antiarrhythmics (medicines used to correct irregular heart beats, e.g. 
quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide)<br />
</em> medicines to treat psychosis (loss of contact with reality, e.g. thioridazine)<br />
<em> medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline)<br />
</em> some types of medicines to treat bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin and sparfloxacin) 
* some medicines to treat allergies such as hay fever, called antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine 
and astemizole) 
* any medicines that cause a decrease in magnesium or potassium in your blood (e.g. 
amphotericin B) 
* cisapride (a medicine used to relieve certain stomach problems).<br />
The effect of these medicines on your heartbeat can be made worse by TRISENOX. You must 
be sure to tell your doctor about all medicines you are taking. 
- if you are taking or have recently taken any medicine which may affect your liver. If you are not 
sure, show the bottle or pack to your doctor. </p>
<p>TRISENOX with food and drink 
There are no restrictions on your food or drink while you are receiving TRISENOX. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  </p>
<p>TRISENOX may cause harm to the foetus when used by pregnant women.  </p>
<p>If you are able to become pregnant, you must use effective birth control during treatment with 
TRISENOX and for 6 months following completion of treatment.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or you become pregnant during the treatment with TRISENOX, you must ask your 
doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Men should also use effective contraception and be advised to not father a child while receiving 
TRISENOX and for 3 months following completion of treatment. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.<br />
The arsenic in TRISENOX passes into breast milk.<br />
Because TRISENOX can harm nursing infants, do not breast-feed while on and until two weeks after 
the last dose of TRISENOX. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
TRISENOX is expected to have no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. 
If you experience discomfort or if you feel unwell after a TRISENOX injection, you should wait until 
the symptoms go away before driving or using machines. </p>
<p>TRISENOX contains sodium 
TRISENOX contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
