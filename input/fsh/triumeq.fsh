  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Triumeq is a medicine that contains three active substances used to treat HIV infection: abacavir, 
lamivudine and dolutegravir. Abacavir and lamivudine belong to a group of anti-retroviral medicines 
(medicines used to treat HIV infection) called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NRTIs), and dolutegravir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called integrase inhibitors 
(INIs). </p>
<p>Triumeq is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults, adolescents and 
children   who weigh at least 25 kg. </p>
<p>Before you are prescribed Triumeq your doctor will arrange a test to find out whether you carry a 
particular type of gene called HLA-B<em>5701. Triumeq should not be used in patients who are known to 
carry the HLA-B</em>5701 gene. Patients with this gene are at a high risk of developing a serious 
hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction if they use Triumeq (see  hypersensitivity reactions  in section 4). </p>
<p>Triumeq does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps it at a 
low level. It also increases the number of CD4 cells in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood 
cells that are important in helping your body to fight infection. </p>
<p>Not everyone responds to treatment with Triumeq in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the 
effectiveness of your treatment. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
IMPORTANT   Hypersensitivity reactions 
Triumeq contains abacavir and dolutegravir. Both of these active substances can cause a serious 
allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. You should never take abacavir or abacavir-
containing products again if you have a hypersensitivity reaction: it can be life threatening. </p>
<p>You must carefully read all the information under  Hypersensitivity reactions  in the panel in 
Section 4. The Triumeq pack includes an Alert Card to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity. 
Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. </p>
<p>Take special care with Triumeq  </p>
<p>Some people taking Triumeq or other combination treatments for HIV are more at risk of serious side 
effects than others. You need to be aware of the extra risks: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you have moderate or severe liver disease </li>
<li>if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B infection, 
don t stop Triumeq without your doctor s advice, as your hepatitis may come back)  </li>
<li>if you have a kidney problem 
  Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you before using Triumeq. You may need 
extra check-ups, including blood tests, while you re taking your medicine. See Section 4 for more 
information.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions 
Even patients who don t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a 
serious allergic reaction). 
  Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4 of this 
leaflet. </p>
<p>Risk of cardiovascular events 
It cannot be excluded that abacavir may increase the risk of having cardiovascular events. 
  Tell your doctor if you have cardiovascular problems, if you smoke, or have other illnesses 
that may increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes. 
Don t stop taking Triumeq unless your doctor advises you to do so. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms<br />
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. 
These include:<br />
* symptoms of infections and inflammation 
* joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you re taking Triumeq.<br />
  Read the information  Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV  in 
Section 4 of this leaflet.  </p>
<p>Children 
This medicine is not for children weighing less than 25 kg because the dose of each component of this 
medicine cannot be adjusted to their weight.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Triumeq 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Don't take Triumeq with the following medicine: 
* fampridine (also known as dalfampridine), used in multiple sclerosis. </p>
<p>Some medicines can affect how Triumeq works, or make it more likely that you will have side effects.<br />
Triumeq can also affect how some other medicines work.<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines in the following list: 
* metformin, to treat diabetes 
* medicines called antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn. Do not take an antacid 
during the 6 hours before you take Triumeq, or for at least 2 hours after you take it. (See also 
Section 3). 
* supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium. If you take Triumeq 
with food, you can take supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium 
at the same time as Triumeq. If you do not take Triumeq with food, do not take 
supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium during the 6 hours 
before you take Triumeq, or for at least 2 hours after you take it (see also Section 3). 
* emtricitabine, etravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine or tipranavir/ritonavir, to treat HIV infection 
* medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, 
mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly 
* other medicines containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection or hepatitis B infection 
* cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia 
* rifampicin, to treat tuberculosis (TB) and other bacterial infections 
* trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic to treat bacterial infections 
* phenytoin and phenobarbital, to treat epilepsy 
* oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine, to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder 
* St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy to treat depression 
* methadone, used as a heroin substitute.  Abacavir increases the rate at which methadone is 
removed from the body. If you are taking methadone, you will be checked for any withdrawal 
symptoms. Your methadone dose may need to be changed 
* Riociguat, used to treat high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) 
that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. Your doctor may need to reduce your riociguat 
dose, as abacavir may increase riociguat blood levels. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your doctor may decide to 
adjust your dose or that you need extra checkups. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby:  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Triumeq.  </p>
<p>Taking Triumeq at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may 
increase the risk of a type of birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed 
spinal cord).  </p>
<p>If you could get pregnant while receiving Triumeq:  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom 
or pills.  </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your 
doctor will review your treatment. Do not stop taking Triumeq without consulting your doctor, as this 
may harm you and your unborn child.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>A small amount of the ingredients in Triumeq can also pass into your breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Triumeq can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. </p>
<p>Don t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure your alertness has not been affected.  </p>
<p>Triumeq contains sodium. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

Children and adolescents weighing at least 25 kg can take the adult dose of one tablet once a day. 
If you weigh less than 25 kg, you cannot take Triumeq film-coated tablets, because the dose of each 
component of this medicine cannot be adjusted to your weight. Your doctor should  prescribe Triumeq 
dispersible tablets or the components separately for you.  </p>
<p>Triumeq is available as film-coated and dispersible tablets. Film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets 
are not the same. Therefore, you should not switch between film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets 
without first talking to your doctor. </p>
<p>Do not take an antacid during the 6 hours before you take Triumeq, or for at least 2 hours after you 
take it.  Other acid-lowering medicines like ranitidine and omeprazole can be taken at the same time as

<p>If you have stopped taking Triumeq 
If you have stopped taking Triumeq for any reason   especially because you think you are having 
side effects, or because you have another illness: 
Talk to your doctor before you start taking it again. Your doctor will check whether your 
symptoms were related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may be related to a 
hypersensitivity reaction, you will be told never again to take Triumeq, or any other medicine 
containing abacavir or dolutegravir. It is important that you follow this advice. 
If your doctor advises that you can start taking Triumeq again, you may be asked to take your first 
doses in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  </p>
<p>When you re being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of 
Triumeq or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV disease itself. So it is very 
important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. </p>
<p>Abacavir can cause a hypersensitivity reaction (a serious allergic reaction), especially in people 
who carry a particular type of gene called HLA-B<em>5701. Even patients who don t have the HLA-
B</em>5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction, described in this leaflet in the panel 
headed  Hypersensitivity reactions . It is very important that you read and understand the 
information about this serious reaction. </p>
<p>As well as the side effects listed below for Triumeq, other conditions can develop during 
combination therapy for HIV.<br />
It is important to read the information in this section under the heading  Other possible side effects 
of combination therapy for HIV . </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions  </p>
<p>Triumeq contains abacavir and dolutegravir. Both of these active substances can cause a serious 
allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction.  </p>
<p>These hypersensitivity reactions have been seen more frequently in people taking medicines that 
contain abacavir.  </p>
<p>Who gets these reactions? </p>
<p>Anyone taking Triumeq could develop a hypersensitivity reaction, which could be life threatening if 
they continue to take Triumeq. </p>
<p>You are more likely to develop this reaction if you have a gene called HLA-B*5701 (but you can get a 
reaction even if you don t have this gene). You should have been tested for this gene before Triumeq 
was prescribed for you. If you know you have this gene, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>What are the symptoms? </p>
<p>The most common symptoms are: 
fever (high temperature) and skin rash. 
Other common symptoms are: 
nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (stomach) pain, severe tiredness. </p>
<p>Other symptoms include: </p>
<p>pains in the joints or muscles, swelling of the neck, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough, occasional 
headaches, inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), mouth ulcers, low blood pressure, tingling or 
numbness of the hands or feet. </p>
<p>When do these reactions happen? </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions can start at any time during treatment with Triumeq, but are more likely 
during the first 6 weeks of treatment. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately: 
1 
if you get a skin rash, OR 
2 
if you get symptoms from at least 2 of the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fever  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shortness of breath, sore throat or cough </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>severe tiredness or aches and pains, or generally feeling ill. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may advise you to stop taking Triumeq. </p>
<p>If you have stopped taking Triumeq </p>
<p>If you have stopped taking Triumeq because of a hypersensitivity reaction, you must NEVER 
AGAIN take Triumeq, or any other medicine containing abacavir. If you do, within hours, your 
blood pressure could fall dangerously low, which could result in death. You should also never again 
take medicines containing dolutegravir. </p>
<p>If you have stopped taking Triumeq for any reason   especially because you think you are having 
side effects, or because you have other illness: </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before you start again. Your doctor will check whether your symptoms were 
related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been, you will then be told 
never again to take Triumeq, or any other medicine containing abacavir. You may also be told 
never again to take any other medicine containing dolutegravir. It is important that you follow this 
advice. </p>
<p>Occasionally, hypersensitivity reactions have developed in people who start taking abacavir containing 
products again, but who had only one symptom on the Alert Card before they stopped taking it. </p>
<p>Very rarely, patients who have taken medicines containing abacavir in the past without any symptoms 
of hypersensitivity have developed a hypersensitivity reaction when they start taking these medicines 
again.  </p>
<p>If your doctor advises that you can start taking Triumeq again, you may be asked to take your first 
doses in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. </p>
<p>If you are hypersensitive to Triumeq, return all your unused Triumeq tablets for safe disposal. Ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice. </p>
<p>The Triumeq pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity 
reactions. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. </p>

genitals (Stevens Johnson syndrome), and a more severe form causing skin peeling in more than 
30% of the body surface (toxic epidermal necrolysis) 
* lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood). </p>
<p>Very rare side effects that may show up in blood tests are:<br />
* a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia).  </p>
<p>If you get any side effects 
  Talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV 
Combination therapy such as Triumeq may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation<br />
People with advanced HIV infection or AIDS have weak immune systems, and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been  silent  and not 
detected by the weak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the 
immune system becomes stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of 
infection or inflammation. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: 
  headache 
  stomach ache 
  difficulty breathing 
In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue 
(autoimmune disorders).  The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after 
you start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
  palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
  hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)<br />
  weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the symptoms above: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately. Don t take other medicines for the infection without your 
doctor s advice. </p>
<p>Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. In this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
  if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
  if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
  if they drink alcohol 
  if their immune systems are very weak 
  if they are overweight. 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
  stiffness in the joints 
  aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
  difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects<br />
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your 
doctor will test for these changes.<br />
Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
