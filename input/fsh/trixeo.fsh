and budesonide.</p>
<p>Formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium belong to a group of medicines called 
 bronchodilators . They work in different ways to prevent tightening of the muscles around the 
airways, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs.</p>
<p>Budesonide belongs to a group of medicines called  corticosteroids . These work by reducing 
inflammation in your lungs.
Trixeo Aerosphere is an inhaler that is used for adults with a lung disease called  chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease  (or  COPD ), a long-term disease of the airways in the lungs.
Trixeo Aerosphere is used to make breathing easier and improve symptoms of COPD such as 
shortness of breath, wheezing and cough. Trixeo Aerosphere can also prevent flare-ups 
(exacerbations) of COPD.
Trixeo Aerosphere delivers the active substances into your lungs as you breathe in. If you use this 
medicine regularly twice a day, it will help to reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.</p>         </div>"""
