<p>Trizivir contains three active ingredients that are used to treat HIV infection: abacavir, lamivudine and 
zidovudine. All of these belong to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called nucleoside analogue 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). </p>
<p>Trizivir helps to control your condition. Trizivir does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of 
virus in your body and keeps it at a low level. This helps your body to increase the CD4 cell count in 
your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that are important in helping your body to fight 
infection. </p>

* if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to abacavir (or any other medicine containing abacavir 
— Kivexa, Triumeq or Ziagen), lamivudine or zidovudine, or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in Section 6) 
Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4. * if you have severe kidney problems

count (neutropenia) 
Check with your doctor if you think any of these apply to you. </p>
<p>Take special care with Trizivir 
Some people taking Trizivir are more at risk of serious side effects. You need to be aware of the extra 
risks: 
* if you have moderate or severe liver disease<br />
* if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B 
infection, do not stop Trizivir without your doctor’s advice, as your hepatitis may come 
back) 
* if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman) 
Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you before using Trizivir. 
You may need extra check-ups, including blood tests, while you are taking your medicine. See 
Section 4 for more information. </p>
<p>Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions 
Even patients who don’t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a 
serious allergic reaction).Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in 
Section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Risk of cardiovascular events 
It cannot be excluded that abacavir may increase the risk of having cardiovascular events. 
Tell your doctor if you have cardiovascular problems, if you smoke, or have other illnesses that 
may increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, or diabetes. Do 
not stop taking Trizivir unless your doctor advises you to do so. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking Trizivir develop other conditions, which can be serious. You need to know about 
important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Trizivir. 
Read the information ‘Other possible side effects of Trizivir’ in Section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Trizivir 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or if you have taken any 
recently, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.<br />
Remember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking 
Trizivir. </p>
<p>These medicines should not be used with Trizivir: 
* stavudine or emtricitabine, to treat HIV infection 
* other medicinal products containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection or hepatitis B 
infection 
* ribavirin or injections of ganciclovir to treat viral infections 
* high doses of co-trimoxazole, an antibiotic 
* cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia 
Tell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these. </p>
<p>Some medicines can make it more likely that you will have side effects, or make side 
effects worse<br />
These include: 
* sodium valproate, to treat epilepsy 
* interferon, to treat viral infections 
* pyrimethamine, to treat malaria and other parasitic infections 
* dapsone, to prevent pneumonia and treat skin infections 
* fluconazole or flucytosine, to treat fungal infections such as candida 
* pentamidine or atovaquone, to treat parasitic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia (often referred to as PCP)<br />
* amphotericin or co-trimoxazole, to treat fungal and bacterial infections 
* probenecid, to treat gout and similar conditions, and given with some antibiotics to make 
them more effective 
* methadone, used as a heroin substitute 
* vincristine, vinblastine or doxorubicin, to treat cancer 
Tell your doctor if you’re taking any of these. </p>
<p>Some medicines interact with Trizivir 
These include: 
* clarithromycin, an antibiotic 
If you are taking clarithromycin, take your dose at least 2 hours before or after you take your 
Trizivir. 
* phenytoin, for treating epilepsy 
Tell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin. Your doctor may need to monitor you while you 
are taking Trizivir </p>
<ul>
<li>medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, 
mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. </li>
<li>riociguat, for treating high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) 
that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. 
Your doctor may need to reduce your riociguat dose, as abacavir may increase riociguat blood 
levels.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Methadone and Trizivir 
Abacavir increases the rate at which methadone is removed from the body. If you are taking 
methadone, you will be checked for any withdrawal symptoms. Your methadone dose may need to 
be changed.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, if you become pregnant or if you are planning to become pregnant, talk to 
your doctor about the risks and benefits to you and your baby of taking Trizivir during your 
pregnancy.<br />
Trizivir and similar medicines may cause side effects in unborn babies.<br />
If you have taken Trizivir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and 
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took 
NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side 
effects.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. A small amount of the ingredients in Trizivir can also pass into your 
breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Trizivir can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. 
Don’t drive or operate machines unless you’re feeling well. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the other ingredients of Trizivir tablets. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially

medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  </p>
<p>Treatment with Trizivir often causes a loss of fat from legs, arms and face (lipoatrophy). This loss of 
body fat has been shown to be not fully reversible after discontinuation of zidovudine. Your doctor 
should monitor for signs of lipoatrophy. Tell your doctor if you notice any loss of fat from your legs, 
arms, and face. When these signs occur, Trizivir should be stopped and your HIV treatment changed. </p>
<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. </p>
<p>When you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of 
Trizivir or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV infection itself. So it is very 
important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. </p>
<p>Even patients who don’t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a 
serious allergic reaction), described in this leaflet in the panel headed ‘Hypersensitivity reactions’. 
It is very important that you read and understand the information about this serious reaction. </p>
<p>As well as the side effects listed below for Trizivir, other conditions can develop during treatment.<br />
It is important to read the information on the other side of this leaflet under ‘Other possible side 
effects of Trizivir’. </p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions 
Trizivir contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in Kivexa, Triumeq and Ziagen). 
Abacavir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. These 
hypersensitivity reactions have been seen more frequently in people taking medicines that contain 
abacavir.<br />
Who gets these reactions? 
Anyone taking Trizivir could develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which could be life 
threatening if they continue to take Trizivir. 
You are more likely to develop such a reaction if you have a gene called HLA-B*5701 (but you can 
get a reaction even if you do not have this gene). You should have been tested for this gene before 
Trizivir was prescribed for you. If you know you have this gene, tell your doctor before you take 
Trizivir. </p>
<p>About 3 to 4 in every 100 patients treated with abacavir in a clinical trial who did not have the HLA-
B*5701 gene developed a hypersensitivity reaction. </p>
<p>What are the symptoms? 
The most common symptoms are: 
* fever (high temperature) and skin rash 
Other common symptoms are: 
* nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (stomach) pain, severe tiredness 
Other symptoms include: 
Pains in the joints or muscles, swelling of the neck, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough, occasional 
headaches, inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), mouth ulcers, low blood pressure, tingling or 
numbness of the hands or feet. </p>
<p>When do these reactions happen? 
Hypersensitivity reactions can start at any time during treatment with Trizivir, but are more likely 
during the first 6 weeks of treatment. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately: 
1 
if you get a skin rash, OR 
2 
if you get symptoms from at least 2 of the following groups: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fever </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shortness of breath, sore throat or cough </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>severe tiredness or achiness, or generally feeling ill </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may advise you to stop taking Trizivir. </p>
<p>If you have stopped taking Trizivir 
      If you have stopped taking Trizivir because of a hypersensitivity reaction, you must NEVER 
AGAIN take Trizivir, or any other medicine containing abacavir (Kivexa, Triumeq or 
Ziagen). If you do, within hours, your blood pressure could fall dangerously low, which could 
result in death. </p>
<p>If you have stopped taking Trizivir for any reason — especially because you think you are having side 
effects, or because you have other illness: 
      Talk to your doctor before you start again. Your doctor will check whether your symptoms 
were related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been, you will then be 
told never again to take Trizivir, or any other medicine containing abacavir (Kivexa, Triumeq 
or Ziagen). It is important that you follow this advice. </p>
<p>Occasionally, hypersensitivity reactions have developed in people who start taking abacavir containing 
products again, but who had only one symptom on the Alert Card before they stopped taking it. </p>
<p>Very rarely, patients who have taken medicines containing abacavir in the past without any symptoms 
of hypersensitivity have developed a hypersensitivity reaction when they start taking these medicines 
again.  </p>
<p>If your doctor advises that you can start taking Trizivir again, you may be asked to take your first 
doses in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. </p>
<p>If you are hypersensitive to Trizivir, return all your unused Trizivir tablets for safe disposal. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. 
The Trizivir pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity 
reactions. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. </p>

notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other possible side effects of Trizivir 
Trizivir may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation  </p>
<p>Old infections may flare up 
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When these people start treatment, they may find 
that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. These symptoms are 
probably caused by the body’s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these 
infections. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: 
* headache 
* stomach ache 
* difficulty breathing </p>
<p>In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue 
(autoimmune disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you 
start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
* palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
* hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) 
* weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection while you’re taking Trizivir: 
Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your 
doctor’s advice. </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect 
Some people taking Trizivir develop a condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged liver.  </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the body. It is rare; if it happens, it usually 
develops after a few months of treatment. It can be life-threatening, causing failure of internal organs. </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis is more likely to develop in people who have liver disease, or in obese (very 
overweight) people, especially women. 
Signs of lactic acidosis include: 
* feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) 
* stomach pain 
* generally feeling unwell 
* loss of appetite, weight loss 
* deep, rapid, difficult breathing 
* numbness or weakness in the limbs 
During your treatment, your doctor will monitor you for signs of lactic acidosis. If you have any of the 
symptoms listed above or any other symptoms that worry you: 
See your doctor as soon as possible. </p>
<p>You may have problems with your bones 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: </p>
<ul>
<li>if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time </li>
<li>if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids </li>
<li>if they drink alcohol </li>
<li>if their immune systems are very weak </li>
<li>if they are overweight 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: </li>
<li>stiffness in the joints </li>
<li>aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) </li>
<li>difficulty moving 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
Tell your doctor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other effects may show up in blood tests 
Trizivir can also cause: 
* increased levels of lactic acid in the blood, which on rare occasions can lead to lactic 
acidosis </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
