adults and children aged 10 years and above, with type 2 diabetes mellitus and can help prevent heart 
disease. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that<br />
your body produces does not work as well as it should.  </p>
<p>When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. </p>
<p>Trulicity is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>on its own if your blood sugar is not properly controlled by diet and exercise alone, and you 
can t take metformin (another diabetes medicine). </li>
<li>or with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar 
levels. These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by 
injection. </li>

pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to dulaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Trulicity if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are on dialysis as this medicine is not recommended. </li>
<li>you have type 1 diabetes (the type when your body does not produce any insulin) as this 
medicine may not be right for you. </li>
<li>you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable 
to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin). The signs include rapid weight 
loss, feeling sick or being sick, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your 
mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat. </li>
<li>you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer 
than normal (including gastroparesis). </li>
<li>you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) which causes severe pain in the 
stomach and back which does not go away. </li>
<li>you are taking a sulphonylurea or insulin for your diabetes, as low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these other 
medicines to reduce this risk. 
Trulicity is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. </li>
</ul>
<p>When initiating treatment with Trulicity, you may in some cases experience loss of 
fluids/dehydration, e.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea which may lead to a decrease in 
kidney function. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor 
if you have any questions or concerns. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Trulicity can be used in children and adolescents aged 10 years and above. Data is not available in 
children below 10 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Trulicity 
Because Trulicity can slow stomach emptying which could affect other medicines, tell your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
It is not known if dulaglutide could harm your unborn child. Women who could become pregnant 
should use contraception during treatment with dulagutide. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think 
you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, as Trulicity should not be used during 
pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. Do not use 
Trulicity if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if dulaglutide passes into human breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Trulicity has no to little effect on the ability to drive or use machines. However, if you use Trulicity in 
combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may 
reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any signs of low blood 
sugar. See section 2,  Warning and precautions  for information on increased risk of low blood sugar 
and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. </p>
<p>Trulicity contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. </p>
<p>Adults 
Your doctor may recommend a dose of 0.75 mg once a week for the treatment of your diabetes when 
Trulicity is used alone.  </p>
<p>When used with other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend a dose of 1.5 mg once a 
week.  </p>
<p>If your blood sugar is not controlled well enough, your doctor may increase your dose to 3 mg once a 
week.   </p>
<p>If further blood sugar control is needed the dose may be increased again to 4.5 mg once a week.   </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The starting dose for children and adolescents aged 10 years and above is 0.75 mg once a week. If 
your blood sugar is not controlled well enough after at least 4 weeks, your doctor may increase your 
dose to 1.5 mg once a week.  </p>
<p>Each pen contains one weekly dose of Trulicity (0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg or 4.5 mg). Each pen delivers 
only one dose.  </p>
<p>You can use your pen at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same 
day each week if you can. To help you remember, you may wish to tick the day of the week when you 
inject your first dose on the box that your pen comes in, or on a calendar. </p>
<p>Trulicity is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper 
leg (thigh). If the injection is given by someone else, they may inject in your upper arm. </p>
<p>If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a 
different injection site within that area. </p>
<p>It is important that you test your blood glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse, if you are taking Trulicity with a sulphonylurea or insulin. </p>
<p>Read the  Instructions for Use  for the pen carefully before using Trulicity. </p>
<p>If you use more Trulicity than you should<br />
If you use more Trulicity than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this medicine 
may make your blood sugar too low (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Trulicity<br />
If you forget to inject a dose, and if there are at least 3 days before your next dose is due, then inject 
your dose as soon as possible. Inject your next dose on your regular scheduled day. </p>
<p>If there are less than 3 days before your next dose is due, skip the dose and inject the next one on 
your regular scheduled day. </p>
<p>Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>You can also change the day of the week on which you inject Trulicity if necessary, as long as it has 
been at least 3 days since your last dose of Trulicity. 
If you stop using Trulicity<br />
Do not stop using Trulicity without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Trulicity, your blood 
sugar levels can increase. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
