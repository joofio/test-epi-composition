pharmacist or nurse if you or your child: 
* have a severe infection with a high fever. If this is the case, then vaccination will be postponed. The 
presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require postponement of the vaccination, 
but talk to your doctor first. 
* have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.<br />
<em> have a weakened immune system which may prevent you or your child from getting the full 
benefit from Trumenba.<br />
</em> have had any problems after any dose of Trumenba such as an allergic reaction or problems with 
breathing. </p>
<p>Fainting, feeling faint, or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection.

some types of cancer chemotherapies), you may not get the full benefit of Trumenba. </p>

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before Trumenba is given. Your doctor may still recommend that you receive 
Trumenba if you are at risk of meningococcal disease. </p>

Trumenba has no or little influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>However, some of the side effects mentioned under section 4  Possible side effects  may temporarily
