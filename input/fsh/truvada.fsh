active substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to treat HIV infection.  Emtricitabine is 
a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor.  However, both are generally known as NRTIs and they work by interfering with the normal 
working of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to reproduce itself. </p>

or have caused side effects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Truvada should always be used combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. </p>
<p>Truvada can be administered in place of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil used

emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>Before taking Truvada to reduce the risk of getting HIV: </p>
<p>Truvada can only help reduce your risk of getting HIV before you are infected. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must be HIV negative before you start to take Truvada to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV.  You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV infection. Do not take 
Truvada to reduce your risk unless you are confirmed to be HIV negative.  People who do have 
HIV must take Truvada in combination with other drugs.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many HIV tests can miss a recent infection.  If you get a flu-like illness, it could mean you 
have recently been infected with HIV. 
These may be signs of HIV infection: </p>
</li>
<li>tiredness </li>
<li>fever </li>
<li>joint or muscle aches </li>
<li>headache </li>
<li>vomiting or diarrhoea </li>
<li>rash </li>
<li>night sweats </li>
<li>enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your doctor about any flu-like illness   either in the month before starting 
Truvada, or at any time while taking Truvada. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>While taking Truvada to reduce the risk of getting HIV: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take Truvada every day to reduce your risk, not just when you think you have been at risk 
of HIV infection.  Do not miss any doses of Truvada, or stop taking it.  Missing doses may 
increase your risk of getting HIV infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get tested for HIV regularly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you think you were infected with HIV, tell your doctor straight away.  They may want to do 
more tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just taking Truvada may not stop you getting HIV. * 
Always practice safer sex.  Use condoms to reduce contact with semen, vaginal fluids, 
or blood. * 
Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, such as 
toothbrushes and razor blades. * 
Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment.  * 
Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea.<br />
These infections make it easier for HIV to infect you. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask your doctor if you have any more questions about how to prevent getting HIV or spreading HIV 
to other people. </p>
<p>While taking Truvada to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of getting HIV: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Truvada may affect your kidneys.  Before and during treatment, your doctor may order blood 
tests to measure kidney function.  Tell your doctor if you have had kidney disease, or if tests 
have shown kidney problems. Truvada should not be given to adolescents with existing kidney 
problems. If you have kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop taking Truvada or, 
if you already have HIV, to take Truvada less frequently.  Truvada is not recommended if you 
have severe kidney disease or are on dialysis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you suffer from osteoporosis, have a history of bone fracture or if 
you have problems with your bones. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects).  Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass.  The most pronounced bone loss was 
seen in clinical studies when patients were treated for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with a boosted protease inhibitor. </p>
<p>Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk in 
adult and paediatric patients are uncertain. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients 
infected with HIV who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are 
treated with antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.<br />
If you have hepatitis B or C, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen 
for you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know your hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status before starting Truvada.  If you have 
HBV, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop taking Truvada, whether or not 
you also have HIV.  It is important not to stop taking Truvada without talking to your doctor: 
see section 3, Do not stop taking Truvada. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are over 65.  Truvada has not been studied in patients over 65 years 
of age.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are intolerant to lactose (see Truvada contains lactose later in this 
section). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Truvada is not for use in children under 12 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Truvada </p>
<p>Do not take Truvada if you are already taking other medicines that contain the components of 
Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil) or any other antiviral medicines that contain 
tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. </p>
<p>Taking Truvada with other medicines that can damage your kidneys: it is especially important to 
tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, including 
* aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection) 
* amphotericin B (for fungal infection) 
* foscarnet (for viral infection) 
* ganciclovir (for viral infection) 
* pentamidine (for infections) 
* vancomycin (for bacterial infection) 
* interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) 
* cidofovir (for viral infection) 
* non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) </p>
<p>If you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat HIV, your doctor may 
order blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function. </p>
<p>It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. </p>
<p>Taking Truvada with other medicines containing didanosine (for treatment of HIV infection): 
Taking Truvada with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of 
didanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and 
lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes causes death, have been reported 
when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your doctor will 
carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines.  Tell your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Truvada with food and drink </p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, Truvada should be taken with food. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>If you have taken Truvada during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and 
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took 
NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of 
side effects. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Truvada.  This is because the active substances in 
this medicine pass into human breast milk. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your 
doctor as soon as possible. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Truvada can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy while taking Truvada, do not drive and do not use any 
tools or machines. </p>
<p>Truvada contains lactose </p>
<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Truvada contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""

</li>
<li>
<p>If you are being treated for HIV infection your doctor will prescribe Truvada with other 
antiretroviral medicines.  Please refer to the patient information leaflets of the other 
antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those medicines. </p>

</ul>
<p>Do not stop taking Truvada without contacting your doctor.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Truvada treatment without 
talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after stopping 
treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not 
recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. </li>

<p>Possible serious side effects:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side 
effect.  Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in 
people with liver disease.  The following may be signs of lactic acidosis: </li>
<li>deep rapid breathing </li>
<li>drowsiness </li>
<li>feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)  </li>
<li>stomach pain </li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak 
immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon 
after anti-HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement 
in the body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been 
present with no obvious symptoms.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines to treat HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as: </p>
</li>
<li>muscle weakness </li>
<li>weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body </li>
<li>palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity </li>
</ul>

immediately. </p>
<p>Possible side effects: </p>
<p>Very common side effects<br />
(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
* diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) 
* dizziness, headache 
* rash 
* feeling weak </p>
<p>Tests may also show: 
* decreases in phosphate in the blood 
* increased creatine kinase </p>
<p>Common side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* pain, stomach pain 
* difficulty sleeping, abnormal dreams 
* problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals, feeling bloated, flatulence 
* rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), 
which may be allergic reactions, itching, changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin 
in patches 
* other allergic reactions, such as wheezing, swelling or feeling light-headed 
* loss of bone mass </p>
<p>Tests may also show: 
* low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to 
infection) 
* increased triglycerides (fatty acids), bile or sugar in the blood 
* liver and pancreas problems </p>
<p>Uncommon side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of the pancreas 
* swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat 
* anaemia (low red blood cell count) 
* breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness which may occur due to damage to the kidney 
tubule cells </p>
<p>Tests may also show: 
* decreases in potassium in the blood 
* increased creatinine in your blood 
* changes to your urine </p>
<p>Rare side effects 
(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
* Lactic acidosis (see Possible serious side effects) 
* fatty liver 
* yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (tummy) caused by inflammation of 
the liver 
* inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty, kidney failure, damage to 
kidney tubule cells 
* softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) 
* back pain caused by kidney problems </p>
<p>Damage to kidney tubule cells may be associated with breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones 
(with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in 
potassium or phosphate in the blood. </p>
<p>If you notice any of the side effects listed above or if any of the side effects get serious, talk 
to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>The frequency of the following side effects is not known.<br />
* Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Truvada 
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, 
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of 
the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: 
* joint stiffness 
* joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) 
* difficulty with movement </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </p>
<p>During treatment for HIV there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.<br />
This is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the 
HIV medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. </p>
<p>Other effects in children<br />
<em> Children given emtricitabine very commonly experienced changes in skin colour 
including<br />
</em> darkening of the skin in patches 
* Children commonly experienced low red blood cell count (anaemia). 
* this may cause the child to be tired or breathless  </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects
