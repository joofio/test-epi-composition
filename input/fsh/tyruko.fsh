  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tyruko is used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). It contains the active substance natalizumab. This is 
called a monoclonal antibody. </p>
<p>MS causes inflammation in the brain that damages the nerve cells. This inflammation happens when 
white blood cells get into the brain and spinal cord. This medicine stops the white blood cells getting 
through to the brain. This reduces nerve damage caused by MS. </p>
<p>Symptoms of multiple sclerosis 
The symptoms of MS vary from patient to patient, and you may experience some or none of them. </p>
<p>They may include: walking problems, numbness in the face, arms or legs; problems with vision; 
tiredness; feeling off-balance or light headed; bladder and bowel problems; difficulty in thinking and 
concentrating; depression; acute or chronic pain; sexual problems; stiffness and muscle spasms. When 
the symptoms flare up, it is called a relapse (also known as an exacerbation or an attack). When a 
relapse occurs, you may notice the symptoms suddenly, within a few hours, or slowly progressing over 
several days. Your symptoms will then usually improve gradually (this is called a remission). </p>
<p>How Tyruko can help 
In trials, this medicine approximately halved the build-up of disability caused by MS, and decreased 
the number of MS attacks by about two-thirds. While you are treated with this medicine you might not 
notice any improvement, but it may still be working to prevent your MS becoming worse. </p>         </div>"""

the benefits you could expect to receive from this treatment and the risks that are associated with it. </p>
<p>You must not be given Tyruko 
* If you are allergic to natalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have been diagnosed with PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). PML is 
an uncommon infection of the brain. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your immune system has a serious problem. This may be due to disease (such as HIV), or to 
a medicine you are taking, or have taken in the past (see below). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are taking medicines that affect your immune system, including certain other 
medicines used to treat MS. These medicines cannot be used with Tyruko. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have cancer (unless it is a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>You need to discuss with your doctor whether Tyruko is the most suitable treatment for you. Do this 
before you start taking Tyruko, and when you have been receiving Tyruko for more than two years. </p>
<p>Possible brain infection (PML) </p>
<p>Some people receiving this medicine (fewer than 1 in 100) have had an uncommon brain infection 
called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). PML can lead to severe disability or death. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before starting treatment, all patients will have blood tests arranged by the doctor for JC virus 
infection. JC virus is a common virus that does not normally make you ill. However, PML is 
linked to an increase of JC virus in the brain. The reason for this increase in some patients 
treated with Tyruko is not clear. Before and during treatment, your doctor will test your blood to 
check if you have antibodies to the JC virus, which are a sign that you have been infected by the 
JC virus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your doctor will arrange a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, which will be repeated 
during treatment to rule out PML. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The symptoms of PML may be similar to an MS relapse (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
You can also get PML up to 6 months after stopping Tyruko treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice your MS getting worse, if you notice any 
new symptoms while you are on Tyruko treatment or for up to 6 months afterwards. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your partner or caregivers about what to look out for (see also section 4, Possible side 
effects). Some symptoms might be difficult to spot by yourself, such as changes in mood or 
behaviour, confusion, speech and communication difficulties. If you get any of these, you may 
need further tests. Keep looking out for symptoms in the 6 months after stopping Tyruko. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the patient alert card you have been given by your doctor. It includes this information. 
Show it to your partner or caregivers. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Three things can increase your risk of PML with Tyruko. If you have two or more of these risk 
factors, the risk is increased further: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have antibodies to the JC virus in your blood. These are a sign that the virus is in your 
body. You will be tested before and during Tyruko treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are treated for a long time with Tyruko, especially if it is more than two years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have taken a medicine called an immunosuppressant, that reduces the activity of your 
immune system. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another condition, called JCV GCN (JC virus granule cell neuronopathy), is also caused by JC virus 
and has occurred in some patients receiving Tyruko. The symptoms of JCV GCN are similar to PML. </p>
<p>For those with a lower risk of PML, your doctor may repeat the test regularly to check that: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You still do not have antibodies to the JC virus in your blood. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have been treated for more than 2 years, you still have a lower level of JC virus 
antibodies in your blood. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone gets PML 
PML can be treated, and Tyruko treatment will be stopped. However, some people get a reaction as 
Tyruko is removed from the body. This reaction (known as IRIS or immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome) may lead to your condition getting worse, including worsening of brain 
function. </p>
<p>Look out for other infections 
Some infections other than PML may also be serious and can be due to viruses, bacteria, and other 
causes. </p>
<p>Tell a doctor or nurse immediately if you think you have an infection (see also section 4, Possible 
side effects). </p>
<p>Changes in blood platelets 
Natalizumab may reduce platelets in the blood which are responsible for clotting. This may result in a 
condition called thrombocytopenia (see section 4) in which your blood may not clot quickly enough to 
stop bleeding. This can lead to bruising as well as other more serious problems such as excessive 
bleeding. You should talk to your doctor immediately if you have unexplained bruising, red or purple 
spots on the skin (called petechiae), bleeding from skin cuts that does not stop or oozes, prolonged 
bleeding from the gums or nose, blood in urine or stools, or bleeding in the whites of your eyes. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents under the age of 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Tyruko 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must not be given this medicine if you are now being treated with medicines that affect 
your immune system, including certain other medicines to treat your MS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might not be able to use this medicine if you have previously had any that affect your 
immune system. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not use this medicine if you are pregnant, unless you have discussed this with your 
doctor. Be sure to tell your doctor immediately if you get pregnant, think you may be pregnant, 
or if you are planning to become pregnant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not breast-feed whilst using Tyruko. Your doctor will help you decide whether you should 
choose to stop breast-feeding or stop using the medicine. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The risk to the baby and benefit to the mother will be taken into consideration by your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness is a very common side effect. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Tyruko contains sodium 
Each vial of this medicine contains 2.3 mmol (or 52 mg) of sodium. After dilution for use, this 
medicinal product contains 17.7 mmol (or 406 mg) sodium per dose. This should be considered if you 
are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Information for medical or healthcare professionals on how to prepare and administer the 
medicine is provided at the end of this leaflet. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you stop using Tyruko 
Regular dosing with Tyruko is important, especially in the first few months of treatment. It is 
important to continue with your medicine for as long as you and your doctor decide that it is helping 
you. Patients who received one or two doses of Tyruko, and then had a gap in treatment of three 
months or more, were more likely to have an allergic reaction when restarting treatment. </p>
<p>Checking for allergic reactions 
A few patients have had an allergic reaction to this medicine. Your doctor may check for allergic 
reactions during the infusion and for 1 hour afterwards. See also section 4, Possible side effects. </p>
<p>If you miss your dose of Tyruko 
If you miss your usual dose of Tyruko, arrange with your doctor to receive it as soon as you can. You 
can then continue to receive your dose of Tyruko every 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Will Tyruko always work? 
In a few patients receiving Tyruko, the body s natural defences may stop the medicine from working 
properly over time, as the body develops antibodies to the medicine. Your doctor can decide whether 
this medicine is not working properly for you from blood tests and will stop the treatment, if 
necessary. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on Tyruko, ask your doctor. Always use this medicine exactly as 
described in this leaflet or as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. </p>         </div>"""
