  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What is Ultomiris 
Ultomiris is a medicine that contains the active substance ravulizumab and it belongs to a class of 
medicines called monoclonal antibodies, that attach to a specific target in the body. Ravulizumab has 
been designed to attach to the C5 complement protein, which is a part of the body s defence system 
called the  complement system . </p>
<p>What is Ultomiris used for 
Ultomiris is used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease called paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), including patients untreated with complement inhibitor and 
patients who have received eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. In patients with PNH, the 
complement system is overactive and attacks their red blood cells, which can lead to low blood counts 
(anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, abdominal pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, 
difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction and blood clots. By attaching to and blocking the C5 
complement protein, this medicine can stop complement proteins from attacking red blood cells and so 
control symptoms of the disease.  </p>
<p>Ultomiris is also used to treat adult and children patients 10 kg and over with a disease affecting the 
blood system and kidney called atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), including patients 
untreated with complement inhibitor and patients who have received eculizumab for at least 3 months. 
In patients with aHUS, their kidneys and blood vessels, including platelets, can be inflamed which can 
lead to low blood counts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood 
clots, tiredness and difficulty in functioning. Ultomiris can block the body s inflammatory response, 
and its ability to attack and destroy its own vulnerable blood vessels and so control symptoms of the 
disease including injury to the kidneys. </p>
<p>Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a certain type of disease affecting the muscles called 
generalised Myasthenia Gravis (gMG). In patients with gMG, their muscles can be attacked and 
damaged by the immune system which can lead to profound muscle weakness, impaired vision and 
mobility, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, risk for aspiration, and markedly impaired activities of 
daily living. Ultomiris can block the body s inflammatory response, and its ability to attack and 
destroy its own muscles to improve muscle contraction, thereby reducing symptoms of the disease and 
impact of the disease on the activities of daily living. Ultomiris is specifically indicated for patients 
who remain symptomatic despite treatment with other therapies. </p>
<p>Ultomiris is also used to treat adult patients with a disease of the central nervous system that mainly 
affects the optic (eye) nerves and the spinal cord called Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder 
(NMOSD). In patients with NMOSD, the optic nerves and spinal cord are attacked and damaged by 
the immune system working incorrectly, which can lead to loss of sight in one or both eyes, weakness 
or loss of movement in the legs or arms, painful spasms, loss of feeling, problems with bladder and 
bowel function and marked difficulties with activities of daily living. Ultomiris can block the body s 
abnormal immune response, and its ability to attack and destroy its own optic nerves and spinal cord, 
which reduces the risk of a relapse or attack of NMOSD. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Ultomiris<br />
- If you are allergic to ravulizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection. 
- If you have meningococcal infection. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor before using Ultomiris. </p>
<p>Meningococcal and other Neisseria infections symptoms 
Because the medicine blocks the complement system, which is part of the body s defences against 
infection, the use of Ultomiris increases your risk of meningococcal infection caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis. These are severe infections affecting the linings of the brain which can cause 
inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and can spread throughout the blood and body (sepsis).  </p>
<p>Consult your doctor before you start Ultomiris to be sure that you receive vaccination against 
Neisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks 
beforehand, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you 
have been vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should 
also be aware that vaccination may not always prevent this type of infection. In accordance with 
national recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to 
prevent infection.  </p>
<p>Meningococcal infection symptoms </p>
<p>Because of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating meningococcal infection in patients who 
receive Ultomiris, you will be provided a  Patient card  to carry with you at all times, listing relevant 
signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection/sepsis /encephalitis.<br />
If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>headache with nausea or vomiting </li>
<li>headache and fever </li>
<li>headache with a stiff neck or stiff back </li>
<li>fever </li>
<li>fever and rash  </li>
<li>confusion  </li>
<li>muscle aches with flu-like symptoms </li>
<li>eyes sensitive to light </li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment for meningococcal infection while travelling </p>
<p>If you are travelling in a region where you are unable to contact your doctor or will be temporarily 
unable to receive medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic against Neisseria 
meningitidis to bring with you. If you experience any of the symptoms described above, you should 
take the course of antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should still see a doctor 
as soon as possible, even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. </p>
<p>Infections 
Before starting Ultomiris, inform your doctor if you have any infections. </p>
<p>Infusion-related reactions 
When Ultomiris is given, you may experience reactions to the infusion (drip) (infusion reaction) such 
as headache, lower back pain, and infusion-related pain. Some patients may experience allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty 
breathing or dizziness). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal infections. </p>
<p>Elderly 
There are no special precautions needed for the treatment of patients aged from 65 years and over, 
although experience with Ultomiris in elderly patients with PNH, aHUS, or NMOSD in clinical 
studies is limited. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ultomiris<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential </p>
<p>The effects of the medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, effective contraception 
during treatment and up to 8 months after treatment should be used in women who are able to get 
pregnant. </p>
<p>Pregnancy/ Breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
Ultomiris is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  </p>
<p>Ultomiris contains sodium 
Once diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, this medicine contains 
2.65 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 720 mL at the maximal dose. This is 
equivalent to 133 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
You should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>At least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will give you a vaccine against 
meningococcal infections if you have not previously had one or if your vaccination is outdated. If you 
cannot be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will 
prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. 
If your child is less than 18 years, your doctor will administer a vaccine (if not yet done) against 
Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination 
recommendations for each age group. </p>
<p>Instructions for proper use 
Your dose of Ultomiris will be calculated by your doctor, based on your body weight, as shown in 
Table 1. Your first dose is called the loading dose. Two weeks after receiving your loading dose, you 
will be given a maintenance dose of Ultomiris, and this will then be repeated once every 8 weeks for 
patient above 20 kg and every 4 weeks for patient less than 20 kg.  </p>
<p>If you were previously receiving Ultomiris subcutaneously (given under the skin through an on-body 
injector), no loading dose is required. Ultomiris intravenous maintenance dose should be given 1 week 
after the last dose of Ultomiris subcutaneous formulation. </p>
<p>If you were previously receiving another medicine for PNH, aHUS, gMG, or NMOSD called 
eculizumab, the loading dose should be given 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion.  </p>
