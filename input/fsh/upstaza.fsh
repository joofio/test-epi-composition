Upstaza is a gene therapy medicine that contains the active substance eladocagene exuparvovec. </p>
<p>What Upstaza is used for 
Upstaza is used for the treatment of patients aged 18 months and older, with a deficiency of the protein 
called aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). This protein is essential to make certain 
substances that the body’s nervous system needs to work properly.  </p>
<p>AADC deficiency is an inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in the gene that controls the 
production of AADC (also called dopa decarboxylase or DDC gene). The condition prevents 
development of the child’s nervous system, which means that many of the body’s functions do not 
develop correctly during childhood, including movement, eating, breathing, speech and mental ability. </p>
<p>How Upstaza works 
The active substance in Upstaza, eladocagene exuparvovec, is a type of virus called adeno-associated 
virus that has been modified to include a copy of the DDC gene that works correctly. Upstaza is given 
by infusion (drip) into an area of the brain called the putamen, where AADC is made. The 
adeno-associated virus allows the DDC gene to pass into brain cells. In this way, Upstaza enables the 
cells to produce AADC so that the body can then make the substances that the nervous system needs.  </p>
<p>The adeno-associated virus used to deliver the gene does not cause disease in humans.  </p>         </div>"""

medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
<em> Mild or moderate uncontrollable jerky movements (also called dyskinesia) or sleep disorders 
(insomnia) may occur or worsen 1 month after treatment with Upstaza and last for several 
months after. Your doctor will decide if you or your child needs treatment for these effects.<br />
</em> The doctor will monitor you or your child for complications of Upstaza treatment, such as 
leakage of the fluid surrounding the brain, meningitis, or encephalitis.<br />
<em> Within the next days following the surgery, the doctor will monitor you or your child for any 
complications secondary to the surgery, the disease, and to the general anaesthesia. Some of the 
disease symptoms may be amplified during that period.<br />
</em> Some specific symptoms of AADC deficiency may persist after treatment, examples of such 
symptoms may include impact on mood, sweating, and body temperature. 
* After treatment, some medicine may enter your or your child’s body fluids (eg, tears, blood, 
nasal secretions, and cerebrospinal fluid); this is known as ‘shedding’. You or your child and the 
child’s caregiver (especially if pregnant, breast-feeding, or with a suppressed immune system) 
should wear gloves and place any used dressings and other waste material with tears and nasal 
secretions in sealed bags before throwing them away. You should follow these precautions for 
14 days.<br />
* You or your child must not donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for transplantation after 
treatment with Upstaza. This is because Upstaza is a gene therapy product.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Upstaza has not been studied in children under 18 months of age. Limited experience is available in 
children above 12 years.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Upstaza 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>You or your child can receive routine childhood vaccinations as normal. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>The effects of this medicine on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known.  </p>
<p>Upstaza has not been studied in breast-feeding women.  </p>
<p>There is no information on the effect of Upstaza on male or female fertility. </p>
<p>Upstaza contains sodium and potassium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘potassium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

</em> Before giving Upstaza, the neurosurgeon will make two small holes in you or your child’s skull, 
one on each side. 
* Upstaza will then be infused through these holes into four sites in your or your child’s brain, in 
an area called the putamen. 
* After the infusion, the two holes will be closed, and you or your child will have a brain scan. 
* You or your child will need to stay in or near the hospital for a few days to monitor recovery 
and check for any side effects from the surgery or the anaesthesia. 
* The doctor will see you or your child in the hospital twice, once around 1 week after the 
surgery, and then 3 weeks after the surgery, to continue following up on recovery and to check 
for any side effects from the surgery and treatment. </p>
