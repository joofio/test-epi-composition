way to the natural substance prostacyclin, making them relax and widen.
Uptravi is used for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients 
insufficiently controlled with other types of medicines for PAH known as endothelin receptor 
antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Uptravi can be used on its own if the patient is not 
a candidate for these medicines.
PAH is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (the 
pulmonary arteries). In people with PAH, these arteries narrow, so the heart has to work harder to 
pump blood through them. This may cause people to feel tired, dizzy, short of breath, or experience 
other symptoms.
By acting in a similar way to the natural substance prostacyclin, this medicine widens the pulmonary 
arteries and reduces their hardening. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood through the 
pulmonary arteries. Uptravi lowers the pressure in the pulmonary arteries, it relieves the symptoms of 
PAH and slows down progression of PAH disease.</p>         </div>"""

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Uptravi is not recommended during pregnancy and breast-feeding. If you are a woman who can have 
children, you should use an effective contraceptive method while taking Uptravi. If you are pregnant 
or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Uptravi can cause side effects such as headaches and low blood pressure (see section 4), which may 
affect your ability to drive; the symptoms of your condition can also make you less fit to drive.</p>         </div>"""

medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are in doubt or have any 
questions.
Tell your doctor if you experience side effects, as your doctor may recommend that you change your 
Uptravi dose.
Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines as your doctor may recommend that you take 
Uptravi only once daily.
If you have poor vision or experience any type of blindness, get help from another person when taking 
Uptravi during the titration period (process of gradually increasing your dose).
Finding the right dose for you
At the start of treatment, you will take the lowest dose. This is one 200 microgram tablet in the 
morning and another 200 microgram tablet in the evening, about 12 hours apart. It is 
recommended to initiate treatment in the evening. Your doctor will instruct you to gradually increase 
your dose. This is called titration. It lets your body adjust to the new medicine. The goal of titration is 
to reach the most appropriate dose. This will be the highest dose you can tolerate, which may reach the 
maximum dose of 1,600 micrograms in the morning and in the evening.
The first pack of tablets you receive will contain the light-yellow 200 microgram tablets.
Your doctor will tell you to increase your dose in steps, usually every week but the interval between 
increases could be longer.
With each step, you will add one 200 microgram tablet to your morning dose and another 
200 microgram tablet to your evening dose. The first intake of the increased dose is recommended 
to be in the evening. The diagram below shows the number of tablets to take every morning and 
every evening for the first 4 steps.
If your doctor tells you to increase your dose further, you will add one 200 microgram tablet to your 
morning dose and one 200 microgram tablet to your evening dose with each new step. The first intake 
of the increased dose is recommended to be in the evening.
If your doctor instructs you to further increase your dose and move to step 5, this may be done by 
taking one green 800 microgram tablet and one light-yellow 200 microgram tablet in the morning and 
one 800 microgram tablet and one 200 microgram tablet in the evening.
The maximum dose of Uptravi is 1,600 micrograms in the morning and 1,600 micrograms in the 
evening. However, not every patient will reach this dose, because different patients require different 
doses.
The diagram below shows the number of tablets to take every morning and every evening at 
each step, starting with step 5. You will receive the titration pack which contains a titration guide and Patient Leaflet. The titration 
guide is providing information on the titration process and is allowing you to record the number of 
tablets you take every day.
Remember to record the number of tablets you take every day in your titration diary. The titration 
steps usually last about 1 week. If your doctor instructs you to prolong each titration step longer than 
1 week, there are additional diary pages to allow you to track this. Remember to talk to your PAH 
doctor or nurse regularly during titration.
Stepping down to a lower dose due to side effects
During titration, you may experience side effects such as headache, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), 
being sick (vomiting), jaw pain, muscle pain, leg pain, joint pain, or reddening of the face (see 
section 4). If these side effects are difficult for you to tolerate, talk to your doctor about how to 
manage or treat them. There are treatments available that can help relieve the side effects. For 
example, painkillers such as paracetamol may help treat pain and headache.
If the side effects cannot be treated or do not gradually get better on the dose you are taking, your 
doctor may adjust your dose by reducing the number of 200 microgram light-yellow tablets you take 
by one in the morning and by one in the evening. The diagram below shows stepping down to a lower 
dose. Do this only if instructed to do so by your doctor.
If your side effects are manageable after stepping down your dose, your doctor may decide that you 
should stay on that dose. Please see section Maintenance dose below for more information.
Maintenance dose
The highest dose that you can tolerate during titration will become your maintenance dose. Your 
maintenance dose is the dose you should continue to take on a regular basis.
Your doctor will prescribe a suitable tablet strength for your maintenance dose. This allows you to 
take one tablet in the morning and one in the evening, instead of multiple tablets each time.
For a full description of Uptravi tablets, including colours and marking, please see section 6 of this 
leaflet.
Over time, your doctor may adjust your maintenance dose as needed.
If, at any time, after taking the same dose for a long time, you experience side effects that you cannot 
tolerate or side effects that have an impact on your normal daily activities, contact your doctor as your 
dose may need to be reduced. The doctor may then prescribe you a lower single-tablet strength. Please 
remember to dispose of unused tablets (see section 5).
Take Uptravi once in the morning and once in the evening, about 12 hours apart.
Take the tablets with meals as you might tolerate your medicine better. The tablet coating provides 
protection. Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. Do not split, crush or chew the tablets.
If you take more Uptravi than you should
If you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, ask your doctor for advice.
If you forget to take Uptravi
If you forget to take Uptravi, take a dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your tablets 
at the usual times. If it is nearly time for your next dose (within 6 hours before you would normally 
take it), you should skip the missed dose and continue to take your medicine at the usual time. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.
If you stop taking Uptravi
Suddenly stopping your treatment with Uptravi might lead to your symptoms getting worse. Do not 
stop taking Uptravi unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to reduce the dose 
gradually before stopping completely.
If, for any reason, you stop taking Uptravi for more than 3 consecutive days (if you missed 3 morning 
and 3 evening doses, or 6 doses in a row or more), contact your doctor immediately as your dose 
may need to be adjusted to avoid side effects. Your doctor may decide to restart your treatment on a 
lower dose, gradually increasing to your previous maintenance dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.</p>         </div>"""

Starting Treatment with Uptravi
Please read the accompanying patient information leaflet before starting treatment. Tell your doctor if you 
experience side effects, as your doctor may recommend that you change your Uptravi dose. Tell your doctor if 
you are taking other medications as your doctor may recommend that you take Uptravi only once daily.

How should you take Uptravi?
Uptravi is a medicine taken every morning and 
evening for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, also called PAH.
The starting dose for Uptravi is 200 micrograms once 
in the morning and once in the evening.
The first intake of Uptravi should be in the evening.
You should take each dose with a glass of water, 
preferably during a meal.
There are 2 phases of treatment with Uptravi:
Titration
In the first several weeks, you will work with your 
doctor to find the dose of Uptravi that is right for 
you. Your doctor may have you step up from the 
starting dose to higher doses of Uptravi. Your doctor 
may step you down to a lower dose. This process is 
called titration. It lets your body gradually adjust to 
the medicine.
Maintenance
Once your doctor has found the dose that is right for 
you, this will be the dose you take on a regular basis. 
This is called the maintenance dose.
Page 6
Page 7
How should you step up your dose?
You will start at the 200 microgram dose in the 
morning and in the evening and after discussing with 
your doctor or nurse step up to the next dose.
The first intake of the increased dose should be in the 
evening. Each step usually lasts about 1 week. It 
could take several weeks to find the dose that is right 
for you.
The goal is to reach the dose that is most 
appropriate to treat you.
This dose will be your maintenance dose.
Every patient with PAH is different. Not everyone 
will end up on the same maintenance dose.
Some patients may have 200 micrograms in the 
morning and in the evening as their maintenance 
dose, while some will reach the highest dose of 
1,600 micrograms in the morning and in the evening.
Others may reach a maintenance dose somewhere 
inbetween. What is important is that you reach the 
dose that is most appropriate to treat you.

Page 9
Page Page  When should you step down?
As with all medicines, you may experience side 
effects with Uptravi as you step up to higher doses.
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have side 
effects. There are treatments available that can 
help relieve them.
The most common side effects (may affect more than 
1 in 10 people) you may experience while taking 
Uptravi are:
  Headache   Diarrhoea   Nausea   Vomiting   Jaw 
pain   Muscle pain   Leg pain   Joint pain   Facial 
redness
For a full list of side effects see package leaflet for 
further information.
If you cannot tolerate the side effects even after your 
doctor or nurse has tried to treat them, he or she may 
recommend you step down to a lower dose.
If your doctor or nurse tells you to step down to a 
lower dose, you should take one less 
200 microgram tablet in the morning and one less 
in the evening.
You should only step down after speaking with your 
PAH doctor or nurse. This stepping-down process 
will help you find the dose that is right for you, also 
called your maintenance dose.
Page Page Page Page When you move to your maintenance dose
The highest dose that you can tolerate during 
titration will become your maintenance dose. Your 
maintenance dose is the dose you should continue to 
take on a regular basis. Your doctor or nurse can 
prescribe an equivalent single-tablet strength for 
your maintenance dose.
This lets you take just one tablet in the morning 
and one in the evening, instead of multiple tablets 
for each dose.
For example, if your highest tolerated dose during 
titration was 1,200 micrograms once in the morning 
and once in the evening:
Over time, your doctor or nurse may adjust your 
maintenance dose as needed.
Page Page If you forget to take Uptravi
If you miss a dose, take the dose as soon as you 
remember, then continue to take your tablets at the 
usual times. If it is within 6 hours of when you would 
normally take your next dose, you should skip the 
missed dose and continue to take your medicine at 
the usual time.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten tablet.
If you stop taking Uptravi
Do not stop taking Uptravi unless your doctor or 
nurse tells you to. If, for any reason, you stop taking 
Uptravi for more than 3 consecutive days (if you 
missed 6 doses in a row), contact your PAH doctor 
or nurse immediately as your dose may need to be 
adjusted to avoid side effects.
Your doctor or nurse may have you resume treatment 
at a lower dose, gradually increasing to your previous 
maintenance dose.
Page Page Titration diary
Please read the instructions in the package leaflet 
carefully.
The following diary pages help you keep track of the 
number of tablets you need to take in the morning and 
evening during titration.
Use them to write down the number of tablets you 
take in the morning and the evening.
Each step usually lasts about 1 week, unless your 
doctor or nurse instructs you otherwise. If your 
titration steps last longer than 1 week there are 
additional diary pages to track this.
        Use pages 20 to 27 to track the first weeks of 
treatment, when you are using 
200 microgram tablets only (steps 1 4).
   If you have been prescribed both 200 and 
800 microgram tablets, use pages 30 to (steps 5 8).
Remember to talk to your PAH doctor or nurse 
regularly.
