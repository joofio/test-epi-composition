<p>Urorec belongs to a group of medicines called alpha1A-adrenoreceptor blockers. 
Urorec is selective for the receptors located in the prostate, bladder and urethra. By blocking these 
receptors, it causes smooth muscle in these tissues to relax. This makes it easier for you to pass water 
and relieves your symptoms. </p>
<p>What Urorec is used for </p>
<p>Urorec is used in adult men to treat the urinary symptoms associated with benign enlargement of the 
prostate (prostatic hyperplasia), such as: 
* difficulty in starting to pass water, 
* a feeling of not completely emptying the bladder, 
* a more frequent need to pass water, even at night. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Urorec </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are undergoing eye surgery because of cloudiness of the lens (cataract surgery), it is 
important that you immediately inform your eye specialist that you are using or have previously 
used Urorec. This is because some patients treated with this kind of medicine experienced a loss 
of muscle tone in the iris (the coloured circular part of the eye) during such a surgery. The 
specialist can take appropriate precautions with respect to medicine and surgical techniques to 
be used. Ask your doctor whether or not you should postpone or temporarily stop taking Urorec 
when undergoing cataract surgery. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have ever fainted or felt dizzy when suddenly standing up, please inform your doctor 
before taking Urorec.<br />
Dizziness when standing up and occasionally fainting may occur when taking Urorec, 
particularly when starting treatment or if you are taking other medicines that lower blood 
pressure. If this occurs, make sure you sit or lie down straight away until the symptoms have 
disappeared and inform your doctor as soon as possible (see also section “Driving and using 
machines”).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have severe liver problems, you should not take Urorec, as it was not tested in this 
condition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have problems with your kidneys, please ask your doctor for advice.<br />
If you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor will start Urorec with caution and possibly 
with a lower dose (see section 3 “Dose”).<br />
If you have severe kidney problems, you should not take Urorec. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since a benign enlargement of the prostate and prostate cancer may present the same symptoms, 
your doctor will check you for prostate cancer before starting treatment with Urorec. Urorec 
does not treat prostate cancer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment with Urorec may lead to an abnormal ejaculation (decrease in the amount of 
semen released during sex) that may temporarily affect male fertility. This effect disappears 
after discontinuation of Urorec. Please inform your doctor if you are planning to have children. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years since there is no relevant 
indication for this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Urorec </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor in particular, if you take: 
* medicines which lower blood pressure (in particular, medicines called alpha1-blockers, such 
as prazosin or doxazosin) as there may be the potential risk that the effect of these medicines is 
increased whilst taking Urorec. 
* antifungal medicines (such as ketoconazole or itraconazole), medicines used for HIV-AIDS 
(such as ritonavir) or medicines used after transplants to prevent organ rejection (such as 
cyclosporin) because these medicines can increase the blood concentration of Urorec. 
* medicines used for treating problems in getting or keeping an erection (such as sildenafil or 
tadalafil), since the concomitant use with Urorec might lead to a slight decrease in blood 
pressure.<br />
* medicines for epilepsy or rifampicin (a medicine to treat tubercolosis), since the effect of 
Urorec may be reduced. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Urorec is not intended for use by women. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>Urorec may reduce the amount of sperm, and so could temporarily affect your ability to father a child. 
If you are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Do not drive or operate machines if you feel faint, dizzy, drowsy or have blurred vision. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Patients with kidney problems<br />
If you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a different dose. For this purpose 
Urorec 4 mg hard capsules are available. </p>

<p>If you have taken more than one capsule, inform your doctor as soon as possible. If you become dizzy
