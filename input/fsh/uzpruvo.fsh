Uzpruvo contains the active substance  ustekinumab , a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies 
are proteins that recognise and bind specifically to certain proteins in the body.<br />
Uzpruvo belongs to a group of medicines called  immunosuppressants . These medicines work by 
weakening part of the immune system.<br />
What Uzpruvo is used for<br />
Uzpruvo is used to treat the following inflammatory diseases: </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis - in adults and children aged 6 years and older</p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis - in adults</p>
<p>Moderate to severe Crohn s disease - in adults
Plaque psoriasis<br />
Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes inflammation affecting the skin and nails. Uzpruvo will 
reduce the inflammation and other signs of the disease.<br />
Uzpruvo is used in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who cannot use ciclosporin, 
methotrexate or phototherapy, or where these treatments did not work.<br />
Uzpruvo is used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis who are unable to tolerate phototherapy or other systemic therapies or where these treatments 
did not work.<br />
Psoriatic arthritis<br />
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you 
have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you may be given Uzpruvo to:<br />
<em> Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.<br />
</em> Improve your physical function.<br />
* Slow down the damage to your joints.  </p>
<p>Crohn s disease 
Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn s disease you will first be 
given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough or are intolerant to these medicines, you 
may be given Uzpruvo to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Uzpruvo<br />
- If you are allergic to ustekinumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).<br />
- If you have an active infection which your doctor thinks is important.  </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Uzpruvo.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions <br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Uzpruvo. Your doctor will check how well you are 
before each treatment. Make sure you tell your doctor about any illness you have before each 
treatment. Also tell your doctor if you have recently been near anyone who might have tuberculosis. 
Your doctor will examine you and do a test for tuberculosis, before you have Uzpruvo. If your doctor 
thinks you are at risk of tuberculosis, you may be given medicines to treat it.   </p>
<p>Look out for serious side effects<br />
Uzpruvo can cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions and infections. You must look out 
for certain signs of illness while you are taking Uzpruvo. See  Serious side effects  in section 4 for a 
full list of these side effects.  </p>
<p>Before you use Uzpruvo tell your doctor<br />
<em> If you ever had an allergic reaction to Uzpruvo. Ask your doctor if you are not sure.<br />
</em> If you have ever had any type of cancer   this is because immunosuppressants like Uzpruvo 
weaken part of the immune system. This may increase the risk of cancer.<br />
<em> If you have been treated for psoriasis with other biologic medicines (a medicine 
produced from a biological source and usually given by injection)   the risk of cancer may 
be higher. 
* If you have or have had a recent infection.<br />
</em> If you have any new or changing lesions within psoriasis areas or on normal skin.<br />
<em> If you are having any other treatment for psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis   such as 
another immunosuppressant or phototherapy (when your body is treated with a type of 
ultraviolet (UV) light). These treatments may also weaken part of the immune system. Using 
these therapies together with Uzpruvo has not been studied. However it is possible it may 
increase the chance of diseases related to a weaker immune system.<br />
</em> If you are having or have ever had injections to treat allergies   it is not known if Uzpruvo 
may affect these.<br />
* If you are 65 years of age or over   you may be more likely to get infections.  </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Uzpruvo.  </p>
<p>Some patients have experienced lupus-like reactions including skin lupus or lupus-like syndrome 
during treatment with ustekinumab. Talk to your doctor right away if you experience a red, raised, 
scaly rash sometimes with a darker border, in areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun or with joint 
pains. </p>
<p>Heart attack and strokes 
Heart attack and strokes have been observed in a study in patients with psoriasis treated with 
ustekinumab. Your doctor will regularly check your risk factors for heart disease and stroke in order to 
ensure that they are appropriately treated. Seek medical attention right away if you develop chest pain, 
weakness or abnormal sensation on one side of your body, facial droop, or speech or visual 
abnormalities. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Uzpruvo is not recommended for use in children with psoriasis under 6 years of age, or for use in 
children and adolescents under 18 years of age with psoriatic arthritis and Crohn s disease, because it 
has not been studied in this age group.  </p>
<p>Other medicines, vaccines and Uzpruvo<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist<br />
<em> If you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.<br />
</em> If you have recently had or are going to have a vaccination. Some types of vaccines (live 
vaccines) should not be given while using Uzpruvo.<br />
* If you received Uzpruvo while pregnant, tell your baby s doctor about your Uzpruvo treatment 
before the baby receives any vaccine, including live vaccines, such as the BCG vaccine (used 
to prevent tuberculosis). Live vaccines are not recommended for your baby in the first six 
months after birth if you received Uzpruvo during the pregnancy unless your baby s doctor 
recommends otherwise. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
<em> It is preferable to avoid the use of Uzpruvo in pregnancy. The effects of Uzpruvo in pregnant 
women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid 
becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Uzpruvo and for at least 
15 weeks after the last Uzpruvo treatment.<br />
</em> Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby. 
* Uzpruvo can pass across the placenta to the unborn baby. If you received Uzpruvo during your 
pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. 
* It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals if you 
received Uzpruvo during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. Live vaccines 
such as the BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) are not recommended for your baby in 
the first six months after birth if you received Uzpruvo during the pregnancy unless your 
baby s doctor recommends otherwise. 
* Ustekinumab may pass into breast milk in very small amounts. Talk to your doctor if you are 
breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed. You and your doctor should decide if you should 
breast-feed or use Uzpruvo - do not do both.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Uzpruvo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  </p>         </div>"""

<em> The doctor will work out the right dose for you, including the amount (volume) of Uzpruvo to 
be injected to give the right dose. The right dose for you will depend on your body weight at the 
time each dose is given.

<p>How Uzpruvo is given<br />
<em> Uzpruvo is given as an injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ). At the start of your 
treatment, medical or nursing staff may inject Uzpruvo.<br />
</em> However, you and your doctor may decide that you may inject Uzpruvo yourself. In this case 
you will get training on how to inject Uzpruvo yourself.<br />
* For instructions on how to inject Uzpruvo, see  Instructions for administration  at the end of this 
leaflet.<br />
Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about giving yourself an injection.  </p>
<p>If you use more Uzpruvo than you should<br />
If you have used or been given too much Uzpruvo, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away. 
Always have the outer carton of the medicine with you, even if it is empty.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Uzpruvo<br />
If you forget a dose, contact your doctor or pharmacist. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten dose.  </p>
<p>If you stop using Uzpruvo<br />
It is not dangerous to stop using Uzpruvo. However, if you stop, your symptoms may come back.  </p>
