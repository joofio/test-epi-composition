  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Vafseo is a medicine that increases the amount of haemoglobin (the protein in your red blood cells 
that carries oxygen around the body) and the number of red blood cells in your blood. It contains the 
active substance vadadustat. </p>
<p>Vafseo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia (low levels of red blood cells or haemoglobin in your 
blood) that is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults on chronic maintenance dialysis. 
When the amount of haemoglobin or the number of red blood cells is low, the cells in your body might 
not receive enough oxygen. Anaemia can cause symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, or shortness of 
breath. </p>
<p>How Vafseo works 
Vafseo increases the level of a substance called  Hypoxia-Inducible Factor  (HIF), which increases 
the production of red blood cells when oxygen levels are low. By raising HIF levels, Vafseo increases 
the production of red blood cells and raises the levels of haemoglobin. This improves the oxygen 
supply to your body and may reduce your anaemia symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vafseo if you: 
* had blood clots in the past and/or have risk factors for blood clots. This medicine increases the 
production of red blood cells and this may increase the risk of developing blood clots. 
Examples of risk factors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>being overweight </li>
<li>diabetes </li>
<li>heart diseases </li>
<li>being off your feet for a long time because of surgery or illness </li>
<li>taking oral contraceptives 
It is important that you tell your doctor about previous heart attack, stroke, blood clots or risk 
factors so your doctor can decide if this medicine is a suitable treatment for your anaemia.<br />
Talk to your doctor immediately if you think you have developed a blood clot. You can find a 
description of possible blood clot symptoms below in section 4. * have high blood pressure (hypertension). Vafseo may worsen your high blood pressure. 
Therefore, it is very important that you take your high blood pressure medicines regularly and 
that you frequently check your blood pressure. </li>
<li>have severe liver disease. </li>
<li>have a convulsion or fit or possible warning signs that a convulsion may occur, such as 
headache, irritability, fear, confusion or unusual feelings </li>
<li>are converting from high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) because you might 
require red blood cell transfusion or supplemental ESA while the doctor is adjusting your 
Vafseo dose. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vafseo if you have any of the conditions mentioned 
above. </li>
</ul>
<p>Misuse can lead to an increase in red blood cells and consequently thicken the blood. This can cause 
life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. </p>
<p>Blood tests 
Chronic kidney disease can cause anaemia, which may increase the risk of heart and blood vessel 
problems and even death. Therefore, it is important to treat your anaemia. Your doctor will regularly 
check the amount of haemoglobin in your blood. 
The treatment may increase liver enzymes. Your doctor will regularly check the amount of these 
enzymes in your blood at the start of your treatment and then monthly for the first 3 months of your 
treatment.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give Vafseo to children and adolescents aged under 18 years. There is not enough information 
about its use in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vafseo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Vafseo may affect the way other medicines work, and medicines may affect how Vafseo<br />
works. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken, or are taking any of the following 
medicines: 
* Medicines to reduce phosphate levels in your blood (called phosphate binders) such as 
sevelamer carbonate or calcium acetate and medicines or supplements that contain iron such 
as ferric citrate, sucroferric oxyhydroxide, ferrous sulphate, sodium ferrous citrate. 
* probenecid, a medicine used to treat gout 
* sulfasalazine, a medicine to treat severe bowel and rheumatic joint inflammation 
* medicines known as statins to reduce cholesterol levels in your blood (examples include 
simvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin or pitavastatin)

* nelfinavir, efavirenz or zidovudine, medicines used to treat HIV 
* topotecan, a medicine used to treat cancer 
* famotidine, a medicine to treat stomach ulcers 
* methotrexate, a medicine used to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders 
* sitagliptin, a medicine to treat diabetes 
* celecoxib, a medicine to treat pain and inflammation 
* warfarin, a medicine used to stop blood clotting 
* phenytoin, a medicine used to treat epilepsy 
* benzylpenicillin, a medicine used to treat infections 
* teriflunomide, a medicine used to treat multiple sclerosis 
* p-aminohippuric acid, a diagnostic substance used in tests involving the kidney 
* bupropion, a medicine used to treat depression </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide how you should use these medicines during your treatment with Vafseo. </p>

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

<p>Your dose 
Your doctor will tell you what dose of Vafseo to take. Treatment with Vafseo will usually start at a 
daily dose of 300 mg. Thereafter, your doctor may either increase or decrease your daily dose in steps 
of 150 mg. The lowest dose is 150 mg per day and the highest dose is 600 mg per day. 
Always take Vafseo as prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>It is important that your doctor regularly checks the amount of haemoglobin in your blood. Based on 
these test results your doctor may increase or lower your dose. If the amount of haemoglobin in your 
blood becomes too high your treatment will be stopped. Do not restart your treatment until your doctor 
tells you to do so and use only the dose your doctor prescribes. </p>
<p>Taking Vafseo

* Take your Vafseo dose once every day. 
* Vafseo can be taken with food or between meals. 
* You can take Vafseo at any time before, during, or after dialysis </p>
<p>Phosphate binders and Vafseo 
If you are treated with phosphate binders which do not include iron (such as sevelamer carbonate or 
calcium acetate) or medicines containing calcium, magnesium or aluminium you should take Vafseo at 
least 1 hour before or 2 hours after taking those medicines, because otherwise vadadustat will not be 
properly absorbed by your body. If the phosphate binder you are taking contains iron, see the 
information below. </p>
<p>Iron containing products and Vafseo<br />
If you take medicines containing iron or phosphate binders containing iron you should take Vafseo at 
least 1 hour before those products. Vadadustat will not be properly absorbed by your body if you do 
not follow these instructions. </p>
<p>If you take more Vafseo than you should 
If you take more tablets or a higher dose than you should, contact your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Vafseo 
* Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not take two tablets on one day. 
* If more than 24 hours (1 day) remains before your next scheduled dose: take the missed dose 
as soon as possible and take the next dose on the next scheduled day. 
* If less than 24 hours (1 day) remains before your next scheduled dose: skip the missed dose 
and take the next dose on the next scheduled day. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Vafseo

doctor tells you to do so. </p>
