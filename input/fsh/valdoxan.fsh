Valdoxan is used in adults. </p>
<p>Depression is a continuing disturbance of mood that interferes with everyday life. The symptoms of 
depression vary from one person to another, but often include deep sadness, feelings of worthlessness, loss 
of interest in favourite activities, sleep disturbances, feeling of being slowed down, feelings of anxiety, 
changes in weight. 
The expected benefits of Valdoxan are to reduce and gradually remove the symptoms related to your 
depression. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take Valdoxan 
- if you are allergic to agomelatine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).<br />
- if your liver does not work properly (hepatic impairment). 
- if you are taking fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression) or 
ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
There could be some reasons why Valdoxan may not be suitable for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are taking medicines known to affect the liver. Ask your doctor for advice on which medicine 
that is. </li>
<li>If you are obese or overweight, ask your doctor for advice. </li>
<li>If you are diabetic, ask your doctor for advice. </li>
<li>If you have increased levels of liver enzymes before treatment, your doctor will decide if Valdoxan 
is right for you. </li>
<li>If you have bipolar disorder, have experienced or if you develop manic symptoms (a period of 
abnormally high excitability and emotions) talk to your doctor before you start taking this medicine 
or before you continue with this medicine (see also under  Possible side effects  in section 4). </li>
<li>If you are suffering from dementia, your doctor will make an individual evaluation of whether it is 
right for you to take Valdoxan. </li>
</ul>
<p>During your treatment with Valdoxan : </p>
<p>What to do to avoid potential serious liver problems 
- Your doctor should have checked that your liver is working properly before starting the 
treatment. Some patients may get increased levels of liver enzymes in their blood during treatment 
with Valdoxan.  Therefore follow-up tests should take place at the following time points:  </p>
<p>before initiation 
or 
dose increase 
around 
3 weeks 
around 
6 weeks 
around 
12 weeks 
around 
24 weeks 
Blood tests </p>
<p>Based on the evaluation of these tests your doctor will decide whether you should receive or 
continue using Valdoxan (see also under  How to take Valdoxan  in section 3). </p>
<p>Be vigilant about signs and symptoms that your liver may not be working properly 
- If you observe any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems: unusual darkening of the 
urine, light coloured stools, yellow skin/eyes, pain in the upper right belly, unusual fatigue 
(especially associated with other symptoms listed above), seek urgent advice from a doctor 
who may advise you to stop taking Valdoxan. </p>
<p>Effect of Valdoxan is not documented in patients aged 75 years and older. Valdoxan should therefore not 
be used in these patients. </p>
<p>Thoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression 
If you are depressed you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. These may be 
increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about 
two weeks but sometimes longer. </p>
<p>You may be more likely to think like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself. </li>
<li>if you are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal 
behaviour in young adults (aged less than 25 years) with psychiatric conditions who were being treated 
with an antidepressant.<br />
If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital 
straight away.  </li>
</ul>
<p>You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed and ask them to read this 
leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression is getting worse, or if they are 
worried about changes in your behaviour. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Valdoxan should not be used in children and adolescents (under 18 years old).  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Valdoxan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>You should not take Valdoxan together with certain medicines (see also under  Do not take Valdoxan  in 
section 2): fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression), ciprofloxacin (an 
antibiotic) can modify the expected dose of agomelatine in your blood. 
Make sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: propranolol (a beta-blocker 
used in the treatment of hypertension), enoxacin (antibiotic)  </p>
<p>Make sure to tell your doctor if you are smoking more than15 cigarettes/day. </p>
<p>Valdoxan with alcohol 
It is not advisable to drink alcohol while you are being treated with Valdoxan. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Breastfeeding should be discontinued if you take Valdoxan.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
You might experience dizziness or sleepiness which could affect your ability to drive or operate machines. 
Make sure that your reactions are normal before driving or operating machines. </p>
<p>Valdoxan contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Valdoxan contains sodium 
Valdoxan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

pharmacist if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>The recommended dose of Valdoxan is one tablet (25 mg) at bedtime. In some cases, your doctor may 
prescribe a higher dose (50 mg), i.e. two tablets to be taken together at bedtime.  </p>
<p>Method of administration 
Valdoxan is for oral use. You should swallow your tablet with a drink of water. Valdoxan can be taken 
with or without food. </p>
<p>Duration of treatment 
Valdoxan starts to act on symptoms of depression in most depressed people within two weeks of starting 
treatment. 
Your depression should be treated for a sufficient period of at least 6 months to ensure that you are free of 
symptoms. 
Your doctor may continue to give you Valdoxan when you are feeling better to prevent your depression 
from returning. </p>
<p>If you have trouble with your kidneys, your doctor will make an individual evaluation of whether it is safe 
for you to take Valdoxan. </p>
<p>Surveillance of the liver function (see also section 2): 
Your doctor will run laboratory tests to check that your liver is working properly before starting treatment 
and then periodically during treatment, usually after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.<br />
If your doctor increase the dose to 50mg, laboratory tests should be performed at this initiation and then 
periodically during treatment, usually after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Thereafter tests 
will be taken if the doctor finds it necessary. 
You must not use Valdoxan if your liver does not work properly.  </p>
<p>How to switch from an antidepressant medicine (SSRI/SNRI) to Valdoxan? 
If your doctor changes your previous antidepressant medicine from an SSRI or SNRI to Valdoxan, he/she 
will advise you on how you should discontinue your previous medicine when starting Valdoxan. 
You may experience discontinuation symptoms related to stopping of your previous medicine for a few 
weeks, even if the dose of your previous antidepressant medicine is decreased gradually.<br />
Discontinuation symptoms include: dizziness, numbness, sleep disturbances, agitation or anxiety, 
headaches, feeling sick, being sick and shaking. These effects are usually mild to moderate and disappear 
spontaneously within a few days.<br />
If Valdoxan is initiated while tapering the dosage of the previous medicine, possible discontinuation 
symptoms should not be confounded with a lack of early effect of Valdoxan. 
You should discuss with your doctor on the best way of stopping your previous antidepressant medicine 
when starting Valdoxan. </p>
<p>If you take more Valdoxan than you should 
If you have taken more Valdoxan than you should, or if for example a child has taken medicine by 
accident, contact your doctor immediately. 
The experience of overdoses with Valdoxan is limited but reported symptoms include pain in the upper 
part of the stomach, somnolence, fatigue, agitation, anxiety, tension, dizziness, cyanosis or malaise. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Valdoxan 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just carry on with the next dose at the usual 
time. 
The calendar printed on the blister containing the tablets should help you remembering when you last took 
a tablet of Valdoxan. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Valdoxan<br />
Do not stop taking your medicine without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this product, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
