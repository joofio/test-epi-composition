VANFLYTA contains the active substance quizartinib. It is a type of cancer medicine called a ‘protein 
kinase inhibitor’. The medicine is used along with chemotherapy to treat adults who have acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML, a type of blood cancer), with a mutation (change) in the FLT3 gene called 
‘FLT3-ITD’. VANFLYTA treatment may be continued also after a bone marrow transplant when 
patients have sufficiently recovered. </p>
<p>Your doctor will test your cancer cells for changes in the FLT3 gene to look for FLT3-ITD mutations 
beforehand to make sure that VANFLYTA is right for you. </p>
<p>How VANFLYTA works 
In AML, the body makes a large amount of abnormal white blood cells that do not mature to become 
healthy cells. VANFLYTA works by blocking the action of proteins called ‘tyrosine kinases’ in these 
abnormal cells. This slows down or stops the abnormal cells from dividing and growing 
uncontrollably, and helps immature cells grow into normal cells. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not take VANFLYTA 
* if you are allergic to quizartinib or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
* if you were born with a heart problem called ‘long QT syndrome’ (abnormal electrical activity 
of the heart that affects its rhythm). 
* if you are breast-feeding (see ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility’). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking VANFLYTA: 
* if you have or have had any heart problems including arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), 
myocardial infarction (heart attack) within 6 months, congestive heart failure (heart isn’t 
pumping hard enough), uncontrolled angina pectoris (chest pain) or uncontrolled hypertension 
(blood pressure that’s too high). 
* if you have been told you have low blood levels of potassium or magnesium. 
* if you are taking medicines that can prolong the QT interval (irregular heart rhythm; see ‘Other 
medicines and VANFLYTA’). 
* if you are taking strong CYP3A inhibitors (see ‘Other medicines and VANFLYTA’). 
* if you have or have had fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, tiredness or pain when 
urinating. </p>
<p>Monitoring during treatment with VANFLYTA 
Blood tests 
Your doctor will perform regular blood tests during treatment with VANFLYTA to check your blood 
cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) and electrolytes (salts such as sodium, 
potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride and bicarbonate in blood). Your doctor will check your 
electrolytes more often if you are experiencing diarrhoea or vomiting. </p>
<p>Electrocardiogram 
Before and during your treatment, your doctor will check your heart with an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
to make sure your heart is beating normally. ECGs will be done weekly initially and less often 
thereafter as decided by your doctor. Your doctor will check your heart more often if you are taking 
other medicines that prolong the QT interval (see ‘Other medicines and VANFLYTA’). </p>
<p>Infections in patients older than 65 years 
Elderly patients are at increased risk for very serious infections when compared to younger patients, 
especially in the early treatment period. If you are older than 65 years of age you will be closely 
monitored for the occurrence of severe infections during induction. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents below 18 years of age because there is not enough 
information about its use in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and VANFLYTA<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, vitamins, antacids (medicines for 
heartburn and stomach acidity) and herbal supplements. This is because some medicines can affect 
how VANFLYTA works. </p>
<p>In particular, the following medicines may increase the risk of side effects with VANFLYTA by 
increasing the levels of this medicine in the blood: 
* certain medicines used to treat fungal infections – such as itraconazole, posaconazole or 
voriconazole; 
* certain antibiotics – such as clarithromycin or telithromycin; 
* nefazodone, a medicine used to treat major depression. </p>
<p>The following medicines may reduce the effectiveness of VANFLYTA: 
* certain medicines used to treat tuberculosis – such as rifampicin; 
* certain medicines used to treat seizures or epilepsy – such as carbamazepine, primidone, 
phenobarbital or phenytoin; 
* certain medicines to treat prostatic cancer – such as apalutamide and enzalutamide; 
* mitotane – a medicine used for the treatment of symptoms of tumours of the adrenal glands; 
* bosentan – a medicine used to treat high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary arterial 
hypertension); 
* St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) – an herbal product used for anxiety and mild 
depression. </p>
<p>Certain medicines use to treat HIV may either increase the risk of side effects (e.g., ritonavir) or 
reduce the effectiveness (e.g., efavirenz or etravirine) of VANFLYTA. </p>
<p>QT interval prolonging medicinal products 
Co-administration of VANFLYTA with other medicinal products that prolong the QT interval may 
further increase the risk of QT prolongation. Examples of QT prolonging medicinal products include 
but are not limited to antifungal azoles, ondansetron, granisetron, azithromycin, pentamidine, 
doxycycline, moxifloxacin, atovaquone, prochlorperazine and tacrolimus.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>You should not take VANFLYTA during pregnancy. This is because it may harm your unborn baby. 
Women who are able to become pregnant should have a pregnancy test within 7 days before taking 
this medicine. </p>
<p>Women should use effective contraception during treatment with VANFLYTA and for at least 
7 months after stopping treatment. Men should use effective contraception during treatment with 
VANFLYTA and for at least 4 months after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with VANFLYTA, and for at least 5 weeks after stopping 
treatment. This is because it is not known if VANFLYTA passes into your breast milk (see ‘Do not 
take VANFLYTA’). 
If you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>VANFLYTA may reduce fertility in women and men. You should discuss this with your doctor before 
starting treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
VANFLYTA is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

daily for 2 weeks and then increase your dose to 53 mg (two 26.5 mg tablets) once daily going forward 
depending on how you respond to VANFLYTA. </p>
<p>Your doctor may temporarily interrupt treatment or change your dose based on blood tests, side effects 
or other medicines you may be taking. </p>
<p>Your doctor will discontinue your treatment if you are having a stem cell transplant. Your doctor will 
tell you when to stop taking your medicine and when to restart it. </p>
<p>Taking this medicine 
* Take VANFLYTA by mouth - either with or without food.

your condition to check that the treatment is continuing to work. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how long to take VANFLYTA, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you take more VANFLYTA than you should 
If you accidentally take more tablets than you should, or if someone else accidentally takes your 
medicine, talk to a doctor straightaway or go to a hospital and take this package leaflet with you. 
Medical treatment may be necessary. </p>
<p>If you forget to take VANFLYTA<br />
If you forget to take VANFLYTA, take it as soon as possible on the same day. Take your next dose at 
your usual time on the next day. </p>
<p>Do not take an extra dose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking VANFLYTA 
Stopping your treatment with VANFLYTA may cause your condition to become worse. Do not stop 
taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to do so. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
