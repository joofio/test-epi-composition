<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to eflornithine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Vaniqa. </p>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor of any other medical problems you may be experiencing (especially related to 
your kidneys or liver).  </li>
<li>if you are unsure whether or not to use this medicine, contact your doctor or pharmacist for 
advice. </li>
</ul>
<p>Excessive growth of hair may be a result of underlying diseases. Talk to your doctor if you suffer from 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or specific hormone producing tumours, or if you take medicines 
that can induce hair growth, e.g. cyclosporine (following organ transplants), glucocorticoids (e.g. 
against rheumatic or allergic diseases), minoxidil (against high blood pressure), phenobarbitone 
(against seizures), phenytoin (against seizures) or hormone replacement therapy with male hormone 
like effects. 
Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Vaniqa is not recommended for use in anyone younger than 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vaniqa </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you need to use other medicines on the areas of skin where you are using the 
cream. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not use Vaniqa if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. You should use an alternative method to 
manage your facial hair if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Vaniqa is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Vaniqa contains cetostearyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. 
contact dermatitis). Vaniqa also contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E216) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). </p>         </div>"""

you are not sure. 
* Use twice a day, at least 8 hours apart. 
* If you experience irritation (e.g. stinging burning), reduce the use of Vaniqa to once 
daily until the irritation has gone. If it persists contact your doctor. 
* If you have just shaved or used any other hair removal method, wait at least 5 minutes 
before using Vaniqa. It may sting or burn if you put this cream on cut or irritated skin. 
* Clean and dry the areas of the skin where you will be using the cream. 
* Apply a thin layer of cream and rub it in thoroughly until no visual residual product 
remains on the treated areas. 
* If possible, do not wash these areas of skin for 4 hours after applying the cream 
* Wash your hands after applying the cream. 
* Wait at least 5 minutes before using make-up or sunscreen on the same areas. 
* When using on the face, avoid contact with your eyes or the inside of your nose or 
mouth. If you should accidentally get Vaniqa into your eyes, mouth or nose, rinse well 
with water. </p>
<p>Vaniqa is not a depilatory cream, so you may need to continue with your hair removal method, for 
example by shaving or plucking. </p>
<p>It may take 8 weeks before you see results. It is important to continue using the cream. If you do not 
see any improvement after using it for 4 months contact your doctor. If you stop using it your original 
hair growth may return within 8 weeks. </p>
<p>If you use more Vaniqa than you should </p>
<p>If you put too much cream on your skin, it is unlikely to harm you. </p>
