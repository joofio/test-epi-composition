vaccine is used for protection from cholera in adults and children aged 2 years and older. The vaccine 
must be taken at least 10 days before travelling to a cholera-affected area. 
How Vaxchora works 
Vaxchora prepares the immune system (the body's defences) to defend itself against cholera. When a 
person takes the vaccine, the immune system makes proteins called antibodies against the cholera 
bacterium and its toxin (harmful substance) that causes diarrhoea. In this way the immune system is 
ready to fight cholera bacteria if the person comes into contact with it.  </p>         </div>"""

<p>if you have a weakened immune system, for example, if you were born with a weakened
immune system or if you are having treatments such as high-dose corticosteroid treatment,
cancer medicines or radiotherapy that can weaken the immune system.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Vaxchora. 
Not everyone taking Vaxchora will be fully protected against cholera. It is important to continue to 
follow hygiene advice and take special care with food and water in cholera-affected areas. 
Vaxchora may be less effective if you have HIV. 
Bacteria from the vaccine may be present in your stool for at least 7 days after you take the vaccine. 
To prevent any contamination, wash your hands thoroughly after visiting the toilet, changing nappies 
and before preparing food for at least 14 days after you take Vaxchora. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this vaccine to children younger than 2 years of age because it is not known how well it 
works in this age group. 
Other medicines and Vaxchora 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines or vaccines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal 
medicines. This is because Vaxchora can affect the way some other medicines and vaccines work.<br />
In particular tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking: </p>
<p>antibiotics   Vaxchora may not work if you take it while you are also taking antibiotics. Take
Vaxchora no earlier than 14 days after the last dose of an antibiotic. Avoid antibiotics for days after taking Vaxchora.</p>
<p>chloroquine for malaria prevention   Vaxchora may not work if you take it while you are also
taking chloroquine. Take Vaxchora at least 10 days before starting chloroquine or 14 days after
taking chloroquine.</p>
<p>the typhoid vaccine Ty21a   Vaxchora may not work if it is taken at the same time as Ty21a.
You should take Vaxchora at least 2 hours before or after taking Ty21a.
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vaxchora. 
Vaxchora with food and drink 
You must not eat or drink for 60 minutes before and after taking Vaxchora as this may reduce the 
vaccine s effectiveness. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Vaxchora is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any 
machines if you are feeling unwell. 
Vaxchora contains lactose, sucrose, and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product. 
This vaccine contains 863 mg of sodium (the main component of cooking/table salt) per dose.  This is 
equivalent to 43% of the recommended daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Please take this 
into account if you are on a controlled sodium diet. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this vaccine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is the contents of both sachets in the carton. However for children 2 to less 
than 6 years old take note of Step 8 in the instructions on how to prepare the vaccine, shown below. 
Protection against cholera is established within 10 days after taking Vaxchora. Your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse will tell you how soon before travelling to take the vaccine. 
Instructions: 
PREPARE THIS VACCINE EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED IN THIS LEAFLET 
Please read the following before you begin: 
Vaxchora may not work if the following occurs:  </p>
<p>Incorrect storage; the vaccine must be stored in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Using the incorrect amount of water; 100 mL must be used.</p>
<p>Using the incorrect type of water; bottled water that is cold or room temperature and non-
carbonated or carbonated must be used.</p>
<p>Mixing the sachets in the wrong order; sachet 1 must be added to the water first. If the sachets
are mixed in the wrong order you must discard the vaccine and request a replacement dose.</p>
<p>Eating or drinking; must be avoided 60 minutes before and after taking the vaccine, eating or
drinking can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.
Do not touch your eyes when you prepare the vaccine to avoid contamination. 
If any powder or liquid gets spilt, clean the surface with hot water and soap or an antibacterial 
disinfectant. 
If there is a significant spill (more than a few drops of liquid or grains of powder), dispose of the 
vaccine and get a new one from your doctor or pharmacist; DO NOT take the remaining medication. 
Step 1 
Gather materials: </p>
<p>Clean cup</p>
<p>Utensil to stir</p>
<p>Bottled water (non-carbonated or
carbonated, cold or room
temperature, 25 C or less)</p>
<p>Item to measure 100 mL of bottled
water (e.g. measuring jug)</p>
<p>Scissors
Step 2 
Remove the vaccine from the refrigerator. 
Step 3 
Locate the two sachets: the sachets are 
labelled 1 and 2. Sachet 1 contains  Sodium hydrogen 
carbonate effervescent powder  (buffer) and 
is black and white. Sachet 2 contains 
 Vaxchora  Active ingredient  and is blue 
and white. 
If a sachet is not intact, do not use either 
sachet and contact your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about acquiring a replacement dose; 
using a sachet that is not intact can reduce the 
effectiveness of the vaccine.. 
Step 4 
Measure 100 mL of bottled cold or room 
temperature non-carbonated or carbonated 
water and pour into a clean cup. 
Using bottled water is necessary for the 
vaccine to be effective  using non-bottled 
(e.g. tap water) may render the vaccine 
ineffective. 
Step 5 
Use scissors to cut off the top of sachet 1. Do not put your fingers into the sachet. Wash 
your hands if you touch the sachet contents, 
in order to reduce the chance of 
contamination. 
Step 6 
Empty the contents of sachet 1 into the water 
in the cup. It will fizz. 
Step 7 
Stir until the powder completely dissolves. 
Step 8 
For children age 2 to &lt;6 years only:<br />
Pour away and discard half of the buffer 
solution. (Note: For children over 6 years and 
adults this step is NOT required) 
Step 9 
Use scissors to cut off the top of sachet 2. Do not put your fingers into the sachet. Wash 
your hands if you touch the sachet contents, 
in order to reduce the chance of 
contamination.<br />
Step Empty the contents of sachet 2 into the cup. 
Step Stir for at least 30 seconds. The powder from 
sachet 2 may not dissolve completely. It will 
form a slightly cloudy mixture with some 
white particles. 
If desired, after stirring in sachet 2 for at least 
30 seconds, stevia sweetener (no more than 1 
gram or   teaspoon) or sugar (sucrose, not 
more than 4 grams or 1 teaspoon) may be 
added, and then stirred into the suspension. 
DO NOT add other sweeteners as this may 
reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. 
Step Drink the full contents of the cup within minutes of preparing it. Some residue may 
remain in the cup and must be discarded.  If 
you or your child take less than half of the 
dose, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or 
nurse right away about the need for a repeat 
dose. 
Step Dispose of the empty sachets according to 
local biosafety guidelines. 
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse how to 
throw away medicine waste material. 
Step If a spill occurs while stirring or drinking the 
medication, or there is any residue (powder 
or liquid left behind from a stirring utensil, 
cup, or other object) on the mixing surface, 
clean up spilled material or residue 
preferably with a disposable paper 
towel/cloth using hot water and soap or 
antibacterial disinfectant. Discard the paper 
towel together with the sachets (see above). 
Step Wash the cup and spoon or stirrer with soap 
and hot water. <br />
Step Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot 
water to prevent contamination. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
