B, poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Vaxelis is given to
children from the age of six weeks.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria
and viruses that cause the following diseases:
* Diphtheria: a bacterial infection that usually first affects the throat, causing pain and swelling
which can lead to suffocation. The bacteria also make a toxin (poison) that can damage the
heart, kidneys and nerves.
* Tetanus (often called lock jaw): caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. The
bacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to breathe
and the possibility of suffocation.
* Pertussis (often called whooping cough): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It
causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a
 whooping  sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can
also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung
infections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death.
* Hepatitis B: caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). In
some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time, and can eventually lead to serious
liver problems, including liver cancer.
* Poliomyelitis (often just called polio): caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to
paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control
breathing and swallowing can be fatal.
* Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib infections): serious bacterial
infections causing meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead
to brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation
and swelling of the throat, leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing, and infection can
affect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints.
Important information about the protection provided
* Vaxelis will only help to prevent these diseases caused by the bacteria and viruses targeted by
the vaccine. Vaxelis does not protect your child against diseases caused by other bacteria and
viruses that may cause similar symptoms.
* The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the
infectious diseases against which it protects.</p>
<p>As with any vaccine, Vaxelis may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine.</p>         </div>"""

of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor,
pharmacist or nurse to explain.
Do not use Vaxelis if your child:
* has had shortness of breath or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration of
a previous dose of Vaxelis.
* is allergic (hypersensitive)</p>
<p>to Vaxelis vaccine or any diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B or Hib
containing vaccines,</p>
<p>to any ingredients listed in section 6,</p>
<p>to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B (antibiotics) and
bovine serum albumin, as these substances are used during the manufacturing process.
* has suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior
dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis).
* has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system
(uncontrolled neurologic disorder) or uncontrolled epilepsy.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child:
* has a moderate to severe acute disease, with or without fever (e.g. sore throat, cough, cold or
flu). Vaccination with Vaxelis may need to be delayed until your child is better.
* has had any of the following events after receiving a vaccine against pertussis (whooping
cough), as the decision to give further doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be
carefully considered:</p>
<p>had a fever of 40.5 C or above within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause.</p>
<p>became floppy, unresponsive or unconscious after the previous vaccination, within hours of vaccination.</p>
<p>cried continuously and could not be comforted for more than 3 hours within 48 hours of
vaccination.</p>
<p>had a fit (convulsions) with or without fever, within 3 days of vaccination.
* previously had Guillain-Barr  syndrome (temporary loss of feeling and movement) after being
given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of tetanus toxin). Your doctor
will decide whether to give Vaxelis to your child.
* is receiving a treatment (such as steroids, chemotherapy or radiotherapy) or has a disease that
suppresses or weakens the body s ability to fight infections. It is recommended to postpone
vaccination until the end of such treatment or disease. However, children with long standing
problems with their immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Vaxelis
but the protection may not be as good as in children with a healthy immune system.
* suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. Your
doctor or nurse will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination, once the condition is
stabilised.
* suffers from fits during a fever, or there is family history of fits occurring during a fever.
* has any problems with bleeding for a long time after minor cuts, or bruises easily. Your doctor
will advise you whether your child should receive Vaxelis. 
* was born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation). In these infants, longer gaps
than normal between breaths may occur for 2 to 3 days after vaccination.
Other medicines or vaccines and Vaxelis
Tell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking or has recently taken or might take any other
medicines or vaccines.
Vaxelis can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles-
mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, or meningococcal B or C vaccines.
Your doctor or nurse will give these injections at different sites and will use different syringes and
needles for each injection.
Driving and using machines
It is expected that Vaxelis will have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use
machines.
Vaxelis contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .</p>         </div>"""

side effects).
Your doctor or nurse will inject Vaxelis into your child s thigh (in infants from the age of 6 weeks) or
arm (in children older than one year).
The recommended dose is as follows:
First course of vaccination (primary vaccination)
Your child will receive two or three injections given at least one month apart. Your doctor or nurse will
tell you when your child should come back for their next injection as per the local vaccination
program.
Additional injection (booster)
After the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local
recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you
when this dose should be given.
If your child misses a dose of Vaxelis
If your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse
who will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that your child completes the
course of injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases.
