Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you or your child receives Vaxneuvance if:
* the immune system is weak (which means the body is less able to fight off infections) or if you
or your child is taking certain medicines that may make the immune system weak (for example,
immunosuppressants or steroids).
* you or your child has a high fever or severe infection. In these cases, the vaccination may have
to be postponed until you or your child has recovered. However, a mild fever or infection (for
example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
* you or your child has any bleeding problems, bruises easily, or is taking medicines to prevent
blood clots.
37
If your child is an infant, also tell your doctor if your child was born prematurely (too early). 
As with any vaccine, Vaxneuvance may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.
Other medicines/vaccines and Vaxneuvance
Your child can be given Vaxneuvance at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines.
In adults, Vaxneuvance can be given at the same time as the flu (inactivated influenza) vaccine.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if:
* you or your child is taking, has recently taken, or might take any prescription medicines (for
example, immunosuppressants or steroids which may make the immune system weak) or any
medicines obtained without a prescription.
* you or your child has recently received or plan to receive any other vaccine.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
Vaxneuvance has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some
of the effects mentioned under section 4 “Possible side effects” may temporarily affect the ability to
drive or use machines.
Vaxneuvance contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.</p>         </div>"""

pharmacist, or nurse for more information.
Premature infants (born earlier than 37 weeks of pregnancy)
Your child should receive an initial course of 3 injections of the vaccine followed by a booster dose. 
* The first injection may be given as early as 6 weeks of age.

doses. 
* A fourth injection (booster) will be given between 11 through 15 months of age.
38
Infants, children and adolescents starting the vaccination at 7 months of age or older
Infants 7 to less than 12 months of age should receive a total of 3 injections. The first two injections
will be given at least 1 month apart. The third injection (booster) will be given after 12 months of age

Special populations
One or more injections of Vaxneuvance may be given to individuals who have one or more underlying
conditions that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease (such as individuals with sickle cell
disease or living with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or recipients of a stem cell transplant).

The active substances are:
- bacterial sugars from pneumococcus types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F,
and 33F (2.0 micrograms of each type);
- bacterial sugar from pneumococcus type 6B (4.0 micrograms).
Each bacterial sugar is linked to a carrier protein (CRM197). The bacterial sugars and the carrier protein
are not alive and do not cause disease.
One dose (0.5 mL) contains approximately 30 micrograms carrier protein, adsorbed on aluminium
phosphate (125 micrograms aluminium [Al3+]). Aluminium phosphate is included in the vaccine as an
adjuvant. Adjuvants are included to improve the immune responses of vaccines.
The other ingredients are sodium chloride (NaCl), L-histidine, polysorbate 20, and water for
injections.
What Vaxneuvance looks like and contents of the pack
Vaxneuvance is an opalescent suspension for injection, provided in a single-dose, pre-filled syringe
(0.5 mL). Vaxneuvance is available in pack sizes of 1 or 10, either without needles, with 1 separate
needle, or with 2 separate needles.
Vaxneuvance is also available in multipacks comprising 5 cartons, each containing 10 pre-filled
syringes without needles.

&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Vaxneuvance must not be injected intravascularly.
* Immediately prior to use, hold the pre-filled syringe horizontally and shake vigorously to obtain
an opalescent suspension. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended.
* Inspect the suspension visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.
Discard the vaccine if particulates are present and/or if it appears discoloured.
* Attach a needle with Luer lock connection by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle
fits securely on the syringe.
* Inject immediately using the intramuscular (IM) route, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of
the thigh in infants or in the deltoid area of the upper arm in children and adults.
* Exercise care to avoid harm from an accidental needle stick.
No data are available for administration via the intradermal route.
Vaxneuvance must not be mixed with any other vaccines in the same syringe.
Vaxneuvance can be given concomitantly with other routine childhood vaccines.
Vaxneuvance can be administered concomitantly with seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (split
virion, inactivated) in adults. 
Different injectable vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites.
Store in a refrigerator (2 ℃– 8 ℃). Do not freeze.
Keep the pre-filled syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light.
Vaxneuvance should be administered as soon as possible after being removed from the refrigerator.
In the event of temporary temperature excursions, stability data indicate that Vaxneuvance is stable at
temperatures up to 25 ℃  for 48 hours.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local
requirements.</p>         </div>"""
