<p>If you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in 
section 6).
-
If you have had a blood clot occurring at the same time as having low levels of blood platelets 
(thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, TTS) after receiving Vaxzevria.
-
If you have a previous diagnosis of capillary leak syndrome (a condition causing fluid leakage 
from small blood vessels).
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Vaxzevria:
-
If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you 
were given Vaxzevria in the past.
-
If you have ever fainted following any needle injection.
-
If you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 C). However, you can have 
your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.
-
If you have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you are taking an anticoagulant medicine 
(to prevent blood clots).
-
If your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines 
that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or 
cancer medicines).
-
If you previously had Guillain-Barr  syndrome (temporary loss of feeling and movement) after 
being given Vaxzevria.
-
If you previously had transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) after being given 
Vaxzevria.
-
If you have risk factors for blood clots in your veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)).
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given the vaccine.
As with any vaccine, the 2-dose vaccination course of Vaxzevria may not fully protect all those who 
receive it. It is not known how long you will be protected for.
Blood disorders
Very rare blood clots in combination with low level of blood platelets, in some cases together with 
bleeding, has been observed following vaccination with Vaxzevria. This included some severe cases 
with blood clots in different or unusual locations (e.g., brain, bowel, liver, spleen) and excessive 
clotting or bleeding throughout the body. The majority of these cases occurred within the first three 
weeks following vaccination. Some cases had a fatal outcome. Fewer cases have been reported after 
the second dose compared to after the first dose.
Blood clots in the brain, not associated with low level of blood platelets have been observed very 
rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria. The majority of these cases occurred within the first four 
weeks following vaccination. Some cases had a fatal outcome.
Blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism (VTE)) have been observed following vaccination 
with Vaxzevria.
Very low levels of blood platelets (immune thrombocytopenia), that can be associated with bleeding, 
have been reported very rarely, usually within the first four weeks following vaccination with 
Vaxzevria.
Seek immediate medical attention if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain 
or persistent abdominal pain following vaccination (see section 4). 
Also, seek immediate medical attention if you experience after a few days following vaccination 
severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, confusion or seizures (fits) after vaccination, or 
experience unexplained bleeding or skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of 
vaccination which appears after a few days (see section 4).
Capillary leak syndrome
Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported following vaccination with 
Vaxzevria. Some affected patients had a previous diagnosis of CLS. CLS is a serious, potentially fatal 
condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the 
arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint (low blood pressure). Seek immediate medical 
attention if you develop these symptoms in the days following vaccination.
Neurological events
Guillain-Barr  syndrome (GBS):
Seek immediate medical attention if you develop weakness and paralysis in the extremities that can 
progress to the chest and face (Guillain-Barr  syndrome). This has been reported very rarely after 
vaccination with Vaxzevria.
Inflammation of the spinal cord (transverse myelitis, TM):
Seek immediate medical attention if you develop signs of weakness in the arms or legs, sensory 
symptoms (such as tingling, numbness, pain or loss of pain sensation) and urinary or bowel 
dysfunction. This has been reported very rarely after vaccination with Vaxzevria.
Risk of severe adverse events after a booster dose
The risk of severe adverse events (such as blood disorders including thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome, VTE, CLS, GBS, TM) after a booster dose of Vaxzevria is unknown.
Children and adolescents
Vaxzevria is not recommended for children aged below 18 years. Currently there is not enough 
information available on the use of Vaxzevria in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of 
age.
Other medicines and Vaxzevria
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take, any other 
medicines or vaccines.
Pregnancy and breastfeeding
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
Some of the side effects of Vaxzevria listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily reduce
your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel unwell after vaccination, do not drive or use 
machines. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.
Vaxzevria contains sodium and alcohol (ethanol)
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .
This medicine contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) per 0.5 ml dose. The small amount of alcohol in this 
medicine will not have any noticeable effects.</p>         </div>"""

Primary vaccination course
You will receive 2 injections of Vaxzevria. The second injection can be given between 4 and 
12 weeks after the first injection. You will be told when you need to return for your second injection.
