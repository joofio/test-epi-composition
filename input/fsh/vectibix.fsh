with a certain type of tumour known as a  Wild-type RAS tumour . Vectibix is used alone or in 
combination with other anti-cancer medicines. </p>
<p>Vectibix contains the active substance panitumumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins, which specifically recognise and attach 
(bind) to other unique proteins in the body. </p>
<p>Panitumumab recognises and binds specifically to a protein known as epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR), which is found on the surface of some cancer cells. When growth factors (other 
body proteins) attach to the EGFR, the cancer cell is stimulated to grow and divide. Panitumumab 
binds onto the EGFR and prevents the cancer cell from receiving the messages it needs for growth and 
division. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to panitumumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you have previously had or have evidence of interstitial pneumonitis (swelling of the lungs 
causing coughing and difficulty breathing) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring and thickening in the 
lungs with shortness of breath). </li>
<li>in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, if your RAS test shows that you have 
mutant RAS tumour, or if your RAS tumour status is unknown. Please consult your doctor if you 
are unsure of your RAS tumour status. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>You may experience skin reactions or severe swelling and tissue damage, if these worsen or become 
intolerable please tell your doctor or nurse immediately. If you experience a severe skin reaction, your 
doctor may recommend an adjustment of the dose of Vectibix. If you develop a severe infection or 
fever as a result of skin reactions, your doctor may stop your treatment with Vectibix. </p>
<p>It is recommended that you limit sun exposure whilst receiving Vectibix and if you are experiencing 
skin reactions as sunlight can worsen these. Wear sunscreen and a hat if you are going to be exposed 
to sunlight. Your doctor may ask you to use a moisturiser, sun screen (SPF &gt; 15), topical steroid, 
and/or oral antibiotics which may help in the management of skin toxicities that can be associated with 
the use of Vectibix. </p>
<p>Your doctor will check your blood levels of several substances such as magnesium, calcium and 
potassium in your blood before you start Vectibix treatment. Your doctor will also check your blood 
levels of magnesium and calcium periodically during your treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after you 
have finished your treatment. If these levels are too low, your doctor may prescribe you appropriate 
supplements. </p>
<p>If you experience severe diarrhoea please tell your doctor or nurse since you may lose a lot of water 
from your body (become dehydrated) and this could damage your kidneys. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you use contact lenses and/or have a history of eye problems such as severe dry 
eye, inflammation of the front part of the eye (cornea) or ulcers involving the front part of the eye. </p>
<p>If you develop acute or worsening redness and pain in the eye, increased eye watering, blurred vision 
and/or sensitivity to light, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately as you may need urgent 
treatment (see  Possible side effects  below). </p>
<p>Based on your age (older than 65 years) or general health, your doctor will discuss with you your 
ability to tolerate taking Vectibix with your chemotherapy treatment. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vectibix </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Vectibix should not be used in combination with bevacizumab (another monoclonal antibody used in 
cancer of the bowel) or with a chemotherapy combination known as  IFL . </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>Vectibix has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant; 
think you may be pregnant; or plan to get pregnant. Vectibix could affect your unborn baby or ability 
to stay pregnant. </p>
<p>If you are a woman of child bearing potential, you should use effective methods of contraception 
during treatment with Vectibix and for 2 months after the last dose. </p>
<p>It is not recommended to breast-feed your baby during treatment with Vectibix and for 2 months after 
the last dose. It is important to tell your doctor if you plan to breast-feed. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>You should speak with your doctor before driving or using machines, as some side effects may impair 
your ability to do so safely. </p>
<p>Vectibix contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains 3.45 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each mL unit. This 
is equivalent to 0.17% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The most serious side effects and main side effects for Vectibix are listed below: </p>
<p>Infusion reactions </p>
<p>During or following treatment you may experience an infusion reaction. These can be mild or 
moderate (likely to occur in approximately 5 out of 100 people who take Vectibix), or severe (likely to 
occur in 1 out of 100 people who take Vectibix). Symptoms may include headache, rashes, itching or 
hives, flushing, swelling (face, lips, mouth, around the eyes, and throat area), rapid and irregular 
heartbeat, fast pulse, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or a 
decrease in blood pressure that may be severe or life-threatening and, very rarely, may lead to death. If 
you experience any of these symptoms, you should notify your doctor immediately. Your doctor may 
decide to reduce the rate of your infusion or discontinue your treatment with Vectibix. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions </p>
<p>Very rarely, serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions involving symptoms similar to an infusion 
reaction (see  Infusion reactions ) have occurred more than 24 hours after treatment and resulted in a 
fatal outcome. Seek medical attention immediately if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction 
to Vectibix, including but not limited to difficulty breathing, chest tightness, a sensation of choking, 
dizziness, or fainting. </p>
<p>Skin reactions </p>
<p>Skin-related reactions are likely to occur in approximately 94 out of 100 people who take Vectibix and 
are usually mild to moderate. The skin rash commonly resembles acne and often involves the face, 
upper chest and back, but can affect any area of the body. Some rashes have been associated with 
redness, itching and flaking of the skin which can become severe. In some cases, it may cause infected 
sores requiring medical and/or surgical treatment, or cause severe skin infections that in rare cases 
could be fatal. In rare cases patients may experience blistering of the skin, mouth, eyes and genitals, 
which may indicate a severe skin reaction called  Stevens-Johnson syndrome  or blistering of the 
skin, which may indicate a severe skin reaction called  toxic epidermal necrolysis . If you experience 
blistering, you should notify your doctor immediately. Prolonged exposure to the sun can make the 
rash worse. Also, dry skin, fissures (cracks in the skin) on the fingers or toes, fingernail bed or toenail 
bed infection (paronychia) or inflammation has been reported. Once treatment is withheld or 
discontinued, the skin reactions will generally resolve. Your doctor may decide to treat the rash, adjust 
the dose or discontinue your treatment with Vectibix. </p>
