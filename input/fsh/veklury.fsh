* if you are allergic to remdesivir, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
  Talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible, if this applies to you. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before starting on Veklury: 
* if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may monitor you if you have kidney problems to 
ensure your safety. 
* If you are immunocompromised. Your doctor may monitor you more closely if your immune 
system is not working properly to ensure the treatment is working. </p>
<p>Reactions following the infusion 
Veklury can cause allergic reactions following and during the infusion, including anaphylactic 
reactions (sudden life-threatening allergic reactions). Allergic reactions have been seen rarely. For 
anaphylactic reactions frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. Symptoms can include: 
* Changes to blood pressure or heart rate 
* Low oxygen level in blood 
* High temperature 
* Shortness of breath, wheezing 
* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) 
* Rash 
* Feeling sick (nausea) 
* Being sick (vomiting) 
* Sweating 
* Shivering </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of these effects. </p>
<p>Blood tests before and during treatment 
If you are prescribed Veklury, you may be given blood tests before treatment starts. Patients being 
treated with Veklury may have blood tests during their treatment as determined by their healthcare 
professional. These tests are to check for kidney problems. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Veklury is not to be given to children under 4 weeks old or to children who weigh less than 3 kg. Not 
enough is known for it to be given to these children. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Veklury 
Tell your doctor or nurse about any other medicines you are taking, or have recently taken. </p>
<p>Do not take chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at the same time as Veklury. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, or if you might be. There is not enough information 
to be sure that Veklury is safe for use in first trimester of pregnancy. Veklury should only be given if 
the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential of risks to the mother and the unborn child. 
Discuss with your doctor the need to use effective contraception during treatment with Veklury. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse if you are breast-feeding. Veklury passes into human breast milk in very 
small amounts. Because there is limited experience with use during breast-feeding, you should 
carefully discuss with your doctor whether to continue or interrupt breast-feeding during treatment 
with Veklury. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Veklury is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive. </p>
<p>Veklury contains a cyclodextrin 
This medicine contains 3 g betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium in each 100 mg dose of Veklury (6 g in 
the starting dose). This ingredient is a cyclodextrin emulsifier that helps the medicine to disperse in the 
body. </p>
<p>Veklury contains sodium 
This medicine contains 212 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 100 mg dose 
unit. This is equivalent to 10.6 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an 
adult. </p>         </div>"""
