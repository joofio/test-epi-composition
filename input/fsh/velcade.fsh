  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>VELCADE contains the active substance bortezomib, a so-called  proteasome inhibitor . Proteasomes 
play an important role in controlling cell function and growth. By interfering with their function, 
bortezomib can kill cancer cells.
VELCADE is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow) in patients 
older than 18 years:
-
alone or together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone, for 
patients whose disease is worsening (progressive) after receiving at least one prior treatment and 
for whom blood stem cell transplantation was not successful or is unsuitable.
-
in combination with the medicines melphalan and prednisone, for patients whose disease has 
not been previously treated and are unsuitable for high-dose chemotherapy with blood stem cell 
transplantation.
-
in combination with the medicines dexamethasone or dexamethasone together with thalidomide, 
for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and before receiving high-dose 
chemotherapy with blood stem cell transplantation (induction treatment).
VELCADE is used for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the lymph 
nodes) in patients 18 years or older in combination with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and prednisone, for patients whose disease has not been previously treated and for whom 
blood stem cell transplantation is unsuitable.</p>         </div>"""

serious brain infection and your doctor may suggest further testing and follow-up.
You will have to take regular blood tests before and during your treatment with VELCADE, to check 
your blood cell counts regularly.
If you have mantle cell lymphoma and are given the medicine rituximab with VELCADE you should 
tell your doctor:</p>
<p>if you think you have hepatitis infection now or have had it in the past. In a few cases, patients 
who have had hepatitis B might have a repeated attack of hepatitis, which can be fatal. If you 
have a history of hepatitis B infection you will be carefully checked by your doctor for signs of 
active hepatitis B.
You must read the package leaflets of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with 
VELCADE for information related to these medicines before starting treatment with VELCADE.
When thalidomide is used, particular attention to pregnancy testing and prevention requirements is 
needed (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding in this section).
Children and adolescents
VELCADE should not be used in children and adolescents because it is not known how the medicine 
will affect them.
Other medicines and VELCADE
Please tell your doctor, or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
In particular, tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following active 
substances:
-
ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections
ritonavir, used to treat HIV infection
-
rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections
-
carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital used to treat epilepsy
-
St. John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), used for depression or other conditions
-
oral antidiabetics
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not use VELCADE if you are pregnant, unless clearly necessary.
Both men and women receiving VELCADE must use effective contraception during and for up to 
3 months after treatment. If, despite these measures, pregnancy occurs, tell your doctor immediately.
You should not breast-feed while using VELCADE. Discuss with your doctor when it is safe to restart 
breast-feeding after finishing your treatment.
Thalidomide causes birth defects and foetal death. When VELCADE is given in combination with 
thalidomide you must follow the pregnancy prevention programme for thalidomide (see package 
leaflet for thalidomide).
Driving and using machines
VELCADE might cause tiredness, dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. Do not drive or operate tools 
or machines if you experience such side effects; even if you do not, you should still be cautious.</p>         </div>"""

area). The usual starting dose of VELCADE is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice a week.
Your doctor may change the dose and total number of treatment cycles, depending on your response to 
the treatment on the occurrence of certain side effects and on your underlying conditions (e.g. liver 
problems).
Progressive multiple myeloma
When VELCADE is given alone, you will receive 4 doses of VELCADE intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 
and 11, followed by a 10-day  rest period  without treatment. This 21-day period (3 weeks)
corresponds to one treatment cycle. You might receive up to 8 cycles (24 weeks).
You may also be given VELCADE together with the medicines pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or
dexamethasone.
When VELCADE is given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, you will receive 
VELCADE intravenously as a 21-day treatment cycle and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 
is given on day 4 of the VELCADE 21-day treatment cycle as an intravenous infusion after the 
VELCADE injection.

Previously untreated multiple myeloma
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are not suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive VELCADE intravenously together with two other medicines; 
melphalan and prednisone.
In this case, the duration of a treatment cycle is 42 days (6 weeks). You will receive 9 cycles 
(54 weeks).</p>
<p>In cycles 1 to 4, VELCADE is administered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32.<br />
In cycles 5 to 9, VELCADE is administered once weekly on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. Melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) are both given orally on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the 
first week of each cycle.
If you have not been treated before for multiple myeloma, and you are suitable for blood stem cell 
transplantation you will receive VELCADE intravenously together with the medicines 
dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and thalidomide, as induction treatment.
When VELCADE is given together with dexamethasone, you will receive VELCADE intravenously 
as a 21-day treatment cycle and dexamethasone 40 mg is given orally on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and

tolerated the thalidomide dose is increased to 100 mg on days 15-28 and may be further increased to 
200 mg daily from the second cycle onwards.
You might receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks).
Previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma
If you have not been treated before for mantle cell lymphoma you will receive VELCADE 
intravenously together with the medicines rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone.
VELCADE is given intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a  rest period  without 
treatment. The duration of a treatment cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). You might receive up to 8 cycles 
(24 weeks).

How VELCADE is given
This medicine is for intravenous use only. VELCADE will be administered by a health care 
professional experienced in the use of cytotoxic medicines.
VELCADE powder has to be dissolved before administration. This will be done by a healthcare 
professional. The resulting solution is then injected into a vein rapidly, over 3 to 5 seconds.
If you are given too much VELCADE
As this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much.
In the unlikely event of an overdose, your doctor will monitor you for side effects.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of 
these effects may be serious.
If you are given VELCADE for multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma, tell your doctor straight 
away if you notice any of the following symptoms:
-
muscle cramping, muscle weakness
-
confusion, visual loss or disturbances, blindness, seizures, headaches
-
shortness of breath, swelling of your feet or changes in your heart beat, high blood pressure, 
tiredness, fainting
-
coughing and breathing difficulties or tightness in the chest.
Treatment with VELCADE can very commonly cause a decrease in the numbers of red and white 
blood cells and platelets in your blood. Therefore, you will have to take regular blood tests before and 
during your treatment with VELCADE, to check your blood cell counts regularly. You may 
experience a reduction in the number of:
-
platelets, which may make you be more prone to bruising, or to bleeding without obvious injury 
(e.g., bleeding from your bowels, stomach, mouth and gum or bleeding in the brain or bleeding 
from the liver)
-
red blood cells, which can cause anaemia, with symptoms such as tiredness and paleness
-
white blood cells may make you more prone to infections or flu-like symptoms.
