sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators.  </p>
<p>Velsipity is used in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large bowel. 
If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough or cannot take these medicines, you may be given Velsipity to reduce the signs and symptoms 
of the disease. </p>
<p>The active substance in Velsipity, etrasimod, prevents lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) from 
travelling from the lymph nodes (part of the body’s immune system that contains lymphocytes) into 
the blood. These lymphocytes are involved in the inflammation that is linked to the development of 
ulcerative colitis. By reducing the number of lymphocytes circulating in the blood surrounding the 
large bowel, etrasimod helps to reduce bowel inflammation and the symptoms associated with the 
disease.  </p>         </div>"""

the last 6 months;

of the liver) or tuberculosis; 
* if you have cancer;<br />
</em> if you have severe liver problems; 
* if you are pregnant or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or, pharmacist before taking Velsipity if: 
* you have a slow heart rate or you are taking or have recently taken medicines that slow your 
heart rate (such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers); 
* you have ever had a stroke or other diseases related to blood vessels in the brain; 
* you have problems with your liver; 
* you have an infection; 
* you have low levels of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell); 
* you have recently had or are planning to have a vaccination; 
* you have ever had problems with your vision or other symptoms of build-up of fluid in the back 
of the eye; 
* you have inflammation of the eye; 
* you have diabetes (which can cause problems with your eyes); 
* you have high blood pressure; 
* you have severe lung disease, such as pulmonary fibrosis (lung damage with tissue scarring and 
thickening), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a type of lung disease marked by 
permanent damage to lung tissues). </p>
<p>Slow heart rate and irregular heart rhythm 
Before you start taking Velsipity, your doctor will check your heart using an electrocardiogram (ECG; 
a test of the heart’s electrical activity). This is because Velsipity can cause a temporary decrease in 
heart rate and other heart rhythm disorders when starting treatment. When this happens, you may feel 
dizzy or tired or be consciously aware of your heartbeat, or your blood pressure may drop. If these 
effects are severe, tell your doctor, because you may need treatment right away. If you restart 
treatment again after stopping for 7 or more days in a row, your doctor may re-check your heart using 
an ECG. </p>
<p>If you have certain heart conditions, your doctor will also monitor you for at least the first 4 hours 
after your first dose. Your doctor will ask you to stay at the hospital or clinic for 4 hours and will 
measure your pulse and blood pressure every hour after taking the first dose of Velsipity. You should 
have an ECG performed before the first dose of Velsipity and after the 4-hour monitoring period. If 
after the 4-hour period you have a very slow or decreasing heart rate, or if your ECG shows 
abnormalities, you may need to be monitored for a longer period until these have resolved. </p>
<p>High blood pressure 
As Velsipity can increase your blood pressure, your doctor may want to check your blood pressure 
regularly. </p>
<p>Infections 
Velsipity lowers the levels of white blood cell in your blood (particularly the lymphocyte count). 
White blood cells fight infection. While you are taking Velsipity (and for up to about 2 weeks after 
you stop taking it), you may be more likely to get infections, and any infection that you already have 
may get worse. Talk to your doctor if you develop an infection. If you think you have an infection, 
have a fever, feel like you have the flu, have shingles or have a headache accompanied by a stiff neck, 
with sensitivity to light, nausea, rash, and/or confusion or seizures (fits) (these may be symptoms of 
meningitis and/or encephalitis caused by a fungal or herpes viral infection), contact your doctor 
straight away, because it could be serious and life-threatening. </p>
<p>Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported with medicines 
similar to Velsipity. PML is a rare viral brain infection that may lead to severe disability or death. 
PML symptoms include disturbance of vision, progressive weakness, clumsiness, memory loss or 
confusion. If you develop any of these symptoms, speak to your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
consider performing further tests to evaluate this condition and will stop your treatment with Velsipity 
if PML is confirmed. </p>
<p>Macular oedema 
Velsipity can cause a problem with your vision called macular oedema (swelling of the macula, the 
central part of the retina at the back of the eye). Your doctor will check your vision around the time 
you start taking Velsipity and at any time you notice vision changes during your treatment. Tell your 
doctor about any changes in your vision. The risk of developing macular oedema is higher if you have 
diabetes, uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the layer beneath the white of the eyeball), or certain other 
eye problems. If you have any of these conditions, your doctor will check your vision around the time 
you start taking Velsipity and regularly during treatment.  </p>
<p>Call your doctor straight away if you have any of the following: 
* blurriness or shadows in the centre of your vision; 
* a blind spot in the centre of your vision; 
* sensitivity to light; 
* unusually coloured (tinted) vision. </p>
<p>Cancer 
Velsipity weakens your immune system. This increases your risk of developing cancers, in particular 
skin cancers. Skin cancers have been reported with medicines similar to Velsipity. Talk to your doctor 
straight away if you notice any skin nodules (e.g., shiny pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do 
not heal within weeks. Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin 
tissue (e.g., unusual moles) with a change in colour, shape, or size over time. Since there is a risk for 
skin cancer, you should limit your exposure to sunlight and UV (ultraviolet) light by wearing 
protective clothing and regularly applying sunscreen (with high sun protection factor).  </p>
<p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a condition where the brain swells. PRES 
symptoms include headache, changes in vision, reduced awareness, confusion, and seizures (fits). If 
you develop any of these symptoms, speak to your doctor straight away. </p>
<p>Vaccinations 
If you need to receive a vaccine, seek your doctor’s advice first. Vaccines may not work as well as 
they should during your treatment with Velsipity. You are advised to make sure your vaccinations are 
up-to-date before you start treatment. So-called live vaccines may trigger the infection that they are 
supposed to prevent and should therefore be given at least 4 weeks before you start treatment, or at 
least 2 weeks after you stop taking Velsipity.  </p>
<p>Liver function tests 
Velsipity may affect your liver function. Tell your doctor straight away if you develop any of the 
following symptoms: yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, abnormally dark urine (brown 
coloured), pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen), tiredness, feeling less hungry than 
usual or unexplained nausea and vomiting.  </p>
<p>Before, during and after the treatment, your doctor will request blood tests to monitor your liver 
function. </p>
<p>Lung problems 
Velsipity may have an effect on the lung function. Patients with severe lung problems have a higher 
chance of developing these side effects. </p>
<p>Other treatments for ulcerative colitis 
Your doctor will usually advise that you stop other treatments for ulcerative colitis with the exception 
of corticosteroids (like cortisone), and mesalazine. Some medicines for ulcerative colitis may also be 
used for other conditions. Tell your doctor about all other medicines you take. When switching from 
the previous treatment, because of the risk of additive immunosuppressive effects, the risk of infection 
may be increased for some time. Do not take any other immunosuppressive products unless your 
doctor has told you to do so. </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential 
If used during pregnancy, Velsipity can harm the unborn baby. Before you start treatment with 
Velsipity, your doctor will explain the risk to you and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure 
that you are not pregnant. Your doctor will give you a patient card which explains why you should not 
become pregnant while taking Velsipity. It also explains what you should do to avoid becoming 
pregnant while you are taking Velsipity. You must use effective contraception during treatment and 
for at least 14 days after stopping treatment (see “Pregnancy, contraception, and breast-feeding” in 
section 2). </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Velsipity. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents aged under 16 years. This is because Velsipity 
has not been studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Velsipity 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Velsipity can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other 
medicines can affect the way Velsipity works. </p>
<p>In particular, before taking Velsipity, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently 
taken any of the following medicines: 
* Medicines to control your heart rate and blood pressure (beta blocker medicines and calcium 
channel blocker medicines); use of these medicines could strengthen the effect of Velsipity on 
irregular heartbeat. 
* Medicines to control your heart rhythm (antiarrhythmics), or heartbeat.<br />
<em> Medicines that affect your immune system; use of these medicines with Velsipity could weaken 
the immune system. 
* Vaccines; if you need to receive a vaccine, talk to your doctor. You should not take Velsipity 
for at least 2 weeks before a vaccination. You should not take Velsipity for at least 4 weeks after 
receiving a live vaccine.<br />
</em> Fluconazole (an anti-fungal treatment) and certain other medicines can increase the levels of 
Velsipity in the blood, which increases the risk of side effects with Velsipity. It is recommended 
that you do not take these while also taking Velsipity and your doctor will advise you on this. 
* Rifampicin, enzalutamide, and certain other medicines can decrease the levels of Velsipity in 
the blood, reducing its effectiveness. It is recommended that you do not take these while also 
taking Velsipity and your doctor will advise you on this. </p>
<p>Velsipity may slightly increase the levels of hormones released from some contraceptive pills. You 
will still be protected from pregnancy, but your chances of side effects from contraceptive pills may be 
higher. If you have any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, contraception, and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and contraception 
Do not use Velsipity during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant, or if you are a woman 
who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. If Velsipity is used during 
pregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. If you are a woman who could become 
pregnant, your doctor will inform you about this risk before you start treatment with Velsipity and will 
ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective 
contraception while taking Velsipity and for at least 14 days after you stop taking it. Ask your doctor 
about reliable methods of contraception. </p>
<p>Your doctor will give you a patient card which explains why you should not become pregnant while 
taking Velsipity. </p>
<p>If you do become pregnant while taking Velsipity, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
likely stop treatment (see “If you stop taking Velsipity” in section 3) and pre-natal checks will be 
performed to monitor the health of the unborn baby. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed while you are taking Velsipity. This is to avoid a risk of side effects for the 
baby since Velsipity may pass into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Velsipity is not expected to have an influence on your ability to drive and use machines. You may, 
however, feel dizzy after taking Velsipity. If this happens, do not drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Velsipity contains tartrazine (E102) 
The colouring agent in Velsipity contains tartrazine (E102), which may cause allergic reactions.  </p>
<p>Velsipity contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""
