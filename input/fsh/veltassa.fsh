<p>This medicine is used to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with high levels of potassium 
in their blood. </p>
<p>Too much potassium in the blood can affect how nerves control muscles. This can lead to weakness or 
even paralysis. High potassium levels can also result in an abnormal heartbeat, which can cause 
serious effects on your or your child s heart rhythm. </p>
<p>This medicine works by attaching to potassium in the gut. This prevents potassium from entering the 
bloodstream and lowers potassium levels in blood back to normal. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Other medicines and Veltassa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any

<p>This medicine is administered once daily. The recommended starting dose of this medicine varies with 
age. Multiple sachets may be used to achieve the desired dose. Your doctor may adjust the daily dose 
depending on the potassium level in your or your child s blood, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g daily. </p>
<p>Adults<br />
Starting dose: 8.4 g patiromer (the content of one 8.4 g sachet) once daily. </p>
<p>Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 
Starting dose: 4 g patiromer (the content of four 1 g sachets) once daily. Switch to 8.4 g patiromer 
sachets if doses above 7 g are needed. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide on the duration of the treatment based on the potassium level in blood. </p>
<p>Use this medicine at least 3 hours before or after other medicines taken by mouth unless your doctor or 
pharmacist gives you different advice. </p>
<p>Method of administration 
Before you take this medicine, it needs to be mixed with water as described below. The volume of 
water depends on your dose: 
* 1 g patiromer: 10 mL (2 teaspoons) 
* 2 g patiromer: 20 mL (4 teaspoons) 
* 3 g patiromer: 30 mL(6 teaspoons) 
* 4 g patiromer: 40 mL (3 tablespoons) 
* Above 4 g patiromer: 80 mL (6 tablespoons) </p>
<p>Prepare the mixture according to the following steps: 
* Pour half of the water in a glass, add the required number of Veltassa sachets and stir. 
* Add the remaining half of the water and stir thoroughly. The powder does not dissolve but 
forms a suspension, which might feel grainy. 
* You may add more water to the mixture to help you swallow the medicine. Please note that with 
larger volumes the powder might settle down more quickly. 
* Drink the mixture within 1 hour after preparation. If powder remains in the glass after drinking, 
add more water, stir and drink immediately. You may need to do this again to make sure that 
you have taken all the powder. </p>
<p>If you like, you can use the following liquids or soft foods instead of water to prepare the mixture by 
following the same steps as described above: apple juice, cranberry juice, pineapple juice, orange 
juice, grape juice, pear juice, apricot nectar, peach nectar, yoghurt, milk, thickener (for example: 
cornstarch), apple sauce, vanilla and chocolate pudding.  </p>
<p>When using such liquids and soft foods, follow your or your child s dietary recommendations on 
potassium intake. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>You should drink only moderate amounts (less than 400 mL per day) of cranberry juice as it can affect 
other medicines. </p>
<p>Use the prepared Veltassa suspension with or without meals, preferably at the same time each day. 
Never heat this medicine or add it to heated foods or liquids. 
Do not take this medicine as a dry powder. </p>
<p>If you use a nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, follow the steps described 
above to prepare the suspension for oral administration. For doses up to 8.4 g patiromer, use the 
volume as described above. For doses above 8.4 g and up to16.8 g patiromer use a total volume of mL (12 tablespoons) and for doses above 16.8 g and up to 25.2 g patiromer use a total volume of mL (18 tablespoons). These volumes ensure that the suspension readily flows through the tubes.  </p>
<p>Tubes made from polyurethane, silicone, and polyvinyl chloride may be used. The recommended 
diameter of tubes is 2.17 mm (6.5 Fr) or larger. After administration of the suspension, the tube should 
be flushed with water. Follow tube manufacturer s instructions. </p>
<p>If you take more Veltassa than you should 
Stop using this medicine and talk to your doctor or pharmacist immediately. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Veltassa 
If you or your child have missed a dose, take it as soon as possible on the same day. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you miss more than one dose, contact your doctor. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Veltassa 
Do not stop using this medicine without your doctor s approval, as the potassium blood level may 
increase. </p>         </div>"""
