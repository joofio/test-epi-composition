Venclyxto is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance venetoclax. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called  BCL-2 inhibitors .
What Venclyxto is used for
Venclyxto is used to treat adults with:</p>
<p>chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Venclyxto may be given to you in combination with 
other medicines or alone.</p>
<p>acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Venclyxto will be given in combination with other 
medicines.
CLL is a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called lymphocytes and the lymph nodes. In CLL, 
the lymphocytes multiply too quickly and live for too long, so that there are too many of them in the 
blood.
AML is a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called myeloid cells. In AML, myeloid blood cells 
multiply and grow very quickly in bone marrow and blood, so that there are too many of them and not 
enough red blood cells in the blood.
How Venclyxto works
Venclyxto works by blocking a protein in the body called  BCL-2 . This protein is present in high 
amounts in some cancer cells and helps cancer cells survive. Blocking this protein helps to kill and 
lower the number of cancer cells. It also slows down the worsening of the disease.</p>         </div>"""

<p>you are allergic to the active substance venetoclax or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
-
you have CLL and are taking any of the medicines listed below when you start your treatment and 
while your dose is gradually being increased (usually over 5 weeks). This is because serious and 
life-threatening effects can occur when Venclyxto is taken with these medicines:</p>
<p>itraconazole ketoconazole, posaconazole, or voriconazole for fungal infections</p>
<p>clarithromycin for bacterial infections</p>
<p>ritonavir for HIV infection.
When your Venclyxto dose has been increased to the full standard dose, check with your doctor if 
you can start taking these medicines again.
-
you are taking a herbal medicine called St. John s wort, used for depression. If you are not sure 
about this, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Venclyxto.
It is important that you tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse about all the medicines you take, 
including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Your doctor 
may need to stop certain medicines when you first start taking Venclyxto and during the first days or 
weeks when your dose is increased to the full standard dose. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Venclyxto if:</p>
<p>you have any kidney problems as your risk for a side effect called tumour lysis syndrome may 
increase</p>
<p>you have liver problems as this may increase your risk for side effects. Your doctor may need to 
reduce your dose of Venclyxto</p>
<p>you think you may have an infection or have had a long-lasting or repeated infection</p>
<p>you are due to have a vaccine. 
If any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before 
taking this medicine.
Tumour Lysis Syndrome
Some people may develop unusual levels of some body salts (such as potassium and uric acid) in the 
blood caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This may lead to changes in 
kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. This is called tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). The risk 
for TLS is in the first days or weeks of treatment with Venclyxto, as you increase your dose. 
If you have CLL
Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will do blood tests to check for TLS. 
Your doctor will also give you medicines to help prevent the build-up of uric acid in your body before 
you start treatment with Venclyxto.
Drinking plenty of water, at least 1.5 to 2 litres per day, helps to remove cancer cell breakdown 
products from your body through urine and may decrease your risk of getting TLS (see section 3).
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get any of the symptoms of TLS listed in 
section 4. If you are at risk of TLS you may be treated in hospital so that you can be given fluids into the vein if 
needed, have blood tests done more often and to check for side effects. This is to see if you can 
continue to take this medicine safely. 
If you have AML
You may be treated in hospital and your doctor or nurse will make sure that you have enough 
water/fluids, give you medicines to prevent the build-up of uric acid in your body and do blood tests 
before you start to take Venclyxto, while they increase your dose and when you start to take the full 
dose.
Children and adolescents
Venclyxto should not be used in children and adolescents. This is because it has not been studied in 
these age groups.
Other medicines and Venclyxto
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines as they can increase or 
decrease the amount of venetoclax in your blood:
-
medicines for fungal infections   fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, or 
voriconazole
-
antibiotics to treat bacterial infections   ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nafcillin, or 
rifampicin
-
medicines to prevent seizures or to treat epilepsy   carbamazepine, phenytoin 
-
medicines for HIV infection   efavirenz, etravirine, ritonavir
-
medicines to treat raised blood pressure or angina   diltiazem, verapamil
-
medicines to lower cholesterol levels in the blood   cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam
-
a medicine used to treat a lung condition called pulmonary arterial hypertension   bosentan 
-
a medicine to treat sleep disorder (narcolepsy) known as modafinil
-
a herbal medicine known as St. John s wort
Your doctor may change your dose of Venclyxto.
Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines as Venclyxto may affect how they work:</p>
<p>medicines that prevent blood clots, warfarin, dabigatran</p>
<p>a medicine used to treat heart problems known as digoxin</p>
<p>a medicine for cancer known as everolimus</p>
<p>a medicine used to prevent organ rejection known as sirolimus</p>
<p>medicines to lower cholesterol levels in the blood known as statins
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and 
supplements. This is because Venclyxto may affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some 
other medicines can affect the way Venclyxto works. 
Venclyxto with food and drink
Do not eat grapefruit products, Seville oranges (bitter oranges, often used in marmalades), or starfruit 
(carambola) while you are taking Venclyxto   this includes eating them, drinking the juice or taking a 
supplement that might contain them. This is because they can increase the amount of venetoclax in 
your blood.
Pregnancy
-
Do not get pregnant while you are taking this medicine. If you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before 
taking this medicine.
-
Venclyxto should not be used during pregnancy. There is no information about the safety of 
venetoclax in pregnant women.
Contraception
-
Women of childbearing age must use a highly effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least 30 days after receiving Venclyxto to avoid becoming pregnant. If you are using 
hormonal contraceptive pills or devices, you must also use a barrier method of contraception (such 
as condoms) as the effect of hormonal contraceptive pills or devices may be affected by 
Venclyxto. 
-
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking this medicine.
Breast-feeding
Do not breast-feed while you are taking this medicine. It is not known whether the active substance in 
Venclyxto passes into breast milk. 
Fertility
Based on findings in animals, Venclyxto may cause male infertility (low or no sperm count). This may 
affect your ability to father a child. Ask your doctor for advice on sperm storage before starting 
treatment with Venclyxto.
Driving and using machines
You may feel tired or dizzy after taking Venclyxto, which may affect your ability to drive or use tools 
or machines. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines.
Venclyxto contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium 
free .</p>         </div>"""

How much to take
If you have CLL
You will begin treatment with Venclyxto at a low-dose for 1 week. Your doctor will gradually 
increase the dose over the next 4 weeks to the full standard dose. For the first 4 weeks you will get a 
new pack each week.</p>
<p>the starting dose is 20 mg (two 10 mg tablets) once a day for 7 days.</p>
<p>the dose will be increased to 50 mg (one 50 mg tablet) once a day for 7 days.</p>
<p>the dose will be increased to 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet) once a day for 7 days.</p>

<p>the dose will be increased to 400 mg (four 100 mg tablets) once a day for 7 days.</p>
<p>When you are receiving Venclyxto therapy alone, you will stay on the 400 mg daily dose, 
which is the standard dose, for as long as necessary. </p>
<p>When you are receiving Venclyxto therapy in combination with rituximab, you will 
receive the 400 mg daily dose for 24 months.</p>
<p>When you are receiving Venclyxto therapy in combination with obinutuzumab, you will 
receive the 400 mg daily dose for approximately 10 months.
Your dose may need to be adjusted for side effects. Your doctor will advise what your dose should be.
If you have AML
You will begin treatment with Venclyxto on a lower dose. Your doctor will gradually increase the 
dose each day for the first 3 days. After 3 days you will take the full standard dose. The dose (tablets) 
is taken once a day.
Doses are listed in the table below
Day
Venclyxto daily dose
1
100 mg (One 100 mg tablet)
2
200 mg (Two 100 mg tablets)
3 and after
400 mg (Four 100 mg tablets)
Your doctor will give you Venclyxto in combination with another medicine (azacitidine or decitabine).
You will keep taking Venclyxto at the full dose until either your AML gets worse or you cannot take 
Venclyxto as it is causing serious side effects.
How to take Venclyxto</p>
<p>Take the tablets with a meal at around the same time each day </p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water</p>
<p>Do not chew, crush, or break the tablets</p>
<p>During the first days or weeks of treatment as you increase the dose, you should take the tablets in 
the morning to help you follow-up with blood tests, if needed.
If you vomit after taking Venclyxto, do not take an extra dose that day. Take the next dose at the usual 
time the next day. If you have problems taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.
Drink plenty of water
If you have CLL
It is very important that you drink plenty of water when taking Venclyxto during the first 5 weeks of 
treatment. This will help to remove cancer cell breakdown products from your blood through your 
urine. 
You should start drinking at least 1.5 to 2 litres of water daily two days before starting Venclyxto. You 
may also include non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated drinks in this amount, but exclude grapefruit, 
Seville orange, or starfruit (carambola) juices. You should continue to drink at least 1.5 to 2 litres of 
water on the day you start Venclyxto. Drink the same amount of water (at least 1.5 to 2 litres daily) 
two days before and on the day that your dose is increased. 
If your doctor thinks that you are at risk of TLS, you may be treated in the hospital so that you can be 
given extra fluids into the vein if needed, have your blood tests more often and be checked for side 
effects. This is to see if you can continue to take this medicine safely. 
If you have AML
It is very important you drink plenty of water when taking Venclyxto especially when you start 
treatment and increase your dose. Drinking water will help to remove cancer cell breakdown products 
from your blood through your urine. Your doctor or nurse will give you fluids into the vein if needed
if you are in hospital to make sure this happens.
If you take more Venclyxto than you should
If you take more Venclyxto than you should, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse or go to hospital 
immediately. Take the tablets and this leaflet with you.
If you forget to take Venclyxto</p>
<p>If it is less than 8 hours since the time you usually take your dose, take it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If it is more than 8 hours since the time you usually take your dose, do not take the dose that 
day. Return to your normal dose schedule the next day.</p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p>
<p>If you are not sure talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Do not stop taking Venclyxto
Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. If you have any further questions on 
the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
