  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Ventavis is 
The active substance of Ventavis is iloprost. It imitates a natural substance in the body called 
prostacyclin. Ventavis inhibits unwanted blocking or narrowing of blood vessels and allows more 
blood to flow through the vessels.  </p>
<p>What Ventavis is used for 
Ventavis is used to treat moderate cases of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in adult patients. 
PPH is a category of pulmonary hypertension where the cause of the high blood pressure is not known.<br />
This is a condition where blood pressure is too high in the blood vessels between the heart and the 
lungs.<br />
Ventavis is used to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry out physical activity) and symptoms. </p>
<p>How Ventavis works 
Breathing in the mist carries Ventavis to the lungs, where it can work most effectively in the artery 
between heart and lungs. Improved blood flow leads to a better supply of oxygen to the body and 
reduced strain on the heart. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are at risk of bleeding  for example, if you have an active ulcer of the stomach or of the 
first part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcers), if you have suffered a physical injury (trauma), 
if you are at risk of bleeding within the skull, 
* if you have a heart problem, such as 
- poor blood flow to the heart muscles (severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina). 
Symptoms can include chest pain, 
- a heart attack within the last six months, 
- a weak heart (decompensated cardiac failure) which is not under close medical 
observation, 
- severe unstable heartbeat, 
- a defect of the heart valves (inborn or acquired) that causes the heart to work </p>
<p>poorly (not related to pulmonary hypertension), 
* if you have had a stroke within the last 3 months, or any other occurrence that reduced the 
blood supply to the brain (e.g. transient ischaemic attack), 
* if your pulmonary hypertension is due to a blocked or narrowed vein (venous occlusive 
disease). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ventavis:<br />
* Inhaling Ventavis might trigger breathing difficulties (see section 4), especially in patients with 
bronchospasm (sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the small airways) and 
wheezing. Tell your doctor if you have a lung infection, severe asthma, or chronic lung 
disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Your doctor will monitor you closely. 
* Your blood pressure will be checked before treatment and if it is too low (less than 
85 mmHg for the upper value) then therapy with Ventavis should not be started. 
* In general, you will need to take special care to try and avoid effects of low blood pressure, 
such as fainting and dizziness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medication because the combined effect with 
Ventavis may lower your blood pressure further (see below "Other medicines and 
Ventavis"). </li>
<li>Stand up slowly when you get out of chairs or bed.  </li>
<li>If you tend to faint as soon as you get out of bed, it may be helpful to take your first dose 
of the day while you are still lying down. </li>
<li>If you tend to experience fainting episodes, avoid any exceptional straining, for example 
during physical exertion; it might be useful to inhale Ventavis before.  </li>
<li>Fainting episodes may be due to the underlying disease. Tell your doctor if they get worse. 
He/she may consider adjusting your dose or changing your treatment. </li>
<li>If you suffer from a weak heart condition such as right heart failure, and feel that your 
disease is worsening, tell your doctor. Symptoms can include swelling of feet and ankles, 
shortness of breath, palpitations, urinating more frequently at night or oedema. Your doctor will 
consider changing your treatment. </li>
<li>If you experience difficulty breathing, cough up blood, and/or sweat excessively these may 
be signs that you have water in the lungs (lung oedema). Stop using Ventavis and tell your 
doctor immediately. He/she will look for the cause and take appropriate measures. </li>
<li>If you have liver problems or very severe kidney problems, requiring dialysis, tell your 
doctor. You may be gradually introduced to the prescribed dose or be prescribed a lower dose of 
Ventavis than for other patients (see section 3. "How to use Ventavis"). </li>
</ul>
<p>Contact of Ventavis with skin or swallowing Ventavis 
* Do NOT let Ventavis solution come into contact with your skin or eyes.<br />
If it does, rinse the skin or your eyes immediately with plenty of water.<br />
* Do NOT drink or swallow Ventavis solution.<br />
If you swallow it accidentally, drink plenty of water and tell your doctor.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of Ventavis in children aged up to 18 years have not been established.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ventavis 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. Ventavis and certain other medicines may affect each other in the way they work in your 
body. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking: </p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart disease, such as  </li>
<li>beta blockers, </li>
<li>nitro-vasodilators, </li>
<li>
<p>ACE inhibitors. 
Your blood pressure may drop much further. 
Your doctor may change the dosage. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicines that thin the blood or inhibit blood clotting, this includes </p>
</li>
<li>acetylsalicylic acid (ASA - a compound found in many medicines that lower fever and 
relieve pain), </li>
<li>heparin, </li>
<li>coumarin-type anticoagulants, such as warfarin or phenprocoumon, </li>
<li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, </li>
<li>non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as pentoxifylline, </li>
<li>selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE 3) inhibitors, such as cilostazol or anagrelide, </li>
<li>ticlopidine, </li>
<li>clopidogrel, </li>
<li>glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, such as * 
abciximab,  * 
eptifibatide, * 
tirofiban, </li>
<li>defibrotide. 
Your doctor will monitor you carefully. </li>
</ul>
<p>Before taking any medicine ask your doctor or pharmacist, who has more information on medicines to 
be careful with or avoid when using Ventavis. </p>
<p>Ventavis with food and drink 
Food or drink is not expected to affect Ventavis. However, you should avoid taking food or drink 
during inhalation. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
  If you suffer from pulmonary hypertension, avoid getting pregnant as pregnancy may lead to a 
worsening of your condition and may even endanger your life. 
  If you could get pregnant, use reliable contraception from the time you start treatment and during 
treatment. 
  If you are pregnant, think you might be or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor 
straight away. Ventavis should only be used during pregnancy if your doctor decides that the 
potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to you and the foetus. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether Ventavis passes into human milk. A potential risk to the breast-feeding child 
cannot be excluded and it is preferable to avoid breast-feeding during Ventavis therapy. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Newborns, infants and pregnant women should not be in the same room while you are inhaling 
Ventavis. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Ventavis lowers blood pressure and may cause dizziness or light-headedness in some people.<br />
Do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel these effects.  </p>
<p>Ventavis contains ethanol 
Ventavis 10 microgram/ml contains 0.81 mg alcohol (ethanol) in each ml which is equivalent to 
0.081% (w/v). The amount of 0.81 mg of alcohol in 1 ml of this medicine is equivalent to less than 
1 ml beer or wine.<br />
The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much to inhale and for how long </p>
<p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>
<p>The dose of Ventavis and the duration of treatment that is right for you depend on your individual 
condition. Your doctor will advise you. Do not change the recommended dose without consulting your 
doctor first. </p>
<p>Different nebuliser devices can be used to administer Ventavis. Depending on the type of device used 
and dose prescribed, 1 ml or 2 ml of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml are appropriate. </p>
<ul>
<li>Breelib nebuliser </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are starting Ventavis treatment or if you switch from an alternative device your first inhalation 
will be with Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml ampoule with white and yellow rings). If you tolerate 
this dose well, your next inhalation will be with Ventavis 20 microgram/ml (ampoule with yellow and 
red rings). You should continue on this dose. </p>
<p>If you cannot tolerate inhalation of Ventavis 20 microgram/ml talk to your doctor who may decide that 
you should take Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml ampoule). </p>
<p>Most people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day. One inhalation session 
with Breelib will usually last about 3 minutes. </p>
<p>Your doctor will supervise your treatment when you start using the Breelib nebuliser to ensure that 
you tolerate dose and speed of inhalation well. </p>
<ul>
<li>I-Neb AAD nebuliser (1 ml ampoule with white and yellow rings) </li>
</ul>
<p>In general, when starting Ventavis treatment the first inhaled dose should be 2.5 microgram iloprost as 
delivered at the mouthpiece. If you tolerate this dose well, your dose should be increased to 
5 microgram iloprost and you should continue on this dose. If you are unable to tolerate the 
5 microgram dose, the dose should be reduced to 2.5 microgram. </p>
<p>Most people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day. One inhalation session 
will usually last about 4 to 10 minutes with I-Neb AAD depending on the prescribed dose.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Venta-Neb nebuliser (2 ml ampoule with white and pink rings) </li>
</ul>
<p>In general, when starting Ventavis treatment the first inhaled dose should be 2.5 microgram iloprost as 
delivered at the mouthpiece. If you tolerate this dose well, your dose should be increased to 
5 microgram and you should continue on this dose. If you are unable to tolerate the 5 microgram dose, 
the dose should be reduced to 2.5 microgram. </p>
<p>Most people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day. One inhalation session 
with Venta-Neb will usually last about 4 to 10 minutes depending on the prescribed dose.  </p>
<p>Depending on your individual needs, Ventavis can be used for long term treatment. </p>
<p>If you have kidney or liver problems </p>
<p>There is no need to alter the dose in patients with mild or moderate kidney problems (patients with a 
creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min).  </p>
<p>If you have very severe kidney problems and require dialysis or if you have liver problems, your 
doctor will introduce you to Ventavis gradually and possibly prescribe fewer daily inhalations. Start 
therapy by inhaling 2.5 microgram iloprost using 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (with 
white and yellow rings). Use dosing intervals of 3   4 hours (this corresponds to a maximum of 
6 administrations per day). Thereafter, your doctor may cautiously shorten the dosing intervals 
depending on how you tolerate the treatment. If your doctor decides to further increase the dose up to 
5 microgram, again dosing intervals of 3 - 4 hours should be chosen initially and shortened depending 
on how you tolerate the treatment. </p>
<p>If you feel that the effect of Ventavis is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
Ask your doctor to have someone help you become thoroughly familiar with the use of the nebuliser. 
You should not switch to another nebuliser without consulting the doctor who is treating you. </p>
<p>How to inhale </p>
<p>For each inhalation session you should use a new ampoule of Ventavis. Just before you start to 
inhale, break the glass ampoule and pour the solution into the medication chamber following the 
instructions for use of the nebuliser. </p>
<p>Follow carefully the instructions that come with the nebuliser especially the instructions on 
hygiene and cleaning of the nebuliser. </p>
<p>Always take Ventavis exactly as your doctor has told you.<br />
<em> Ventavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution is inhaled using the nebulisers your doctor 
prescribed (either the Breelib, the Venta-Neb or the I-Neb AAD system).<br />
</em> The nebuliser turns Ventavis solution into a mist which you breathe in through your 
mouth.<br />
* For the inhalation you should use a mouthpiece to prevent Ventavis coming into contact 
with your skin. Do not use a facial mask. 
* Follow carefully any instructions that come with the nebuliser. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are unsure. 
* Any Ventavis solution remaining in the nebuliser after inhalation must be thrown away (see 
section 5). </p>
<p>Room ventilation 
Be sure to ventilate or air the room in which you have taken your Ventavis treatment. Other people 
might accidentally be exposed to Ventavis through the room air. In particular, newborns, infants and 
pregnant women should not be in the same room while you are inhaling Ventavis. </p>

<p>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: </p>
<p>Instructions for use and handling </p>
<p>Patients stabilised on one nebuliser should not switch to another nebuliser without close supervision 
by the treating doctor as different nebulisers have been shown to produce aerosols with slightly 
different physical characteristics and may have faster delivery of the solution (see section 5.2 of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics). </p>
<p>To minimise accidental exposure, it is recommended to keep the room well ventilated. </p>
<ul>
<li>Breelib </li>
</ul>
<p>When using the Breelib nebuliser please follow the instructions for use provided with the device. 
Fill the medication chamber with Ventavis immediately before use. </p>

<li>I-Neb AAD  </li>
</ul>
<p>The I-Neb AAD System is a portable, hand-held, vibrating mesh technology nebuliser system. This 
system generates droplets by ultrasound, which forces the solution through a mesh. The I-Neb AAD 
nebuliser has been shown to be suitable for the administration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml 
ampoule with white and yellow rings).<br />
The measured MMAD of the aerosol droplets was 2.1 micrometres.<br />
This nebuliser monitors the breathing pattern to determine the aerosol pulse time required to deliver 
the pre-set dose of 2.5 or 5 microgram iloprost.  </p>
<p>The dose delivered by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber in combination 
with a control disc. Each medication chamber is colour coded and has a corresponding colour coded 
control disc. </p>
<ul>
<li>For the 2.5 microgram dose the medication chamber with the red latch is used together with 
the red control disc.  </li>
<li>For the 5 microgram dose the medication chamber with the purple coloured latch is used 
together with the purple control disc. </li>
</ul>
<p>For each inhalation session with the I-Neb AAD, the content of one 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis, with 
two coloured rings (white - yellow) is transferred into the medication chamber immediately before 
use.  </p>

<p>Venta-Neb, a portable ultrasonic battery-powered nebuliser, has also been shown to be suitable for the 
administration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml. The measured MMAD of the aerosol droplets was 
2.6 micrometres. For each inhalation session, the content of one ampoule containing 2 ml of Ventavis 
10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution and marked with two coloured rings (white   pink) is transferred 
into the nebuliser medication chamber immediately before use.  </p>
<p>Two programmes can be operated: 
* P1 Programme 1: 5 microgram active substance on the mouth piece 25 inhalation cycles. 
* P2 Programme 2: 2.5 microgram active substance on the mouth piece 10 inhalation cycles. 
The selection of the pre-set programme is made by the doctor. </p>
<p>Venta-Neb prompts the patient to inhale by an optical and an acoustic signal. It stops after the pre-set 
dose has been administered. To obtain the optimal droplet size for the administration of Ventavis the 
green baffle plate should be used. For details refer to the instruction manual of the Venta-Neb 
nebuliser. </p>
