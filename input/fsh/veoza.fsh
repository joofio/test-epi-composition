menopausal women to reduce moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with 
menopause. VMS are also known as hot flashes or night sweats. </p>
<p>Before menopause, there is a balance between oestrogens, a female sex hormone, and a protein made 
by the brain known as neurokinin B (NKB) that regulates your brain s temperature control centre. As 
your body goes through menopause, oestrogen levels decline and this balance is disrupted, which can 
lead to VMS. By blocking NKB binding in your temperature control centre, Veoza reduces the number 
and intensity of hot flashes and night sweats. </p>         </div>"""
