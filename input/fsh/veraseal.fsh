</ul>
<p>VeraSeal must not be applied inside blood vessels. </p>
<p>VeraSeal must not be used to treat severe or rapid bleeding from an artery. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Allergic reactions are possible. Signs of such reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, drop in blood pressure (e.g. light-headedness, fainting, blurred vision), and anaphylaxis (a 
severe reaction with a rapid onset). If these symptoms occur during surgery, the use of the medicine 
should be stopped immediately. </p>
<p>VeraSeal spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance. 
The spray device should not be used closer than the recommended distance.<br />
Special safety warning </p>
<p>For medicines such as VeraSeal that are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are 
taken to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include carefully selecting blood and 
plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and testing each donation 
and pooled plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers also include steps in the processing of 
the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines 
prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot 
be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.  </p>
<p>The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The 
measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and for individuals 
whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or 
haemolytic anaemia). </p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that every time you are treated with VeraSeal, the name and batch number 
of the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>VeraSeal is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and VeraSeal </p>
<p>The product may be affected after contacting solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g. 
antiseptic solutions). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being treated with this medicine. Your doctor will decide whether you 
should be treated with VeraSeal. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The surgeon will apply VeraSeal to the surface of blood vessels or to the tissue surface of internal 
organs using an application device during the course of the operation. This device allows equal 
amounts of the two components of VeraSeal to be administered at the same time, and ensures that they 
mix evenly, which is important for the sealant to work at its best. </p>
<p>The amount of VeraSeal that will be applied depends on a number of factors, including the type of 
surgery, the size of the area to be treated during your operation and the way VeraSeal is applied. The 
surgeon will decide how much is appropriate, and will apply just enough to form a thin, even layer. If 
it does not seem to be enough, a second layer can be applied. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  </p>
<p>VeraSeal contains the component of fibrin sealant. Fibrin sealants may, in rare cases (up to 1 in 
1,000 people), cause an allergic reaction. If you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or 
more of the following symptoms: swelling under skin (angioedema), skin rash, hives or wheals 
(nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, heart rate increase, tingling, vomiting or wheezing. In isolated cases, these reactions may 
progress to a severe allergic reaction. Allergic reactions may especially be seen if the preparation is 
applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be allergic to constituents of the product. If 
you experience any of these symptoms after surgery, you should immediately consult your doctor or 
surgeon. </p>
<p>There is also a theoretical possibility that your immune system will produce proteins to attack 
VeraSeal and, that these may interfere with your blood clotting. The frequency of this type of event is 
not known. </p>
<p>If this product is accidentally placed inside a blood vessel, it can lead to blood clots, including 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (when blood clots form throughout the blood vessels in 
the body). There is also a risk of a severe allergic reaction. </p>
