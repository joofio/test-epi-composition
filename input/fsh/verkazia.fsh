<p>Verkazia is used to treat children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years with severe vernal

the transparent layer in the front part of the eye and the thin membrane covering the front part of the

- if you are allergic to ciclosporin or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have had or have a cancer in or around your eye. 
- if you have an eye infection. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Only use Verkazia in your eye as described under section 3. Do not exceed the treatment period 
prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Verkazia:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have had an eye infection or if you suspect you have an eye infection. </li>
<li>if you have any other kind of eye disease. </li>
<li>if you wear contact lenses (the use of Verkazia is not recommended with contact lenses). </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not use Verkazia in children under the age of 4 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Verkazia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids administered in association with 
Verkazia as this association may increase the risk of local infections. </p>
<p>If you are using Verkazia for more than 12 months, you should visit your doctor regularly, e.g. every 
3 to 6 months. </p>
<p>If you are using other eye drops, use Verkazia at least 15 minutes after using the other eye drops. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Verkazia should not be used if you are pregnant. If you could become pregnant you must use 
contraception while using this medicine. </p>
<p>Verkazia is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to 
your doctor before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your vision may be temporarily blurred after using Verkazia eye drops or you may get other 
disturbances with your vision. If this happens, wait until your vision clears before you drive or use 
machines. </p>
<p>Verkazia contains cetalkonium chloride<br />
Cetalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>A caregiver should help a child starting Verkazia treatment, particularly if the child is aged under 
10 years, and should continue to supervise the child until the child is able to use Verkazia properly 
without help. </p>
<p>The recommended dose is 1 drop of Verkazia in each affected eye 4 times a day (morning, mid-day, 
afternoon and evening). You should continue Verkazia as prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>Instructions for use 
Follow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not 
understand. </p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands. </li>
<li>Open the aluminium pouch, which contains 5 single-dose containers. </li>
<li>Take one single-dose container from the aluminium pouch, leaving the remaining 
containers in the pouch. </li>
<li>Gently shake the single-dose container. </li>
<li>Twist off the cap (picture 1). </li>
<li>Pull down your lower eyelid (picture 2). </li>
<li>Tilt your head back and look up at the ceiling. </li>
<li>Gently squeeze one drop of the medicine onto your eye. Make sure that the tip of the 
single-dose container does not touch your eye. </li>
<li>Blink a few times so that the medicine spreads across your eye. </li>
<li>After using Verkazia, press a finger lightly on the inner corner of your eyelid, next to your 
nose for 2 minutes (picture 3). A small duct that drains tears away from your eye and into 
your nose is located here. By pressing at this point, you close down the opening of this 
drainage duct. This helps to stop Verkazia getting into the rest of the body. </li>
<li>If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps 6 to 9 for your other eye. </li>
<li>Discard the single-dose container as soon as you have used it, even if there is still some 
medicine left in it. </li>
</ol>
<p>If a drop misses your eye, try again. </p>
<p>If you put in more Verkazia than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more 
drops until it is time for your next regular dose. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Verkazia, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not take a double dose 
to make up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than 1 drop 4 times a day in the affected eye(s). </p>
<p>If you stop using Verkazia without speaking to your doctor, your eye allergy will not be controlled 
and could lead to long-term problems with your sight. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
