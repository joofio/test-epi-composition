<p>Verkazia is used to treat children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years with severe vernal 
keratoconjunctivitis (an allergic condition of the eye that occurs more frequently in spring and affects 
the transparent layer in the front part of the eye and the thin membrane covering the front part of the

<p>Other medicines and Verkazia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids administered in association with 
Verkazia as this association may increase the risk of local infections. </p>
<p>If you are using Verkazia for more than 12 months, you should visit your doctor regularly, e.g. every 
3 to 6 months. </p>
<p>If you are using other eye drops, use Verkazia at least 15 minutes after using the other eye drops. </p>

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. </p>

contraception while using this medicine. </p>
<p>Verkazia is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to 
your doctor before using this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Your vision may be temporarily blurred after using Verkazia eye drops or you may get other 
disturbances with your vision. If this happens, wait until your vision clears before you drive or use 
machines. </p>
<p>Verkazia contains cetalkonium chloride<br />
Cetalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation. </p>         </div>"""
