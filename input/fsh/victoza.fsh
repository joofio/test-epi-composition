<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse: 
* before using Victoza. 
* if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. </p>
<p>This medicine should not be used if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin) 
or diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar and increase in effort to 
breathe). It is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. </p>
<p>The use of Victoza is not recommended if you are on dialysis. 
The use of Victoza is not recommended if you have severe liver disease. 
The use of Victoza is not recommended if you have severe heart failure. </p>
<p>This medicine is not recommended if you have a severe stomach or gut problem which results in 
delayed stomach emptying (called gastroparesis), or inflammatory bowel disease. </p>
<p>If you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, such as persistent, severe stomach ache, you should 
consult your doctor immediately (see section 4). </p>
<p>If you have thyroid disease including thyroid nodules and enlargement of the thyroid gland, consult 
your doctor. </p>
<p>When initiating treatment with Victoza, you may in some cases experience loss of fluids/dehydration, 
e.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty 
of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Victoza can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. No data are available in 
children below 10 years of age. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Victoza 
Please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing any of the 
following active substances: 
* Sulfonylurea (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide) or insulin. You may get hypoglycaemia 
(low blood sugar) when using Victoza together with a sulfonylurea or insulin, as sulfonylureas 
and insulin increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. When you first start using these medicines 
together, your doctor may tell you to lower the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin. Please see 
section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar. If you are also taking a sulfonylurea (such as 
glimepiride or glibenclamide) or insulin, your doctor may tell you to test your blood sugar 
levels. This will help your doctor to decide if the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be 
changed. 
* If you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will 
recommend you to monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid hyperglycaemia 
(high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the 
body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin). 
* Warfarin or other oral anti-coagulation medicines. More frequent blood testing to determine the 
ability of your blood to clot may be required. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are, you think you might be, or are planning to become pregnant. Victoza 
should not be used during pregnancy because it is not known if it may harm your unborn child. </p>
<p>It is not known if Victoza passes into breast milk, therefore do not use this medicine if you are breast-
feeding. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using 
machines if you experience signs of hypoglycaemia. Please see section 4 for the warning signs of low 
blood sugar. Please consult your doctor for further information on this topic. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Victoza 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that it is essentially 
 sodium free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE VICTOZA PEN 
Please read these instructions carefully before using 
your pen. 
Your pen comes with 18 mg of liraglutide. You can select 
doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg. 
The pen is designed to be used with NovoFine or 
NovoTwist disposable injection needles up to a length of 
8 mm and as thin as 32G (0.25/0.23 mm). </p>
<p>Prepare your pen </p>
<p>Check the name and coloured label of your pen to make 
sure that it contains liraglutide. Using the wrong medicine 
could cause severe harm. </p>
<p>Pull off the pen cap. </p>
<p>Pull off the paper tab from a new disposable needle. 
Screw the needle straight and tightly onto your pen. </p>
<p>Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. </p>
<p>Pull off the inner needle cap and dispose of it. </p>
<p>Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, 
leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. </p>
<p>Be careful not to bend or damage the needle. </p>
<p>Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the 
needle. </p>
<p>Caring for your pen 
* Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. 
* Keep your pen away from dust, dirt and all kinds of liquids. 
* Clean the pen with a cloth moistened with a mild detergent. 
* Do not try to wash, soak or lubricate it   this can harm the pen. </p>
<p>Important information 
* Do not share your pen or needles with anyone else. 
* Keep your pen out of the reach of others, especially children. 
With each new pen, check the flow </p>
<p>Check the flow before your first injection with each 
new pen. If your pen is already in use, go to  Select 
your dose , step H. </p>
<p>Turn the dose selector until the flow check symbol lines 
up with the pointer. </p>
<p>Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Tap the 
cartridge gently with your finger a few times. This will 
make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge. </p>
<p>Keep the needle pointing up and press the dose button 
until 0 mg lines up with the pointer. </p>
<p>A drop of liraglutide should appear at the needle tip. If no 
drop appears, repeat steps E to G up to four times. </p>
<p>If there is still no drop of liraglutide, change the needle 
and repeat steps E to G once more. </p>
<p>Do not use the pen if a drop of liraglutide still does not 
appear. This indicates the pen is defective and you must 
use a new one. </p>
<p>If you have dropped your pen against a hard surface or suspect that something is wrong with it, 
always put on a new disposable needle and check the flow before you inject. </p>
<p>Select your dose </p>
<p>Always check that the pointer lines up with 0 mg. </p>
<p>Turn the dose selector until your needed dose lines up 
with the pointer (0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg). </p>
<p>If you selected a wrong dose by mistake, simply change it 
by turning the dose selector backwards or forwards until 
the right dose lines up with the pointer. </p>
<p>Be careful not to press the dose button when turning the 
dose selector backwards, as liraglutide may come out. </p>
<p>If the dose selector stops before your needed dose lines up 
with the pointer, there is not enough liraglutide left for a 
full dose. Then you can either: </p>
<p>Split your dose into two injections: 
Turn the dose selector in either direction until 0.6 mg or 
1.2 mg lines up with the pointer. Inject the dose. Then 
prepare a new pen for injection and inject the remaining 
number of mg to complete your dose. </p>
<p>You may only split your dose between your current pen 
and a new pen if trained or advised by your healthcare 
professional. Use a calculator to plan the doses. If you 
split the dose wrong, you may inject too much or too little 
liraglutide. </p>
<p>Inject the full dose with a new pen: 
If the dose selector stops before 0.6 mg lines up with the 
pointer, prepare a new pen and inject the full dose with 
the new pen. </p>
<p>Do not try to select other doses than 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg. The numbers in the display 
must line up precisely with the pointer to ensure that you get the correct dose. 
The dose selector clicks when you turn it. Do not use these clicks to select your dose. 
Do not use the cartridge scale to measure how much liraglutide to inject   it is not accurate 
enough. 
Inject your dose </p>
<p>Insert the needle into your skin using the injection 
technique shown by your doctor or nurse. Then follow 
the instructions below: </p>
<p>Press the dose button to inject until 0 mg lines up with the 
pointer. Be careful not to touch the display with your 
other fingers or press the dose selector sideways when 
you inject. This is because it may block the injection. 
Keep the dose button pressed down and leave the needle 
under the skin for at least 6 seconds. This is to make sure 
that you get your full dose.  </p>
<p>Pull out the needle. 
After that, you may see a drop liraglutide at the needle 
tip. 
This is normal and does not affect your dose. </p>
<p>Guide the needle tip into the outer needle cap without 
touching the needle or the outer needle cap. </p>
<p>When the needle is covered, carefully push the outer 
needle cap completely on. Then unscrew the needle. 
Dispose of it carefully and put the pen cap back on. </p>
<p>When the pen is empty, carefully dispose of it without a 
needle attached. Please dispose of the pen and needle in 
accordance with local requirements. </p>
<p>Always remove the needle after each injection, and store your pen without a needle attached. </p>
<p>This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of liraglutide, blocked needles and 
inaccurate dosing. </p>
<p>Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles   to prevent needle injury and 
cross-infection. </p>         </div>"""
