Vidaza is an anti-cancer agent which belongs to a group of medicines called  anti-metabolites . Vidaza 
contains the active substance  azacitidine . </p>
<p>What Vidaza is used for 
Vidaza is used in adults who are not able to have a stem cell transplantation to treat: 
* higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). 
* chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). 
* acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). </p>
<p>These are diseases which affect the bone marrow and can cause problems with normal blood cell 
production. </p>
<p>How Vidaza works 
Vidaza works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine becomes incorporated into the 
genetic material of cells (ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). It is thought to 
work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the production of 
new RNA and DNA. These actions are thought to correct problems with the maturation and growth of 
young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill cancerous cells 
in leukaemia. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Vidaza works or why this medicine 
has been prescribed for you. </p>         </div>"""
