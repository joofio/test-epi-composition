used to treat adults with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused 
by the hepatitis C virus). 
The combined action of the three active substances stops the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and 
infecting new cells, thus clearing the virus from your blood over a period of time. Ombitasvir and
paritaprevir block two proteins essential for the virus to multiply. Ritonavir acts as a  booster  to prolong 
the action of paritaprevir in the body.
Viekirax tablets are taken with other antiviral medicines such as dasabuvir and ribavirin. Your doctor will 
talk with you about which of these medicines to take with Viekirax.
It is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other antiviral medicines that you take 
with Viekirax. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

doctor can:</p>
<p>Decide what other medicines you should take with Viekirax and for how long.</p>
<p>Confirm if your treatment has worked and if you are free of the hepatitis C virus.</p>
<p>Check for side effects of Viekirax or other antiviral medicines your doctor has prescribed for you to

Pregnancy and contraception 
The effects of Viekirax during pregnancy are not known. Viekirax should not be used during pregnancy or 
in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.</p>
<p>You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment. Contraceptive 
medicines that contain ethinyloestradiol cannot be used in combination with Viekirax. Ask your 
doctor about the best contraception for you.
Extra precautions are needed if Viekirax is taken together with ribavirin. Ribavirin may cause severe birth 
defects. Ribavirin stays for a long time in the body after treatment is stopped, and effective contraception 
is therefore needed both during treatment and for some time afterwards.
  There is a risk for birth defects when ribavirin is given to a female patient that becomes pregnant. 
  There may also be a risk for birth defects if ribavirin is taken by a male patient, whose female 
partner becomes pregnant. 
  Read the  Contraception  section of the package leaflet for ribavirin very carefully. It is important 
that both men and women read the information.
  If you or your partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Viekirax and ribavirin or in the 
months that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately.
Breastfeeding
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Viekirax. It is not known whether the active substances 
in Viekirax (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir) pass into breast milk.
Driving and using machines 
Some patients have reported feeling very tired when taking Viekirax with other medicines for their hepatitis 
C infection. If you feel tired, do not drive or use machines.</p>         </div>"""
