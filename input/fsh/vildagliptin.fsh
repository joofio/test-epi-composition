hydrochloride, belong to a group of medicines called “oral antidiabetics”. </p>
<p>Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. This 
type of diabetes is also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Vildagliptin/Metformin 
hydrochloride Accord is used when diabetes cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone and/or 
with other medicines used to treat diabetes (insulin or sulphonylureas). </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body 
makes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. </p>
<p>Both insulin and glucagon are made in the pancreas. Insulin helps to lower the level of sugar in the 
blood, especially after meals. Glucagon triggers the liver to make sugar, causing the blood sugar level 
to rise. </p>
<p>How Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord works 
Both active substances, vildagliptin and metformin, help to control the level of sugar in the blood. The 
substance vildagliptin works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. The 
substance metformin works by helping the body to make better use of insulin. This medicine has been 
shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent complications from your diabetes. </p>         </div>"""

taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord. 
- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood 
glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see “Risk of lactic 
acidosis” below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called ketone 
bodies accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include 
stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity 
smell. 
- if you have recently had a heart attack or if you have heart failure or serious problems with your 
blood circulation or difficulties in breathing which could be a sign of heart problems. 
- if you have severely reduced kidney function. 
- if you have a severe infection or are seriously dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your 
body). 
- if you are going to have a contrast x-ray (a specific type of x-ray involving an injectable dye). 
Please also see information about this in section “Warnings and precautions”. 
- if you have liver problems. 
- if you drink alcohol excessively (whether every day or only from time to time). 
- if you are breast-feeding (see also “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Risk of lactic acidosis 
Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect 
called lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing 
lactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or 
alcohol intake, dehydration (see further information below), liver problems and any medical 
conditions in which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart 
disease). 
If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord for a short time if you have a 
condition that may be associated with dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe 
vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor 
for further instructions. </p>
<p>Stop taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord and contact a doctor or the nearest 
hospital immediately if you experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition 
may lead to coma. 
Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: 
- vomiting 
- stomach ache (abdominal pain) 
- muscle cramps 
- a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness 
- difficulty in breathing 
- reduced body temperature and heartbeat </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. </p>
<p>Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord is not a substitute for insulin. Therefore, you should not 
receive Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord<br />
if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord 
if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea. Your doctor may want to reduce 
your dose of the sulphonylurea when you take it together with Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride 
Accord  in order to avoid low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). </p>
<p>If you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should 
not take this medicine. </p>
<p>Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also 
advised to pay particular attention to new onset of blisters or ulcers while taking 
Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord. Should these occur, you should promptly consult 
your doctor. </p>
<p>If you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord <br />
during and for some time after the procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when 
to restart your treatment with Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord.. </p>
<p>A test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of Vildagliptin/Metformin 
hydrochloride Accord  treatment, at three-month intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. 
This is so that signs of increased liver enzymes can be detected as early as possible. </p>
<p>During treatment with Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord your doctor will check your 
kidney function at least once a year or more frequently if you are elderly and/or have worsening renal 
function. </p>
<p>Your doctor will test your blood and urine for sugar regularly. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The use of Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord in children and adolescents up to 18 years of 
age is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord 
If you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for 
example in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Vildagliptin/Metformin 
hydrochloride Accord before or at the time of the injection. Your doctor will decide when you must 
stop and when to restart your treatment with Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord.. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You may 
need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the 
dosage of Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord.It is especially important to mention the 
following: 
- glucocorticoids generally used to treat inflammation 
- beta-2 agonists generally used to treat respiratory disorders 
- other medicines used to treat diabetes 
- medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) 
- medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as 
ibuprofen and celecoxib) 
- certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists) 
- certain medicines affecting the thyroid 
- certain medicines affecting the nervous system 
- certain medicines used to treat angina (e.g. ranolazine) 
- certain medicines used to treat HIV infection (e.g. dolutegravir) 
- certain medicines used to treat a specific type of thyroid cancer (medullary thyroid cancer) (e.g. 
vandetanib) 
- certain medicines used to treat heartburn and peptic ulcers (e.g cimetidine) </p>
<p>Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord with alcohol 
Avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord since this 
may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (please see section “Warnings and precautions”). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of 
taking Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord during pregnancy. 
- Do not use Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord if you are pregnant or breast-feeding 
(see also “Do not take Vildagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride Accord ”). </p>

tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""
