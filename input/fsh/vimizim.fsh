  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Vimizim contains an enzyme called elosulfase alfa, which belongs to a group of medicines known as 
enzyme replacement therapies. It is used to treat adults and children with mucopolysaccharidosis 
type IVA (MPS IVA disease, also known as Morquio A Syndrome).  </p>
<p>People with MPS IVA disease either lack completely or do not have enough N-acetylgalactosamine-6-
sulfatase, an enzyme which breaks down specific substances in the body such as keratan sulphate, 
which are found in many tissues of the body, including cartilage and bone. As a result, these 
substances do not get broken down and processed by the body as they should. They accumulate in the 
tissues interfering with their normal function and causing the symptoms of MPS IVA, such as 
difficulty walking, trouble breathing, short height, and hearing loss. </p>
<p>How Vimizim works 
This medicine replaces the natural enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase which is lacking in 
MPS IVA patients. Treatment has been shown to improve walking and to reduce the levels of keratan 
sulphate in the body. This medicine may improve the symptoms of MPS IVA. </p>         </div>"""

- if you have experienced life-threatening allergic reactions to elosulfase alfa or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
- If you are treated with Vimizim, you may develop infusion reactions. An infusion reaction is any 
side effect, including an allergic reaction, occurring during the infusion or within a day following 
infusion (see section 4). If you experience such a reaction, you should immediately contact your 
doctor.<br />
- If you have an allergic reaction during your infusion your doctor may slow down, or stop your 
infusion. Your doctor may also give you additional medicines to manage any allergic reactions 
(e.g. antihistamines and/or corticosteroids). 
- If you experience back pain, numbness in your arms or legs, or lack of control over passing urine 
or stools, you should immediately contact your doctor. These problems can be a part of the 
disease and may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vimizim 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You should not receive Vimizim during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. It is not known whether 
Vimizim is excreted in breast milk. Discuss with your doctor if the benefits of taking Vimizim are 
greater than the potential risk to your newborn while breast-feeding. It is not known if Vimizim 
impacts human fertility. No effect on fertility was observed in animals.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Dizziness was reported in some patients during the Vimizim infusion. Tell your doctor if you feel 
dizzy after your infusion, especially before driving or using any machine where dizziness might be 
dangerous. </p>
<p>Vimizim contains sodium and sorbitol (E 420) 
This medicine contains 8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5 ml vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.4 % of the recommended daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>
<p>This medicine contains 100 mg sorbitol in each 5 ml vial which is equivalent to 40 mg/kg.<br />
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare 
genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine unless discussed with your doctor. 
Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.<br />
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your 
child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects 
such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. </p>         </div>"""
