inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) which are  oral anti-diabetics . It is used to lower blood 
sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent 
diabetes mellitus or NIDDM. </p>
<p>Vipidia works to increase the levels of insulin in the body after a meal and decrease the amount of 
sugar in the body. It must be taken together with other anti-diabetic medicines, which your doctor will 
have prescribed for you, such as sulphonylureas (e.g. glipizide, tolbutamide, glibenclamide), 
metformin and/or thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone) and metformin and/or insulin.  </p>
<p>Vipidia is taken when your blood sugar cannot be adequately controlled by diet, exercise and one or 
more of these other oral anti-diabetic medicines. It is important that you continue to take your other 
anti-diabetic medicine, and continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise that your nurse or doctor 
has given you. </p>         </div>"""

- if you are allergic to alogliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
- if you have had a serious allergic reaction to any other similar medicines that you take to control 
your blood sugar. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include; rash, raised red patches 
on your skin (hives), swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in 
breathing or swallowing. Additional symptoms may include general itching and feeling of heat 
especially affecting the scalp, mouth, throat, palms of hands and soles of feet (Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vipidia:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce insulin) </li>
<li>if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is 
unable to breakdown glucose because there is not enough insulin). Symptoms include excessive 
thirst, frequent urination, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting and rapid weight loss </li>
<li>if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as sulphonylurea (e.g. glipizide, tolbutamide, 
glibenclamide) or insulin. Your doctor may want to reduce your dose of sulphonylurea or 
insulin when you take any of them together with Vipidia in order to avoid too low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) </li>
<li>if you have kidney disease, you can still take this medicine but your doctor may reduce the dose </li>
<li>if you have liver disease </li>
<li>if you suffer from heart failure </li>
<li>if you are taking insulin or an anti-diabetic medicine, your doctor may want to reduce your dose 
of the other anti-diabetic medicine or insulin when you take either of them together with Vipidia 
in order to avoid low blood sugar </li>
<li>if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas </li>
</ul>
<p>Contact your doctor if you encounter blistering of the skin, as it may be a sign for a condition called 
bullous pemphigoid. Your doctor may ask you to stop alogliptin. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
Vipidia is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of efficacy in 
these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vipidia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>There is no experience of using Vipidia in pregnant women or during breast-feeding. Vipidia should 
not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Your doctor will help you to decide whether to 
continue breast-feeding or to continue using Vipidia. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Vipidia is not known to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Taking Vipidia in combination 
with other anti-diabetic medicines called sulphonylureas, insulin or combination therapy with 
thiazolidinedione plus metformin can cause too low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may 
affect your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Vipidia contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
