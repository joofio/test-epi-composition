Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection.
The active substance of your medicine is called nevirapine. Nevirapine belongs to a class of anti-HIV 
medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Reverse transcriptase is an 
enzyme that HIV needs in order to multiply. Nevirapine stops reverse transcriptase from working. By 
stopping reverse transcriptase from working, Viramune helps control HIV-1 infection. 
Viramune is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age. 
You must take Viramune together with other antiretroviral medicines. Your doctor will recommend 
the best medicines for you.

if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance St. John s Wort (Hypericum 
perforatum). This herbal substance may stop Viramune from working properly.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viramune.
During the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune it is very important that you and your 
doctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. These can become severe and even life 
threatening. You are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment.
If you experience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the 
form of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as 
-
fever, 
-
blistering, 
-
mouth sores, 
-
inflammation of the eye, 
-
swelling of the face, 
-
general swelling,
-
shortness of breath, 
-
muscle or joint pain, 
-
general feelings of illness, 
-
or abdominal pain
YOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE TAKING VIRAMUNE AND YOU MUST CONTACT your 
doctor IMMEDIATELY as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death.
If you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your 
doctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking Viramune.
If you experience symptoms suggesting damage of the liver, such as 
-
loss of appetite, 
-
feeling sick (nausea), 
-
vomiting, 
-
yellow skin (jaundice), 
-
abdominal pain
you should discontinue taking Viramune and must contact your doctor immediately.
If you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking Viramune, NEVER 
TAKE VIRAMUNE again without referring to your doctor.
You must take the dose of Viramune as prescribed by your doctor. This is especially important 
within the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in  How to take Viramune ).
The following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems:
-
women
-
infected with hepatitis B or C
-
abnormal liver function tests
-
treatment-na ve patients with higher CD4 cell counts at the start of Viramune therapy (women 
more than 250 cells/mm , men more than 400 cells/mm )
-
pre-treated patients with detectable HIV-1 plasma viral load and higher CD4 cell counts at the 
start of Viramune therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm , men more than 400 cells/mm )
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (AIDS 
defining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after 
anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the 
body s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no 
obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Changes of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Contact your 
doctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4  Possible side effects ). 
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of 
combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the 
immune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this 
disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and 
shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.
If you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might 
need to check your white blood cells.
Do not take Viramune after an exposure to HIV unless you have been diagnosed with HIV and 
instructed to do so by your doctor.
Prednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to Viramune.
If you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g.  pill ) or other hormonal methods of birth control during 
treatment with Viramune, you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent 
pregnancy and further HIV transmission. 
If you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this 
medicine.
If you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before 
taking this medicine with Viramune. 
Children and adolescents
Viramune tablets can be taken by:
-
children 16 years of age or older
-
children under 16 years of age who:
-
weigh 50 kg or more 
-
or have a body surface area above 1.25 square metres. 
For smaller children an oral suspension liquid form is available.
Other medicines and Viramune
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking 
Viramune. Your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and 
adjust doses. Carefully read the package leaflet of all other HIV medicinal products you are taking in 
combination with Viramune.
It is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken:
-
St. John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression)
-
rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)
-
rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)
-
macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections)
-
fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)
-
ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)
-
itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)
-
methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts)
-
warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting)
-
hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the  pill )
-
atazanavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
-
lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
-
fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
-
efavirenz (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
-
etravirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
-
rilpivirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
-
zidovudine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
-
elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)
Your doctor will carefully monitor the effect of Viramune and any of these medicines if you are taking 
them together. 
If you are undergoing kidney dialysis, your doctor may consider a dose adjustment of Viramune. This 
is because Viramune can be partly washed out of your blood by dialysis. 
Taking Viramune with food and drink
There are no restrictions on taking Viramune with food and drink.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible
Driving and using machines
You may experience fatigue when taking Viramune. Use caution when engaging in activities such as 
driving, using any tools or machines. If you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous 
tasks such as driving or using any tools or machines.
Viramune contains lactose and sodium
Viramune tablets contain lactose (milk sugar).
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicinal product.
Viramune tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

medicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.
Dose:
The dose is one 200 mg tablet per day for the first 14 days of treatment ( lead-in  period). After days, the usual dose is one 200 mg tablet twice a day. 
It is very important that you take only one Viramune tablet a day for the first 14 days ( lead-in<br />
period). If you have any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your doctor.
The 14-day  lead-in  period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash.
As Viramune must always be taken together with other HIV antiretroviral medicines, you should 
follow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. These are supplied in the package leaflets 
for those medicines.
Viramune is also available in liquid form as an oral suspension. This is particularly suitable if:
-
you have problems swallowing tablets
-
or you are a child weighing less than 50 kg
-
or you are a child having a body surface area less than 1.25 square metres (your doctor will 
work out your surface area).
You should continue to take Viramune for as long as instructed by your doctor.
As explained in  Warnings and precautions , above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or 
for undesirable effects such as rash. Depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or 
stop your Viramune treatment. Your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose.
Only take Viramune tablets by mouth. Do not chew your tablets. You may take Viramune with or 
without food.
If you take more Viramune than you should
Do not take more Viramune than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. There is at 
present little information on the effects of Viramune overdose. Consult your doctor if you have taken 
more Viramune than you should. 
If you forget to take Viramune
Try not to miss a dose. If you notice that you have missed a dose within 8 hours of when it was due, 
take the missed dose as soon as possible. If it has been more than 8 hours since the dose was due only
take the next dose at the usual time.
If you stop taking Viramune
Taking all doses at the appropriate times:
-
greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines 
-
reduces the chances of your HIV infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines.
It is important that you continue taking Viramune correctly, as described above, unless your doctor 
instructs you to stop.
If you stop taking Viramune for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 day 
'lead-in' period (described above) once again, before returning to the twice daily dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""

  * text.status = #additional
  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As mentioned in  Warnings and precautions', above, the most important side effects of Viramune
are severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. These reactions occur 
mainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with Viramune. This is therefore an important period 
which requires close monitoring by your doctor.
If you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately.
When rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. However, in some patients a rash, which appears as 
a blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. Most of the cases of both severe rash and 
mild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment. 
If rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately.
Hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. Such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis 
(a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as:
-
rash
-
swelling of the face
-
difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm)
-
anaphylactic shock
Hypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as:
-
fever
-
blistering of your skin 
-
mouth sores
-
inflammation of the eye
-
swelling of the face
-
general swelling
-
shortness of breath
-
muscle or joint pain
-
a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia)
-
general feelings of illness
-
severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure). 
Tell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a 
hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. Such reactions can be life-threatening.
Abnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of Viramune. This includes some cases of 
inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis), and liver
failure, which can be both fatal.
Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage:
-
loss of appetite
-
feeling sick (nausea)
-
vomiting
-
yellow skin (jaundice)
-
abdominal pain 
The side effects described below have been experienced by patients given Viramune:
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):
-
rash
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):
-
decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia)
-
allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) 
-
headache
-
feeling sick (nausea)
-
vomiting
-
abdominal pain
-
loose stools (diarrhoea)
-
inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)
-
feeling tired (fatigue)
-
fever
-
abnormal liver function tests
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):
-
allergic reaction characterized by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial 
spasm) or anaphylactic shock
-
decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)
-
yellow skin (jaundice)
-
severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis)
-
hives (urticaria)
-
fluid under the skin (angioedema)
-
joint pain (arthralgia)
-
muscle pain (myalgia)
-
decreased blood phosphorus
-
increased blood pressure
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people):
-
sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)
-
drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)
The following events have also been reported when Viramune has been used in combination with 
other antiretroviral agents: 
-
decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets
-
inflammation of the pancreas
-
decrease in or abnormal skin sensations 
These events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur 
when Viramune is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are 
due to treatment with Viramune.
Additional side effects in children and adolescents
A reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. A 
reduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more 
commonly observed in children. As with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side 
effects.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of
