  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Viread contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil.  This active substance is an antiretroviral or 
antiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both.  Tenofovir is a nucleotide 
reverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by interfering with the normal 
working of an enzyme (in HIV reverse transcriptase, in hepatitis B DNA polymerase) that are 
essential for the viruses to reproduce themselves.  In HIV Viread should always be used combined 
with other medicines to treat HIV infection. </p>
<p>Viread 123 mg tablets are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. </p>
<p>Viread 123 mg tablets are for use in children.  They are only suitable for: 
* children aged 6 to less than 12 years 
* who weigh from 17 kg to less than 22 kg 
* who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective 
due to development of resistance, or have caused side effects. </p>
<p>Viread 123 mg tablets are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an infection with HBV

<p>Your child does not have to have HIV to be treated with Viread for HBV. </p>
<p>This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Viread your child may still develop 
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection.  Your child can also pass on HBV to 
others, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If your child is allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine listed in section 6.<br />
 If this applies to your child, tell their doctor immediately and don’t give Viread. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For HIV, Viread 123 mg tablets are only suitable for children who have already been treated 
with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, 
or have caused side effects. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your child’s age and weight to see if Viread 123 mg tablets are suitable, see Children 
and adolescents. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Viread does not reduce the risk of passing on HBV to others through sexual contact or blood 
contamination. You must continue to take precautions to avoid this.  </p>
<p>Talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before giving Viread. </p>
<ul>
<li>If your child has had kidney disease or if tests have shown problems with their kidneys. 
Viread should not be given to children with existing kidney problems.  Viread may affect your 
child’s kidneys during treatment.  Before starting treatment, your child’s doctor may order 
blood tests to assess your child’s kidney function.  Your child’s doctor may also order blood 
tests during treatment to monitor how your child’s kidneys work. </li>
</ul>
<p>Viread is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your child’s kidneys (see 
Other medicines and Viread).  If this is unavoidable, your child’s doctor will monitor your 
child’s kidney function once a week. </p>
<p>If your child suffers from osteoporosis, has a history of bone fracture or has problems with 
their bones. </p>
<p>Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side 
effects). Tell your child’s doctor if your child has bone pain or fractures. </p>
<p>Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone loss was 
seen in clinical studies when patients were treated with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with 
a boosted protease inhibitor. </p>
<p>Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk in 
adult and paediatric patients are uncertain.  </p>
<p>Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone 
disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). 
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many 
risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and 
pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of 
these symptoms tell your child’s doctor. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk to your child’s doctor if your child has a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.<br />
Patients with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with 
antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If your 
child has hepatitis B infection, your child’s doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for 
them.  If your child has a history of liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your child’s 
doctor may conduct blood tests to monitor their liver function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look out for infections.  If your child has advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and has an 
infection, they may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the 
symptoms of an existing infection once treatment with Viread is started.  These symptoms may 
indicate that your child’s body’s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for 
signs of inflammation or infection soon after your child starts taking Viread.  If you notice signs 
of inflammation or infection, tell your child’s doctor at once. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after your child starts taking 
medicines for the treatment of their HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment.  If you notice that your child has any symptoms of infection 
or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and 
moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform 
your child’s doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Viread 123 mg tablets are only suitable for: 
* HIV-1 infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than 
22 kg who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully 
effective due to development of resistance, or have caused side effects. </p>
<ul>
<li>HBV infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than 
22 kg </li>
</ul>
<p>Viread 123 mg tablets are not suitable for the following groups: 
* Not for children who weigh under 17 kg or 22 kg and over.  Contact your child’s doctor if your 
child is outside the permitted weight. 
* Not for children and adolescents under 6 years or 12 years and over. </p>
<p>For dosage see section 3, How to take Viread. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Viread </p>
<p>Tell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if they are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your child’s doctor when they start Viread if 
they have both HBV and HIV. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not give Viread if your child is already taking other medicines containing tenofovir 
disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide.  Do not give Viread together with medicines containing 
adefovir dipivoxil (a medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis B). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is very important to tell your child’s doctor if your child is taking other medicines that 
may damage their kidneys. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These include: 
* aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), 
* amphotericin B (for fungal infection), 
* foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), 
* interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), 
* adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), 
* tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), 
* non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Viread with other 
antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in the blood and 
may reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess 
lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported when medicines 
containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your child’s doctor will 
carefully consider whether to treat your child with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also important to tell your doctor if your child is taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Viread with food and drink </p>
<p>Give Viread with food (for example, a meal or a snack). </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding </p>
<p>If your child is pregnant or breastfeeding, or they think they may be pregnant, ask your child’s doctor 
or pharmacist for advice before they take this medicine. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your child has taken Viread during their pregnancy, your child’s doctor may request regular 
blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of the baby.  In children 
whose mothers took medicines like Viread (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the 
protection against the virus outweighed the risk of side effects. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child has HBV, and their baby has been given treatment to prevent hepatitis B 
transmission at birth, your child may be able to breast-feed their infant, but first talk to your 
child’s doctor to get more information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breast-feeding is not recommended in mothers living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk.  If your child is breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-
feeding, talk to your child's doctor as soon as possible. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Viread can cause dizziness.  If your child feels dizzy while taking Viread, they must not drive or ride 
a bicycle and must not use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>Viread contains lactose </p>
<p>Tell your child’s doctor before giving Viread.  If you have been told by your child’s doctor that 
your child has an intolerance to some sugars, contact your child’s doctor before they take this 
medicinal product. </p>
<p>Viread contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended dose is: 
* Children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than 22 kg: 
1 tablet each day with food (for example, a meal or a snack). </p>
<p>Your child’s doctor will monitor their weight. </p>
<p>Your child must always take the dose recommended by their doctor.  This is to make sure that 
their medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do 
not change the dose unless your child’s doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>For HIV, your child’s doctor will prescribe Viread with other antiretroviral medicines. </p>
<p>Refer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those 
medicines. </p>
<p>If your child takes more Viread than they should </p>
<p>If your child accidentally takes too many Viread tablets, they may be at increased risk of experiencing 
possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).  Contact your child’s 
doctor or nearest emergency department for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can 
easily describe what your child has taken. </p>
<p>If your child forgets to take Viread </p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of Viread.  If your child misses a dose, work out how long since they 
should have taken it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, they should take it as soon as they can, and 
then take their next dose at its regular time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is more than 12 hours since your child should have taken it, forget about the missed dose.<br />
Wait and give the next dose at the regular time.  Do not give a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten tablet. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child throws up less than 1 hour after taking Viread, give your child another tablet.  Your 
child does not need to take another tablet if they were sick more than 1 hour after taking Viread. </p>
<p>If your child stops taking Viread </p>
<p>Your child must not stop taking Viread without their doctor’s advice.  Stopping treatment with Viread 
may reduce the effectiveness of the treatment recommended by your child’s doctor. </p>
<p>If your child has hepatitis B or HIV and hepatitis B together (co-infection), it is very important 
not to stop their Viread treatment without talking to your child’s doctor first.  Some patients have had 
blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Viread.  Your child 
may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced 
liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of 
your child’s hepatitis. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk to your child’s doctor before your child stops taking Viread for any reason, particularly if 
your child is experiencing any side effects or they have another illness. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your child’s doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after your child stops 
treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact your child’s doctor before your child restarts taking Viread tablets. </p>
