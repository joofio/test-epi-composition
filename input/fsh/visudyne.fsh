Visudyne contains the active substance verteporfin, which is activated by light from a laser in a 
treatment called photodynamic therapy. When you are given an infusion of Visudyne, it is distributed 
within your body through the blood vessels, including the blood vessels at the back of the eye. When 
the laser light is shone into the eye, Visudyne is activated. </p>
<p>What Visudyne is used for 
Visudyne is used to treat the wet form of age-related macular degeneration and pathological myopia. </p>
<p>These diseases lead to vision loss. Vision loss is caused by new blood vessels (choroidal 
neovascularisation) that damage the retina (the light-sensitive membrane that lines the back of the 
eye). There are two types of choroidal neovascularisation: classic and occult. </p>
<p>Visudyne is used for the treatment of predominantly classic choroidal neovascularisation in adults 
with age-related macular degeneration, and also for the treatment of all types of choroidal 
neovascularisation in adults with pathological myopia. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You should not be given Visudyne 
- if you are allergic to verteporfin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
- if you have porphyria (a rare condition that may increase sensitivity to light). 
- if you have any severe liver problems. 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. You should not be given Visudyne. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Visudyne 
- If you experience any infusion-related problems or symptoms during or following the 
treatment such as chest pain, sweating, dizziness, rash, breathlessness, flushing, irregular heart 
beat or seizure, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately, as the infusion may need to be 
stopped and your condition may need to be treated urgently. Infusion-related problems may also 
include sudden loss of consciousness. 
- If you have any liver problems or a blockage of your bile duct, please tell your doctor before 
starting Visudyne therapy. 
- If, during the infusion, Visudyne goes outside the vein, and especially if the affected area is 
exposed to light, this can cause pain, swelling, blistering and a change in skin colour in the area 
of the leakage. If this happens, the infusion needs to be stopped and the skin treated with cold 
compresses and thoroughly protected from light until the skin colour returns to normal. You 
may need to take a painkiller. 
- You will be sensitive to bright light for 48 hours after the infusion. During that time, avoid 
exposure to direct sunlight, bright indoor lights such as in tanning salons, bright halogen 
lighting, high power lighting as used by surgeons or dentists, or light from light-emitting 
medical devices such as pulse oximeters (used to measure oxygen in blood). If you have to go 
outdoors during daylight in the first 48 hours after treatment, you must protect your skin and 
eyes by wearing protective clothing and dark sunglasses. Sunscreens offer no protection. 
Normal indoor lighting is safe. 
- Do not stay in the dark because exposure to normal indoor lighting will help your body to 
eliminate Visudyne more quickly. 
- If you experience any eye problems after the treatment, such as a vision loss, talk to your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Visudyne 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines, as they may increase 
your sensitivity to light:</p>
<ul>
<li>tetracyclines or sulphonamides (used to treat bacterial infection), </li>
<li>phenothiazines (used to treat psychiatric disorders, or nausea and vomiting), </li>
<li>sulfonylurea (used to treat diabetes), </li>
<li>medicines used to lower blood sugar, </li>
<li>thiazide diuretics (used to reduce high blood pressure), </li>
<li>griseofulvin (used to treat fungal infection), </li>
<li>calcium channel blockers (used to treat high blood pressure, angina and abnormal heart 
rhythms), </li>
<li>antioxidants such as beta-carotene or medicines that can remove or inactivate free radicals (such 
as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), formate, mannitol and alcohol), </li>
<li>vasodilators (used to widen blood vessels resulting from smooth muscle relaxation), </li>
<li>or, if you are undergoing radiation therapy, </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
- There is very little experience of using Visudyne in pregnant women. It is important to tell your 
doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you may be pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. 
You should only be given Visudyne if your doctor considers it absolutely essential. 
- Verteporfin passes into human milk in low amounts. Please tell your doctor if you are 
breastfeeding. He/she will decide whether you should be given Visudyne. It is recommended 
that, if you are given Visudyne, you do not breastfeed for 48 hours after administration. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
After Visudyne treatment you may have some vision problems, such as abnormal or decreased vision, 
which may be temporary. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines until your 
vision improves. </p>
<p>Visudyne contains small amounts of butylated hydroxytoluene (E321) 
This ingredient is irritant to eyes, skin and mucous membranes. If you come into direct contact with 
Visudyne, you must therefore wash it off thoroughly with water. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>
<p>First your doctor or the pharmacist will prepare the Visudyne infusion solution. It will be 
administered by your doctor or nurse into a vein using a drip (intravenous infusion). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second step is the activation of Visudyne in the eye 15 minutes after the start of the 
infusion. Your doctor will put a special contact lens onto your eye and treat your eye using a 
special laser. It takes 83 seconds to deliver the laser dose required to activate Visudyne. During 
this time, you will have to follow your doctor s instructions and keep your eyes still. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If necessary, Visudyne therapy can be repeated every 3 months, up to 4 times per year. </p>
<p>Use in children 
Visudyne is a treatment for adults only and not indicated for the use in children. </p>
<p>If you are given more Visudyne than you should be 
Overdose of Visudyne may prolong the time during which you are sensitive to light and you may need 
to follow the protection instructions given in section 2 for longer than 48 hours. Your doctor will 
advise you. </p>
<p>Overdose of Visudyne and light in the treated eye may result in severe vision decrease. </p>
