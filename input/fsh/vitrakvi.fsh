VITRAKVI contains the active substance larotrectinib.  </p>
<p>It is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat solid tumours (cancer) in various parts of the body 
that are caused by a change in the NTRK gene (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase). 
VITRAKVI is only used when 
- these cancers are advanced or have spread to other parts of the body or if a surgery to remove 
the cancer is likely to cause severe complications and 
- there are no satisfactory treatment options. </p>
<p>Before you are given VITRAKVI, your doctor will do a test to check if you have the change in the 
NTRK gene. </p>
<p>How VITRAKVI works 
In patients whose cancer is due to an altered NTRK gene, the change in the gene causes the body to 
make an abnormal protein called TRK fusion protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and 
cancer. VITRAKVI blocks the action of TRK fusion proteins and so may slow or stop the growth of 
the cancer. It may also help to shrink the cancer. </p>
<p>If you have any questions on how VITRAKVI works or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Tests and checks 
VITRAKVI can increase the amount of the liver enzymes ALT and AST and bilirubin in your blood. 
Your doctor will do blood tests before and during treatment to check the level of ALT, AST and 
bilirubin and check how well your liver is working. </p>
<p>Other medicines and VITRAKVI

medicines. This is because some medicines may affect the way VITRAKVI works or VITRAKVI may

<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not use VITRAKVI during pregnancy since the effect of VITRAKVI on the unborn is not 
known. </p>

not known if VITRAKVI passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Contraception   for men and women 
You should avoid getting pregnant while taking this medicine. 
If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment. 
You must use effective methods of contraception while taking VITRAKVI and for at least 1 month 
after the last dose, if<br />
- you are able to become pregnant. If you use hormonal contraceptives, you should also use a 
barrier method, such as a condom. 
- you have sex with a woman able to become pregnant. 
Ask your doctor about the best method of contraception for you. </p>
