This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. </p>
<p>VIZAMYL is used to help diagnose Alzheimer s disease and other causes of memory loss. It is given 
to adults with memory problems before they undergo a type of brain scan called a positron-emission 
tomography (PET) scan. This scan, along with other brain function tests, can help your doctor 
determine whether or not you may have  -amyloid plaques in your brain.  -Amyloid plaques are 
deposits sometimes present in the brains of people with dementias (such as Alzheimer s disease).  </p>
<p>You should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. </p>
<p>The use of VIZAMYL involves exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of this procedure with the 
radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to these small amounts of radiation. </p>         </div>"""

<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to flutemetamol (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given VIZAMYL if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have kidney problems </li>
<li>have liver problems </li>
<li>are pregnant or think you may be pregnant </li>
<li>are breast-feeding </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
VIZAMYL is not intended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and VIZAMYL 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines since they may interfere with the images obtained from the brain scan. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before you are given VIZAMYL if there is a possibility 
you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. When in doubt, it 
is important to consult the nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant 
The nuclear medicine doctor will only give this medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected 
which would outweigh the risks.  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding 
You must stop breast-feeding for 24 hours after the injection. Express the breast milk during this 
period and discard any breast milk you have expressed. Resuming breast-feeding should be in 
agreement with the nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  </p>
<p>You should avoid any close contact with young children for 24 hours following the injection. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
VIZAMYL may cause transient dizziness or vertigo, which may affect your ability to drive or use 
machines. You should not drive, use machines or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until 
these effects have completely disappeared. </p>
<p>VIZAMYL contains alcohol (ethanol) and sodium 
VIZAMYL contains alcohol (ethanol). Each dose contains up to 552 mg alcohol. This is about the 
same as 14 mL of beer or 6 mL of wine. This could be harmful for people with alcoholism and needs 
to be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women and people with liver problems or 
epilepsy. </p>
<p>VIZAMYL contains a maximum of 41 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
dose. This is equivalent to approximately 2% of the adult recommended maximum daily dietary intake 
for sodium  These amounts may need to be considered for people on a low sodium diet. </p>
<ol>
<li>How VIZAMYL will be used </li>
</ol>
<p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. 
VIZAMYL will only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given 
to you by professionals who are trained and qualified to use it safely. They will provide you with the 
necessary information on the procedure. </p>
<p>Your nuclear medicine doctor may ask you to drink plenty of water before the start of the examination 
and the 24 hours after the study in order to urinate as often as possible to help remove it from your 
body faster.  </p>
<p>Dose 
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of VIZAMYL to be 
used in your case. The doctor will choose the smallest amount necessary.  </p>
<p>The usual amount recommended for an adult is 185 MBq. Megabecquerel (MBq) is the unit used to 
measure radioactivity. </p>
<p>Administration of VIZAMYL and conduct of the procedure 
VIZAMYL is given as an injection into your vein (intravenous injection) followed by a flush of 
sodium chloride solution to ensure full delivery of the dose. </p>
<p>One injection is sufficient to carry out the scan that your doctor needs. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
A brain scan is usually taken 90 minutes after VIZAMYL is given. Your nuclear medicine doctor will 
inform you about the usual duration of the procedure.  </p>
<p>After administration of VIZAMYL 
You should avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for 24 hours following 
the injection. </p>
<p>The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have received more VIZAMYL than you should 
An overdose is unlikely since you will only receive a single dose of VIZAMYL from the nuclear 
medicine doctor under controlled conditions. </p>
<p>However, in the case of an overdose, you would receive the appropriate treatment. Treatment consists 
of increasing the passing of urine and stools in order to help remove radioactivity from your body. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""
