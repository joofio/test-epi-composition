with Vizimpro, as Vizimpro may cause inflammation of the lungs during treatment. 
Symptoms may be similar to those from lung cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you have 
any new or worsening symptoms including difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, or 
cough with or without phlegm (mucous), or fever. 
* If you are being treated with any of the medicines listed in section Other medicines and 
Vizimpro. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately while taking this medicine: 
* if you develop diarrhoea. Immediate treatment of diarrhoea is important. 
* if you develop skin rash. Early treatment of skin rash is important. 
* if you have any symptoms of a liver problem which may include: yellowing of your skin or

bowel movements (stools). </p>
