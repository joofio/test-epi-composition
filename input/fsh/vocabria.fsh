<p>Vocabria injection is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults aged years and over, who are also receiving another antiretroviral medicine called rilpivirine and whose

<p>Vocabria injections do not cure HIV infection; they keep the amount of virus in your body at a low 
level. This helps maintain the number of CD4 cells in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood 
cells that are important in helping your body to fight infection. </p>
<p>Vocabria injection is always given in combination with another injection of an anti-retroviral 
medicine called rilpivirine injection. Refer to the rilpivirine package leaflet for information on that

  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cabotegravir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
  if you are taking any of these medicines as they may affect the way Vocabria works:</p>
<ul>
<li>carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital (medicines to treat epilepsy and 
prevent fits). </li>
<li>rifampicin or rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you think this applies to you, tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Allergic reaction<br />
Vocabria contains cabotegravir, which is an integrase inhibitor. Integrase inhibitors including 
cabotegravir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. You need to 
know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you re receiving Vocabria.  </p>
<p>Read the information in section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Liver problems including hepatitis B and/or C 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or C. 
Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take Vocabria. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious.<br />
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you re taking Vocabria. 
These include:<br />
* symptoms of infections 
* symptoms of liver damage. </p>
<p>Read the information in section 4 of this leaflet ( Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection or liver damage: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately. Don t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor s 
advice. </p>
<p>Regular appointments are important 
It is important that you attend your planned appointments to receive your Vocabria injection, to 
control your HIV infection, and to stop your illness from getting worse. Talk to your doctor if you are 
thinking about stopping treatment. If you are late receiving your Vocabria injection, or if you stop 
receiving Vocabria, you will need to take other medicines to treat HIV infection and to reduce the risk 
of developing viral resistance.  </p>
<p>Vocabria injection is a long acting medication. If you stop treatment, low levels of cabotegravir (the 
active ingredient of Vocabria) can remain in your system for up to 12 months or more after your last 
injection. These low levels of cabotegravir will not protect you against the virus and the virus may 
become resistant. You must start a different HIV treatment within one month of your last Vocabria 
injection if you are having monthly injections, and within two months of your last Vocabria injection if 
you are having injections every two months.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not for use in children or adolescents less than 18 years of age, because it has not 
been studied in these patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vocabria injection 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines including 
other medicines bought without a prescription. </p>
<p>Vocabria must not be given with some other medicines. (see  Do not receive a Vocabria injection<br />
earlier in section 2). </p>
<p>Some medicines can affect how Vocabria works or make it more likely that you will have side 
effects. Vocabria can also affect how some other medicines work. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking: </p>
<p>rifabutin (to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking this medicine. Your doctor may decide that you 
need extra check-ups. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding  </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby: </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before receiving a Vocabria injection </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
* Vocabria is not recommended during pregnancy. If needed, your doctor will consider the 
benefit to you and the risk to your baby of receiving Vocabria injections while you're pregnant. If 
you are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor in advance 
* If you have become pregnant, do not stop attending your appointments to receive a Vocabria 
injection without consulting your doctor. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the ingredients of Vocabria injection can pass into breast milk. However, it is 
possible that cabotegravir may still pass into breast milk for 12 months after the last injection of 
Vocabria. </p>
<p>If you re breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines  </p>
<p>Vocabria can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. </p>
<p>Don t drive or use machines unless you are sure you re not affected. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are given too much Vocabria injection 
A doctor or nurse will give this medicine to you, so it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If 
you are worried, tell the doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>Don t stop receiving Vocabria injections without advice from your doctor. 
Keep receiving Vocabria injections for as long as your doctor recommends. Don t stop unless your 
doctor advises you to. If you stop, your doctor must start you on another HIV treatment within a month 
of your last Vocabria injection if you are having monthly injections, and within two months of your 
last Vocabria injection if you are having injections every two months, to reduce the risk of developing

or blood, and may tell you to stop taking Vocabria. </p>
<p>Very common side effects<br />
These may affect more than 1 in 10 people: 
* headache 
* injection site reactions. In clinical studies, these were generally mild to moderate and became 
less frequent over time. Symptoms may include: * very common: pain and discomfort, a hardened mass or lump * common: redness, itching, swelling, warmth, bruising, (which may include 
discolouration or a collection of blood under the skin) * uncommon: numbness, minor bleeding, an abscess (collection of pus) or cellulitis

* suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts (particularly in patients who have had depression or 
mental health problems before) 
* allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) 
* hives (urticaria)

* liver damage (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, loss of 
appetite, itching, tenderness of the stomach, light-coloured stools or unusually dark urine) 
* changes in liver blood tests (increase in transaminases or increase in bilirubin). </p>
<p>Other side effects that may show up in blood tests 
* an increase in lipases (a substance produced by the pancreas) </p>
<p>Other possible side effects </p>
<p>People receiving Vocabria and rilpivirine therapy for HIV may get other side effects. </p>
<p>Pancreatitis </p>
<p>If you get severe pain in the abdomen (tummy), this may be caused by inflammation of your pancreas 
(pancreatitis). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor, especially if the pain spreads and gets worse. </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation </p>
<p>People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When they start treatment, the immune system 
becomes stronger, so the body starts to fight infections. 
Symptoms of infection and inflammation may develop, caused by either: 
  old, hidden infections flaring up again as the body fights them<br />
  the immune system attacking healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). </p>
<p>The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to 
treat your HIV infection.  </p>
<p>Symptoms may include: 
  muscle weakness and/or muscle pain 
  joint pain or swelling 
  weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body 
  palpitations or tremor 
  hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement). </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection: </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately. Don t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor s 
advice. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not 
listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this
