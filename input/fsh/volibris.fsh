  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Volibris contains the active substance ambrisentan. It belongs to a group of medicines called other 
antihypertensives (used to treat high blood pressure). </p>
<p>It is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults, adolescents and children aged 
8 years and over. PAH is high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) that carry 
blood from the heart to the lungs. In people with PAH, these arteries get narrower, so the heart has to 
work harder to pump blood through them. This causes people to feel tired, dizzy and short of breath. </p>
<p>Volibris widens the pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. 
This lowers the blood pressure and relieves the symptoms. </p>
<p>Volibris may also be used in combination with other medicines used to treat PAH. </p>         </div>"""
