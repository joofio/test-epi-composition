substances called human coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and human von Willebrand factor (VWF).
Voncento is used for all age groups to prevent or to halt bleeding caused by the lack of VWF in von 
Willebrand disease (VWD) and the lack of FVIII in haemophilia A. Voncento is only used when 
treatment with another medicine, desmopressin, is not effective alone or cannot be given.
VWF and FVIII are involved in blood clotting. Lack of either factor means that blood does not clot as 
quickly as it should so there is an increased tendency to bleed. The replacement of VWF and FVIII by
Voncento will temporarily repair the blood clotting mechanisms.
As Voncento contains both FVIII and VWF, it is important to know which factor you most need. If 
you have haemophilia A your doctor will prescribe you Voncento with the number of units of 
FVIII specified. If you have VWD your doctor will prescribe you Voncento with the number of 
units of VWF specified.</p>         </div>"""

section 6). 
Warnings and precautions
Traceability
It is strongly recommended that every time Voncento is given, you record the date of administration, 
the batch number and the injected volume in your treatment diary.
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before taking Voncento.</p>
<p>Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are possible. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, you 
should stop using the medicine immediately and contact your doctor. Your doctor should 
inform you of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions. These include hives, generalised 
skin rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, fall in blood pressure and anaphylaxis (a serious 
allergic reaction that causes severe difficulty in breathing, or dizziness). </p>
<p>The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during 
treatment with all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the 
treatment working properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the 
development of these inhibitors. If your or your child s bleeding is not being controlled with 
Voncento, tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<p>If you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, tell your doctor or 
pharmacist.</p>
<p>If for the administration of Voncento you will require a central venous access device (CVAD), 
the risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteria in the blood 
(bacteremia) and the formation of a blood clot in the blood vessel (thrombosis) where the 
catheter is inserted should be considered by your doctor.</p>
<p>von Willebrand disease
If you have a known risk of developing blood clots, you must be monitored for early signs of 
thrombosis (blood clotting). Your doctor should give you treatment to prevent thrombosis.
Virus safety
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place by the 
manufacturer to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include:</p>
<p>careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections
are excluded, </p>
<p>the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections,</p>
<p>inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses.
Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the 
possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or 
emerging viruses or other types of infections.
The measures taken are considered effective for so-called  enveloped  viruses such as human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the AIDS virus), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (which cause 
inflammation of the liver), and for the  non-enveloped  hepatitis A virus (which also causes 
inflammation of the liver). 
The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious </p>
<p>for pregnant women (as there is a risk of infection of the unborn child) and </p>
<p>for individuals with a weakened immune system or with an increased production of red blood 
cells due to certain types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell anaemia or haemolytic anaemia).
Your doctor may recommend that you consider being vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if you 
regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived medicines such as Voncento.
Children and adolescents
The listed warnings and precautions apply to children and adolescents.
Other medicines and Voncento</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>During pregnancy and breast-feeding, Voncento should be given only if it is clearly needed.
Driving and using machines
Voncento does not affect your ability to drive and use machines.
Voncento contains sodium
The presentations 250 IU FVIII /600 IU VWF (5 ml solvent) and 500 IU FVIII /1200 IU VWF (5 ml 
solvent) contain up to 14.75 mg sodium per vial (main component of cooking/table salt). This is 
equivalent to 0.74 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
The presentations 500 IU FVIII /1200 IU VWF (10 ml solvent) and 1000 IU FVIII /2400 IU VWF (ml solvent) contain up to 29.50 mg  sodium per vial (main component of cooking/table salt). This is 
equivalent to 1.48% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

If your doctor thinks you could administer Voncento yourself, appropriate instructions will be 
provided to you by your doctor. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check 
with your doctor if you are not sure.
Dose
The amount of VWF and FVIII you need to take and the duration of treatment depend on:</p>
<p>the severity of your disease</p>
<p>the site and intensity of the bleeding</p>
<p>your clinical condition</p>
<p>your body weight
(see also section  The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only ).
If you have been prescribed Voncento to use at home, your doctor will make sure that you are shown 
how to inject it and how much to use.
Follow the directions given to you by your doctor.
Use in children and adolescents
Dosing in children and adolescents aged &lt; 18 years is based on body weight and is therefore generally 
based on the same instructions as for adults. In some cases, especially in younger patients, higher 
doses may be needed.
If you use more Voncento than you should 
Five cases of overdose have been reported from clinical trials. No side effects have been associated 
with these reports. The risk of developing blood clots (thrombosis) cannot be excluded in case of an 
extremely high dose, especially in patients with VWD.
If you forget to use Voncento</p>
<p>Proceed with your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Voncento
Do not stop using Voncento without consulting your doctor.
Reconstitution and application
General Instructions</p>
<p>The powder must be mixed with the solvent (liquid) and withdrawn from the vial under aseptic 
conditions.</p>
<p>Voncento must not be mixed with other medicines, diluents or solvents except those mentioned 
in section 6.<br />
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent, i.e. it might be sparkling when held up to the 
light but must not contain any obvious particles. After filtering or withdrawal (see below) the 
solution should be checked by eye, before it is used. Do not use the solution if it is visibly 
cloudy or if it contains flakes or particles.</p>
<p>Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements and as instructed by your doctor. 
Reconstitution
Without opening the vials, warm the Voncento powder and the liquid to room or body temperature. 
This can be done either by leaving the vials at room temperature for about an hour, or by holding them 
in your hands for a few minutes. 
DO NOT expose the vials to direct heat. The vials must not be heated above body temperature (37  C).
Carefully remove the protective caps from the vials, and clean the exposed rubber stoppers with an 
alcohol swab. Allow the vials to dry before opening the Mix2Vial package (which contains the filter 
transfer device), then follow the instructions given below.
1
1. Open the Mix2Vial package by peeling off the lid. Do not
remove the Mix2Vial from the blister package!
2
2. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold 
the vial tight. Take the Mix2Vial together with the blister 
package and push the spike of the blue adapter end 
straight down through the solvent vial stopper.
3
3. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial 
set by holding at the rim, and pulling vertically upwards. 
Make sure that you only pull away the blister package and 
not the Mix2Vial set.
4
4. Place the product vial on an even and firm surface. Invert 
the solvent vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and push 
the spike of the transparent adapter end straight down
through the product vial stopper. The solvent will 
automatically flow into the product vial.
5
5. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set 
and with the other hand grasp the solvent-side and unscrew 
the set carefully counterclockwise into two pieces to avoid 
excessive build-up of foam when dissolving the product. 
Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter 
attached.
6
6. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter 
attached until the substance is fully dissolved. Do not 
shake.
7
7. Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product 
vial is upright, connect the syringe to the Mix2Vial s Luer 
Lock fitting by screwing clockwise. Inject air into the 
product vial.
Withdrawal and Application
8
8. While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the 
system upside down and draw the solution into the syringe 
by pulling the plunger back slowly.
9
9. Now that the solution has been transferred into the 
syringe, firmly hold on to the barrel of the syringe 
(keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and disconnect 
the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by 
unscrewing counterclockwise.
Use the venipuncture kit supplied with the product, insert the needle into a vein. Let blood flow back 
to the end of the tube. Attach the syringe to the threaded, locking end of the venipuncture kit. The use 
of plastic disposable syringes is recommended as the ground glass surfaces of all-glass syringes tend to 
stick with solutions of this type. Inject/infuse the reconstituted solution slowly (at a rate not more 
than 6 ml per minute) into the vein following the instructions given to you by your doctor. Take care 
not to get any blood in the syringe containing the product.
In case large volumes of Voncento are required, it is possible to pool several vials of Voncento 
together, via a commercially available infusion set (e.g. a syringe pump for giving medicines into a 
vein). However, in these cases the initially reconstituted solution of Voncento should not be diluted 
any further.
Check yourself for any side effects that might happen straight away. If you have any side effects that 
might be related to the administration of Voncento, the injection or infusion should be stopped (see 
also section 2).
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
