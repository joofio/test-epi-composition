<ul>
<li>You have had an allergic reaction to other azoles. </li>
<li>You are suffering from, or have ever suffered from liver disease.  If you have liver disease, your 
doctor may prescribe a lower dose of Voriconazole Hikma. Your doctor should also monitor your 
liver function while you are being treated with Voriconazole Hikma by doing blood tests. </li>
<li>You are known to have cardiomyopathy, irregular heart beat, slow heart rate or an abnormality of 
electrocardiogram (ECG) called ‘long QTc syndrome’. </li>
</ul>
<p>You should avoid any sunlight and sun exposure while being treated.  It is important to cover sun exposed 
areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF), as an increased sensitivity of skin to 
the sun’s UV rays can occur. These precautions are also applicable to children. </p>
<p>While being treated with Voriconazole Hikma: 
* Tell your doctor immediately if you develop<br />
o sunburn 
o severe skin rash or blisters<br />
o bone pain. </p>
<p>If you develop skin disorders as described above, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who after 
consultation may decide that it is important for you to be seen on a regular basis. There is a small chance that 
skin cancer could develop with long term use of Voriconazole Hikma. </p>
<p>If you develop signs of ‘adrenal insufficiency’ where the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of 
certain steroid hormones such as cortisol which may lead to symptoms such as: chronic, or long lasting 
fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If you develop signs of ‘Cushing’s syndrome’ where the body produces too much of the hormone cortisol 
which may lead to symptoms such as: weight gain, fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, 
darkening of the skin on the stomach, thighs breasts, and arms, thinning skin, bruising easily, high blood 
sugar, excessive hair growth, excessive sweating, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor should monitor the function of your liver and kidneys by doing blood tests. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Voriconazole Hikma should not be given to children younger than 2 years of age. </p>

time should be avoided if possible:

the same time should be avoided if possible, and a dose adjustment of voriconazole may be required:

counts and side effects to rifabutin will need to be monitored. 
* Phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy).  If you are already being treated with phenytoin, your blood 
concentration of phenytoin will need to be monitored during your treatment with Voriconazole 
Hikma and your dose may be adjusted. </p>

required to check that the medicines and/or Voriconazole Hikma are still having the desired effect: </p>
