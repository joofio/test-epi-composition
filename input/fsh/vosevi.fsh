<ul>
<li>If you are allergic to sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6 of this leaflet). </li>
</ul>
<p> If this applies to you, do not take Vosevi and tell your doctor immediately. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: </li>
<li>rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); </li>
<li>St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal medicine used to treat depression); </li>
<li>carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures); </li>
<li>rosuvastatin (a medicine used to treat high blood cholesterol or decrease the risk of 
certain cardiovascular events); </li>
<li>dabigatran etexilate (a medicine used to prevent blood clots); </li>
<li>ethinylestradiol containing medicines, including many contraceptives. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you: 
* have liver problems other than from hepatitis C, for instance 
* if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely; 
* if you have had a liver transplant. 
* are taking treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vosevi if: 
* you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat 
irregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor 
may consider alternative treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Vosevi is 
needed, you may required additional heart monitoring. 
* you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or 
adjustment of your diabetes medicines after starting Vosevi. Some diabetic patients have 
experienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with 
medicines like Vosevi. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines 
for heart problems and during treatment you experience: 
* slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; 
* shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; 
* chest pain; 
* light-headedness; 
* palpitations; 
* near fainting or fainting. </p>
<p>Blood tests </p>
<p>Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Vosevi. This is so that: 
* Your doctor can decide if you should take Vosevi and for how long; 
* Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C 
virus. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age and weighing less than 30 kg. The use of 
Vosevi in these patients has not yet been studied. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Vosevi </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>If you are not sure talk to your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Some medicines must not be taken with Vosevi. Taking Vosevi with any of these may stop your 
medicines from working properly, or make any side effects worse: 
* rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); 
* St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal medicine used to treat depression); 
* carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and prevent 
seizures); 
* rosuvastatin (a medicine used to treat high blood cholesterol or decrease the risk of certain 
cardiovascular events); 
* dabigatran etexilate (a medicine used to prevent blood clots); 
* ethinylestradiol containing medicines, including many contraceptives. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: </p>
<ul>
<li>amiodarone, used to treat irregular heartbeats; </li>
<li>rifapentine (an antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); </li>
<li>oxcarbazepine (medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); </li>
<li>tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, used 
to treat HIV infection; </li>
<li>atazanavir, efavirenz or lopinavir, used to treat HIV infection; </li>
<li>digoxin, used to treat heart conditions; </li>
<li>modafinil, used to treat sleep disorders; </li>
<li>atorvastatin, pravastatin, or other statins, used to treat high cholesterol; </li>
<li>
<p>ciclosporin, used to suppress the immune system. 
Taking Vosevi with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side 
effects worse. Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine 
you are taking. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, 
heartburn or acid reflux as they can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood. These 
medicines include: </p>
</li>
<li>antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate). These should 
be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Vosevi; </li>
<li>proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and 
esomeprazole). If you need high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a 
different medicine instead or adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking; </li>
<li>
<p>H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). If you 
need high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a different medicine instead 
or adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking. 
These medicines can decrease the amount of Vosevi in your blood. If you are taking one of these 
medicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid 
reflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take warfarin or other similar medicines 
called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood. Your doctor may need to increase the 
frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. </p>
</li>
<li>Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other 
medicines (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting 
Vosevi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, are breast-feeding your baby, or are planning to have 
a baby ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Vosevi is not recommended during pregnancy. The effects of Vosevi during pregnancy are not 
known. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed during treatment with Vosevi. Some of the active substances of Vosevi may 
pass into human breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Vosevi should not affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machinery. </p>
<p>Vosevi contains lactose </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are lactose intolerant or intolerant to other sugars. Vosevi contains lactose 
monohydrate. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars 
contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Vosevi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. </p>         </div>"""

been fully tested in patients with severe kidney problems. </p>
<p>Liver problems </p>
<p>Vosevi should not be used if you have moderate or severe liver problems. </p>
<p>If you are taking an antacid, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after Vosevi. </p>
<p>If you are sick (vomit) after taking Vosevi it may affect the amount of Vosevi in your blood. This

<p>If you forget to take Vosevi </p>
<p>It is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. </p>
<p>If you do miss a dose, work out how long it is since you last took your Vosevi: 
* If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Vosevi, you must take the missed 
dose as soon as possible. Then take the next dose at your usual time. 
* If it is 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Vosevi, wait and take the next dose at 
your usual time. Do not take a double dose (two doses close together) to make up for a forgotten 
dose. </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Vosevi </p>
<p>Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. It is very important that you complete 
the full course of treatment to give the medicine the best chance to treat your hepatitis C virus 
infection. </p>
