<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to have an operation 
Your doctor will stop Votrient at least 7 days before your operation as it may affect wound healing. 
Your treatment will be restarted when the wound has adequately healed. </p>
<p>Conditions you need to look out for 
Votrient can make some conditions worse or cause serious side effects. You must look out for certain 
symptoms while you are taking Votrient to reduce the risk of any problems. See section 4.<br />
Children and adolescents 
Votrient is not recommended for people aged under 18. It is not yet known how well it works in this

taken. Please consult your doctor or nurse for advice. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of these. </p>
<p>Votrient with food and drink 
Don’t take Votrient with food, as it affects the way the medicine is absorbed. Take it at least two 
hours after a meal or one hour before a meal (see section 3).

after, to prevent pregnancy. 
- If you do become pregnant during treatment with Votrient, tell your doctor. </p>
