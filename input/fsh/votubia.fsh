for you by a doctor with experience in treating patients with TSC. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for SEGA associated with TSC, Votubia will only be prescribed by a doctor 
with experience in treating patients with SEGA and with access to blood tests which will measure how 
much Votubia is in your blood. </p>
<p>Follow all the doctor s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information contained 
in this leaflet. If you have any questions about Votubia or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your 
doctor. </p>
<p>Do not take Votubia </p>
<p>if you are allergic to everolimus, to related substances such as sirolimus or temsirolimus, or to 
any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you had allergic reactions before, please ask your doctor for advice. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Votubia: </p>
<p>if you have any problems with your liver or if you have ever had any disease which may have 
affected your liver. If this is the case, your doctor may need to prescribe a different dose of 
Votubia or stop treatment, either for a short time or permanently. </p>
<p>if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). Votubia may increase blood sugar 
levels and worsen diabetes mellitus. This may result in the need for insulin and/or oral 
antidiabetic agent therapy. Tell your doctor if you experience any excessive thirst or increased 
frequency of urination. </p>
<p>if you need to receive a vaccine while taking Votubia as vaccination may be less effective. For 
children with SEGA, it is important to have a discussion with the doctor about the childhood 
vaccination program before treatment with Votubia. </p>
<p>if you have high cholesterol. Votubia may elevate cholesterol and/or other blood fats. </p>
<p>if you have had recent major surgery, or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery. 
Votubia may increase the risk of problems with wound healing. </p>
<p>if you have an infection. It may be necessary to treat your infection before starting Votubia. </p>
<p>if you have previously had hepatitis B, because this may occur again during treatment with 
Votubia (see section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>if you have received or are about to receive radiation therapy. </p>
<p>Votubia may also: </p>
<p>cause mouth sores (oral ulcerations). </p>
<p>weaken your immune system. Therefore, you may be at risk of getting an infection while you 
are taking Votubia. If you have fever or other signs of an infection, consult with your doctor. 
Some infections may be severe and may have fatal consequences in adults and children. </p>
<p>impact your kidney function. Therefore, your doctor will monitor your kidney function while 
you are taking Votubia. </p>
<p>cause shortness of breath, cough and fever (see section 4  Possible side effects ). </p>
<p>cause complications of radiation therapy. Severe complications of radiotherapy (such as 
shortness of breath, nausea, diarrhoea, skin rashes and soreness in mouth, gums and throat), 
including fatal cases, have been observed in some patients who were taking everolimus at the 
same time as radiation therapy or who were taking everolimus shortly after they had radiation 
therapy. In addition, so-called radiation recall syndrome (comprising skin redness or lung 
inflammation at the site of previous radiation therapy) has been reported in patients who had 
radiation therapy in the past. 
Tell your doctor if you are planning to have radiation therapy in the near future, or if you have 
had radiation therapy before. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. </p>
<p>You will have blood tests before and periodically during treatment. These will check the amount of 
blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) in your body to see if Votubia is having an 
unwanted effect on these cells. Blood tests will also be carried out to check your kidney function 
(levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen or urinary protein), liver function (level of transaminases) 
and your blood sugar and lipid levels. This is because these can also be affected by Votubia. </p>
<p>If you receive Votubia for the treatment of SEGA associated with TSC, regular blood tests are also 
necessary to measure how much Votubia is in your blood since this will help your doctor decide how 
much Votubia you need to take. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Votubia can be used in children and adolescents SEGA associated with TSC. </p>
<p>Votubia is not to be used in children or adolescents with TSC who have angiomyolipoma of the 
kidney in the absence of SEGA, as it has not been studied in such patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Votubia 
Votubia may affect the way some other medicines work. If you are taking other medicines at the same 
time as Votubia, your doctor may need to change the dose of Votubia or the other medicines. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>The following may increase the risk of side effects with Votubia: </p>
<p>ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole and other antifungals used to treat 
fungal infections. </p>
<p>clarithromycin, telithromycin or erythromycin, antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. </p>
<p>ritonavir, and other medicines used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. </p>
<p>verapamil or diltiazem, used to treat heart conditions or high blood pressure. </p>
<p>dronedarone, a medicine used to help regulate your heart beat. </p>
<p>ciclosporin, a medicine used to stop the body from rejecting organ transplants. </p>
<p>imatinib, used to inhibit the growth of abnormal cells. </p>
<p>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as ramipril) used to treat high blood 
pressure or other cardiovascular problems. </p>
<p>cannabidiol (uses amongst others include treatment of seizures). </p>
<p>The following may reduce the effectiveness of Votubia: </p>
<p>rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis (TB). </p>
<p>efavirenz or nevirapine, used to treat HIV infection/AIDS. </p>
<p>St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product used to treat depression and other 
conditions. </p>
<p>dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to treat a wide variety of conditions including 
inflammatory or immune problems. </p>
<p>phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital and other anti-epileptics used to stop seizures or fits. </p>
<p>All medicines listed above should be avoided during your treatment with Votubia. If you are taking 
any of them, your doctor may switch you to a different medicine, or may change your dose of Votubia. </p>
<p>If you are taking an anti-seizure medicine, a change in the dose of the anti-seizure medicine (increase 
or decrease) may make a change in the Votubia dose necessary. Your doctor will decide this. If the 
dose of your anti-seizure medicine changes, please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Votubia with food and drink 
Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while you are on Votubia. It may increase the amount of Votubia 
in the blood, possibly to a harmful level. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy 
Votubia could harm an unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. Tell your doctor if 
you are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant. </p>
<p>Women who could potentially become pregnant must use highly effective contraception during 
treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment. If, despite these measures, you think you may 
have become pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before taking any more Votubia. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Votubia could harm a breast-fed baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment and for 2 weeks 
after the last dose of Votubia. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Votubia may affect male and female fertility. Talk to your doctor if you wish to have children. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
If you feel unusually tired (fatigue is a common side effect), take special care when driving or using 
machines. </p>
<p>Votubia contains lactose 
Votubia contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an 
intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. </p>         </div>"""

combination of both. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>How much Votubia to take 
If you receive Votubia for the treatment of TSC with angiomyolipoma of the kidney, the usual dose is 
10 mg, to be taken once daily. </p>
<p>A higher or lower dose may be recommended by your doctor based on your individual treatment 
needs, for example if you have problems with your liver or if you are taking certain other medicines in 
addition to Votubia. </p>
<p>If you receive Votubia for the treatment of TSC with SEGA, your doctor will determine the dose of 
Votubia you need to take depending on: </p>
<p>your age </p>
<p>your body size </p>
<p>the health of your liver </p>
<p>other medicines you are taking. </p>
<p>You will have blood tests during treatment with Votubia. This is to measure the amount of Votubia in 
your blood and find the best daily dose for you. </p>
<p>If you experience certain side effects (see section 4) while you are taking Votubia, your doctor may 
lower your dose or stop treatment, either for a short time or permanently. </p>
<p>How to take this medicine </p>

<p>Take them at the same time every day. </p>
<p>You can take them either with or without food, but you need to do this in the same way each 
day. </p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the tablets. If you are taking 
Votubia tablets for the treatment of TSC with SEGA and if you are unable to swallow the tablets, you 
can stir them into a glass of water: </p>
<p>Put the required number of tablets into a glass of water (approximately 30 ml). </p>
<p>Gently stir the contents of the glass until the tablets break apart (approximately 7 minutes) and 
then drink the contents immediately. </p>
<p>Refill the glass with the same amount of water (approximately 30 ml), gently stir the remaining 
content and drink the whole amount to make sure that you get the full dose of Votubia tablets. </p>
<p>If necessary, drink additional water to wash out any residues in your mouth. </p>
<p>Special information for caregivers 
Caregivers are advised to avoid contact with suspensions of Votubia tablets. Wash hands thoroughly 
before and after preparation of the suspension. </p>
<p>If you take more Votubia than you should </p>
<p>If you have taken too much Votubia, or if someone else accidentally takes your tablets, see a 
doctor or go to a hospital immediately. Urgent treatment may be necessary. </p>
<p>Take the carton and this leaflet, so that the doctor knows what has been taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Votubia 
If you miss a dose, take your next dose as scheduled. Do not take a double dose to make up for the 
forgotten tablets. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Votubia 
Do not stop taking Votubia tablets unless your doctor tells you to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
