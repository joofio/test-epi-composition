Voxzogo contains the active substance vosoritide. It is similar to a protein in the body called C type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP). Vosoritide is made by recombinant technology involving bacteria that have 
been modified to include the gene for producing the protein.  </p>
<p>What Voxzogo is used for 
This medicine is used for the treatment of achondroplasia in patients 4 months of age and older whose 
bones are still growing. Achondroplasia is a genetic condition that affects growth of almost all bones 
in the body including the skull, spine, arms and legs resulting in very short stature with a characteristic 
appearance. </p>
<p>The product is indicated only in achondroplasia which is caused by mutations in the FGFR3-gene as 
confirmed by genetic testing. </p>
<p>How does Voxzogo work 
The active substance in Voxzogo works directly on the growth points of your bones to promote new 
bone growth. </p>         </div>"""

- if you or your child are allergic to vosoritide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>

<ul>
<li>If you or your child have significant heart disease or blood pressure problems.  </li>
<li>If you or your child are taking or have recently taken medicines that lower blood pressure. 
If any of these applies to you or your child or you are unsure, talk to the doctor before using Voxzogo. </li>
</ul>
<p>Blood pressure effects 
Voxzogo can lower blood pressure. As a result, you may feel dizzy, nauseous, or tired. Blood pressure 
usually returns to normal within 90 minutes of Voxzogo injection. If these effects occur and are 
severe, tell your doctor.<br />
Drinking plenty of fluids at the time of injection may reduce the likelihood of these effects. It is 
recommended patients eat a light snack and drink enough fluid (e.g. water, milk or juice) about 
30 minutes before injection. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
There is not enough information on the use of this medicine in children under 4 months old and 
therefore it is not recommended. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Voxzogo 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you or your child are being treated with this medicine and are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you 
may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>The use of this medicine is not recommended during pregnancy and breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Driving, cycling and using machines<br />
This medicine may cause you to feel dizzy, light-headed, tired or you may feel sick shortly after your 
injection. If this happens, you should not drive, ride a bicycle, do physical activities or use machines 
for around an hour after injection or until you feel better. </p>
<p>Voxzogo contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free . </p>         </div>"""
