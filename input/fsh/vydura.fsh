called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). People with migraine may have increased levels of 
CGRP. Rimegepant attaches to the receptor for CGRP, reducing the ability of CGRP to also attach to 
the receptor. This reduces the activity of CGRP and has two effects: 
1) it can stop an active migraine attack, and 
2) it can decrease the number of migraine attacks that occur when taken preventively. </p>
