Vyndaqel is a medicine which treats a disease called transthyretin amyloidosis Transthyretin 
amyloidosis is caused by a protein called transthyretin (TTR) that does not work properly. TTR is a 
protein that carries other substances, such as hormones, through the body.
In patients with this disease, TTR breaks up and may form fibres called amyloid. Amyloid can build 
up around your nerves (known as transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy or ATTR-PN) and in other 
places in your body. The amyloid causes the symptoms of this disease. When this occurs, it prevents
them from working normally. 
Vyndaqel, can prevent TTR from breaking up and forming amyloid. This medicine is used to treat 
adult patients with this disease whose nerves have been affected (people with symptomatic
polyneuropathy) to delay further progression.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vyndaqel.</p>
<p>Women that can become pregnant should use birth control while taking Vyndaqel and should 
continue using birth control for one month after stopping treatment with Vyndaqel. There are no 
data on the use of Vyndaqel in pregnant women.
Children and adolescents
Children and adolescents do not have the symptoms of transthyretin amyloidosis. Vyndaqel is 
therefore not used for children and adolescents.
Other medicines and Vyndaqel

medicines.
You should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:
-
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

diuretic medicines (e.g. furosemide, bumetanide) 
-
anti-cancer medicines (e.g. methotrexate, imatinib)

<p>If you are able to become pregnant, you must use birth control during treatment and for

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.
The recommended dose is one Vyndaqel 20 mg (tafamidis meglumine) capsule taken once a day.
If you vomit after taking this medicine and can identify the intact Vyndaqel capsule, then an additional 
dose of Vyndaqel should be taken in the same day; if you cannot identify the Vyndaqel capsule, then 
no additional dose of Vyndaqel is necessary, and you can resume taking Vyndaqel the next day as 
usual.
Method of administration
Vyndaqel is for oral use.
The soft capsule should be swallowed whole, not crushed or cut.
The capsule may be taken with or without food.
Instructions for opening the blisters</p>
<p>Tear off one individual blister from the blister card along the perforated line.</p>
<p>Push capsule through the aluminium foil.
If you take more Vyndaqel than you should
You should not take more capsules than your doctor tells you to. If you take more capsules than you 
have been told to take, contact your doctor.
If you forget to take Vyndaqel
If you forget to take a dose, take your capsules as soon as you remember. If it is within 6 hours before
your next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double 
dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Vyndaqel
Do not stop taking Vyndaqel without first speaking to your doctor. As Vyndaqel works by stabilising 
the TTR protein, if you stop taking Vyndaqel, the protein will no longer be stabilised, and your disease 
may progress.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
