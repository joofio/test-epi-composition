  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Vyvgart is 
Vyvgart contains the active substance efgartigimod alfa. Efgartigimod alfa binds to and blocks a 
protein in the body called neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). By blocking FcRn, efgartigimod alfa decreases 
the level of IgG autoantibodies which are proteins of the immune system that attack parts of a person s 
own body by mistake. </p>
<p>What Vyvgart is used for 
Vyvgart is used together with standard therapy to treat adults with generalised Myasthenia Gravis 
(gMG), an autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness. gMG can affect multiple muscle groups 
throughout the body. The condition can also lead to shortness of breath, extreme fatigue and 
difficulties swallowing. </p>
<p>In patients with gMG, IgG autoantibodies attack and damage proteins on nerves called acetylcholine 
receptors. Because of this damage, the nerves are not able to make the muscles contract as well as 
normal, leading to muscle weakness and difficulty moving. By binding to the FcRn protein and 
reducing autoantibody levels, Vyvgart can improve the ability of muscles to contract and reduce the 
symptoms of the disease and their impact on daily activities. </p>         </div>"""
