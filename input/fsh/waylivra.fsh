  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Waylivra contains the active substance volanesorsen, which helps to treat a condition called familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). FCS is a genetic disease which gives rise to abnormally high 
levels of fats called triglycerides in the blood. This can lead to inflammation of your pancreas, causing 
severe pain. Together with a controlled low-fat diet, Waylivra helps to lower the levels of triglycerides 
in your blood. </p>
<p>Waylivra may be given after you have already received other medicines used to lower the levels of 
triglycerides in blood without them having much effect. </p>
<p>You will only be given Waylivra if genetic testing has confirmed you have FCS and your risk for 
pancreatitis is considered very high.. </p>
<p>You should continue the very low-fat diet that your doctor has prescribed during treatment with 
Waylivra.  </p>
<p>This medicine is intended for patients aged 18 years and above. </p>         </div>"""

if you are allergic to volanesorsen or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 
6). 
if you have a condition called thrombocytopenia, which means that you have a very low number 
of platelets in your blood (less than 140 x 109/L). You may notice this if you have an injury 
which causes bleeding and it takes a long time to stop (more than 5-6 minutes for a skin 
scratch). Your doctor will test for this before treatment with this medicine is started. You may 
not know that you have this condition until this point, or what might have caused it. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before 
using Waylivra. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Waylivra if you have or have had any of the 
following medical problems: 
Very high triglyceride levels which are not due to FCS. 
A low number of platelets, a type of cell in your blood that clump together to help it clot 
(thrombocytopenia); your doctor will do a blood test before you start using this medicine to 
check the number of platelets in your blood.<br />
Any liver or kidney problems. </p>
<p>Blood tests 
Your doctor will do a blood test before you start using this medicine to check the number of platelets, 
and then at regular intervals once you have started using Waylivra to check on platelet levels.<br />
You should see your doctor immediately if you have any signs of low platelet levels, such as unusual 
or prolonged bleeding, patches of red appearing on the skin (called petechiae), unexplained bruising, 
bleeding which will not stop, or nosebleeds, or if you get neck stiffness or a severe headache. </p>
<p>Your doctor may also do a blood test every 3 months to check for signs of damage to your liver. You 
should see your doctor immediately if you have any signs of liver damage, such as yellowing of your 
skin and eyeballs, pain or swelling in your abdomen, feeling or being sick, confusion or a general 
feeling of being unwell. </p>
<p>If necessary, your doctor may change how often you use this medicine, or may stop it for a period. It 
may be necessary to consult a doctor specialising in blood disorders to determine whether you should 
continue treatment with Waylivra or not. </p>
<p>Urine tests 
Your doctor may do a urine and/or blood test every 3 months to check for signs of damage to your 
kidneys. You should see your doctor immediately if you have any signs of kidney damage, such as 
swelling in your ankles, legs and feet, passing smaller amounts of urine than usual, shortness of breath, 
feeling sick, confusion or feeling very tired or drowsy. </p>
<p>Diet 
Before starting this medicine, you should be on a diet designed to help lower triglyceride levels in 
your blood.  </p>
<p>It is important that you maintain this triglyceride-lowering diet whilst using Waylivra. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not use Waylivra if you are under 18 years old. Waylivra has not been studied in patients under years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Waylivra 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. It is important to tell your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the following: 
Medicines to prevent blood clots, e.g., acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamol or warfarin. 
Other medicines that may change how your blood clots, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicines like ibuprofen, medicines used to prevent heart attacks and strokes such as 
clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel, antibiotics such as penicillin, medicines such as 
ranitidine (used to reduce stomach acid), and quinine (used to treat malaria). 
Medicines that may cause problems with your liver, such as paracetamol. </p>
<p>Waylivra with alcohol 
The effect of using Waylivra with alcohol is not known. You should avoid alcohol during treatment 
with this medicine due to risk of liver issues. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of 
Waylivra during pregnancy. 
It is not known if Waylivra passes into breast milk. It is recommended that you discuss breast-feeding 
with your doctor to see what is best for you and your child. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Waylivra is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. </p>
<p>Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""
