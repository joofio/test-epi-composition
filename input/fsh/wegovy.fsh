  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Wegovy is 
Wegovy is a medicine for weight loss and weight maintenance that contains the active substance 
semaglutide. It is similar to a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released 
from the intestine after a meal. It works by acting on targets (receptors) in the brain that control your 
appetite, causing you to feel fuller and less hungry and experience less craving for food. This will help 
you eat less food and reduce your body weight. </p>
<p>What Wegovy is used for 
Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight loss and to help keep the weight 
under control. It is used in adults, who have 
* a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or 
* a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) who have weight-related health 
problems (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood, breathing 
problems during sleep called ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’ or a history of heart attack, stroke or 
blood vessel problems). </p>
<p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. </p>
<p>Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight management in adolescents ages 
12 years and above, who have 
* obesity and 
* body weight &gt;60 kg. </p>
<p>As an adolescent patient, you should only continue using Wegovy if you have lost at least 5% of your 
BMI after 12 weeks on the 2.4 mg dose or maximum tolerated dose (see section 3). Consult your 
doctor before you continue. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Wegovy 
* if you are allergic to semaglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Wegovy.  </p>
<p>The use of Wegovy is not recommended if you: 
* use other products for weight loss, 
* have type 1 diabetes, 
* have severely reduced kidney function, 
* have severely reduced liver function, 
* have severe heart failure, 
* have diabetic eye disease (retinopathy). </p>
<p>There is little experience with Wegovy in patients: 
* of 75 years and older, 
* with liver problems, 
* with severe stomach or gut problem which results in delayed stomach emptying (called 
gastroparesis), or if you have an inflammatory bowel disease. </p>
<p>Please consult your doctor if one of the above applies to you. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dehydration 
During treatment with Wegovy, you may feel sick (nausea) or be sick (vomiting), or have 
diarrhoea. These side effects can cause dehydration (loss of fluids). It is important that you 
drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration. This is especially important if you have kidney 
problems. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflammation of the pancreas 
If you have severe and on-going pain in the stomach area (see section 4) – see a doctor straight 
away as this could be a sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with type 2 diabetes 
Wegovy cannot be used as a substitute for insulin. Do not use Wegovy in combination with 
other medicines that contain GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide 
or lixisenatide). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Taking a sulfonylurea or an insulin with Wegovy might increase the risk of getting low blood 
sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). Please see section 4 for the warning signs of low blood sugar 
levels. Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar levels. This will help your doctor 
decide if the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin needs to be changed to reduce the risk of low 
blood sugar. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diabetic eye disease (retinopathy) 
If you have diabetic eye disease and are using insulin, this medicine may lead to a worsening of 
your vision, and this may require treatment. Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead 
to a temporary worsening of diabetic eye disease. If you have diabetic eye disease and 
experience eye problems while taking this medicine, talk to your doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of Wegovy in children below 12 years of age have not been studied and are 
not recommended for use in this population. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Wegovy 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using medicines containing the following:<br />
* Warfarin or other similar medicines taken by mouth to reduce blood clotting (oral anti-
coagulants). When you start treatment with e.g. wafarin or similar medicines, frequent blood 
testing to determine the ability of your blood to clot may be required. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine should not be used during pregnancy, as it is not known if it may affect your unborn 
child. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception while using this medicine. If you wish to 
become pregnant, you should stop using this medicine at least two months in advance. If you become 
or are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby when using this medicine, 
talk to your doctor straight away, as your treatment will need to be stopped. </p>
<p>Do not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding, as it is unknown if it passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Wegovy is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Some patients may feel dizzy 
when taking Wegovy mainly during the first 4 months of treatment (see section 4). If you feel dizzy be 
extra careful while driving or using machines. If you need any further information, talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. </p>
<p>People with type 2 diabetes 
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar 
(hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using 
machines if you get any signs of low blood sugar. See section 2, ‘Warnings and precautions’ for 
information on increased risk of low blood sugar and section 4 for the warning signs of low blood 
sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.  </p>
<p>Wegovy contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. </p>         </div>"""
