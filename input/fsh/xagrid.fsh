development of platelets. It reduces the number of platelets produced by the bone marrow, which 
results in a decrease in the platelet count in the blood towards a more normal level. For this reason, it 
is used to treat patients with essential thrombocythaemia.
Essential thrombocythaemia is a condition which occurs when the bone marrow produces too many of 
the blood cells known as platelets. Large numbers of platelets in the blood can cause serious problems 
with blood circulation and clotting.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Xagrid:</p>
<p>If you have or think you might have a problem with your heart;</p>
<p>If you were born with or have family history of prolonged QT interval (seen on ECG, electrical 
recording of the heart), or you are taking other medicines that result in abnormal ECG changes 
or if you have low levels of electrolytes e.g., potassium, magnesium or calcium (see section 
 Other medicines and Xagrid );</p>
<p>If you have any problems with your liver or kidneys.
In combination with acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain 
and lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin), there is an increased risk 
of major haemorrhages (bleeding) (see section  Other medicines and Xagrid ).
While taking Xagrid, you should take the exact dose prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking the 
medicine without first talking to your doctor. Do not abruptly stop taking this medicine without 
consulting your doctor.   Abrupt withdrawal of medicine may lead to increased risk of stroke.
Signs and symptoms of stroke may include sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or 
leg, especially on one side of the body, sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty 
understanding speech, sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes, sudden trouble walking, 
dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination and sudden severe headache with no known 
cause. Please seek immediate medical help.

medicine should be used with caution.
