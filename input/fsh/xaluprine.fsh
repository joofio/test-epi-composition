ALL). This is a fast-growing disease which increases the number of new white blood cells.  These new 
white blood cells are immature (not fully formed) and unable to grow and work properly.  They 
therefore cannot fight infections and may cause bleeding. </p>

<li>Do not take Xaluprine if you are allergic to mercaptopurine or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
<li>Do not get vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine whilst you are taking Xaluprine because it 
may be fatal. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xaluprine 
- if you have been vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine 
- if you have kidney or liver problems, as your doctor will need to check that they are working 
properly. 
- if you have a condition where your body produces too little of the enzyme called TPMT 
(thiopurine methyltransferase), as your doctor may need to adjust the dose.<br />
- if you are planning to have a baby.  This applies to both men and women.  Xaluprine may harm 
your sperm or eggs (see  Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  below).   </p>
<p>If you are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, taking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>tumours, including skin cancer. Therefore, when taking Xaluprine, avoid excessive exposure to 
sunlight, wear protective clothing and use protective sunscreen with a high protection factor </li>
<li>lymphoproliferative disorders * 
treatment with Xaluprine increases your risk of getting a type of cancer called 
lymphoproliferative disorder. With treatment regimen containing multiple 
immunosuppressants (including thiopurines), this may lead to death. * 
A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the 
risk of disorders of the lymph system due to a viral infection (Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders). </li>
</ul>
<p>Taking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a serious condition called Macrophage Activation Syndrome (excessive activation 
of white blood cells associated with inflammation), which usually occurs in people who have 
certain types of arthritis. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have received 6-mercaptopurine have developed 
a rare and aggressive type of cancer called Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (see section 4, Possible 
side effects).  </p>
<p>Infections 
When you are treated with Xaluprine the risk of viral, fungal and bacterial infections is increased and 
the infections may be more serious. See also section </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Tell your doctor before starting treatment whether or not you have had chickenpox, shingles or 
hepatitis B (a liver disease caused by a virus). </p>
<p>NUDT15-gene mutation 
If you have an inherited mutation in the NUDT15-gene (a gene which is involved in the break-down 
of Xaluprine in the body), you have a higher risk of infections and hair loss and your doctor may in 
this case give you a lower dose. </p>
<p>Avoid contact of Xaluprine with your skin, eyes or nose. If you accidentally get some in your eyes or 
nose, flush the area with water. </p>
<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Xaluprine. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Low blood sugar has sometimes been seen in children, mainly in children under the age of six or with 
a low body mass index. Talk to your child s doctor if this happens. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xaluprine 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) - when used with Xaluprine there is a greater chance 
of side effects, such as anaemia </li>
<li>allopurinol or febuxostat (used to treat gout) </li>
<li>oral anticoagulants (used to thin the blood) </li>
<li>olsalazine or mesalazine (used for a bowel disorder called ulcerative colitis) </li>
<li>sulfasalazine (used for rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis). </li>
<li>anti-epileptic medicines such as phenytoin, carbamazepine. Blood levels of anti-epileptic 
medicines may need to be monitored and doses adjusted if necessary. </li>
</ul>
<p>Having vaccines while you are taking Xaluprine 
If you are going to have a vaccination it is important to speak to your doctor or nurse before you have 
it.  Vaccination with live vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) is not recommended, as 
these vaccines may give you an infection if you have them whilst you are taking Xaluprine.  </p>
<p>Xaluprine with food and drink 
Xaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach. However, the choice of method should be 
consistent from day to day.  </p>
<p>Do not take Xaluprine at the same time as milk or dairy products, as they can make the medicine less 
effective.  Xaluprine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Do not take Xaluprine if you are planning to have a baby without first speaking to your doctor for 
advice.  This applies to both men and women.  Xaluprine may harm your sperm or eggs.  Reliable 
contraception must be used to avoid pregnancy whilst you or your partner are taking Xaluprine.  Both 
men and women should continue to use effective contraception for at least 3 months after stopping 
treatment.  If you are already pregnant, you must talk to your doctor before taking Xaluprine.  </p>
<p>Xaluprine should not be handled by women who are or planning to be pregnant or breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while taking Xaluprine.  Ask your doctor, pharmacist or midwife for advice. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that Xaluprine will affect your ability to drive or use machines but no studies have 
been done to confirm this. </p>
<p>Xaluprine contains aspartame, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), sodium ethyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E215) and sucrose 
This medicine contains 3 mg aspartame (E951) in each 1 ml. Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. 
It may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine 
builds up because the body cannot remove it properly.  </p>
<p>Xaluprine also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E215) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).  </p>
<p>Xaluprine contains sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some 
sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. May be harmful to the teeth. </p>         </div>"""

problems.  </p>
<ul>
<li>When you take Xaluprine your doctor will take regular blood tests. This is to check the number 
and type of cells in your blood and to ensure your liver is working correctly. </li>
<li>Your doctor may also ask for other blood and urine tests to monitor your uric acid levels. Uric 
acid is a natural body chemical, levels of which can rise while taking Xaluprine. </li>
<li>Your doctor may sometimes change your dose of Xaluprine as a result of these tests. </li>
</ul>
<p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual starting dose for adults, adolescents and children is 
between 25-75 mg/m2 body surface area each day. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. 
Sometimes the doctor may change your dose of Xaluprine for example as a result of different tests. If 
you are not sure how much medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>It is important to take Xaluprine in the evening to make the medicine more effective. </p>
<p>You can take your medicine with food or on an empty stomach but the choice of method should be 
consistent from day to day. You should take your medicine at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
having milk or dairy products. </p>
<p>Your pack of Xaluprine contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes 
(a 1 ml syringe and a 5 ml syringe). Always use the syringes provided to take your medicine. </p>
<p>It is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist 
will advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed.  </p>
<p>The smaller 1 ml syringe, marked from 0.1 ml to 1 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or equal to 
1 ml. You should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 1 ml (each 
graduation of 0.1 ml contains 2 mg of mercaptopurine).<br />
The larger 5 ml syringe, marked 1 ml to 5 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 1 ml. You should 
use this one if the total amount you have to take is more than 1 ml (each graduation of 0.2 ml contains 
4 mg of mercaptopurine). </p>
<p>If you are a parent or care giver administering the medicine, wash your hands before and after 
administering a dose. Wipe up spillages immediately. To decrease the risk of exposure disposable 
gloves should be used when handling Xaluprine. </p>
<p>If Xaluprine comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, it should be washed immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. </p>
<p>When you use the medicine follow the instructions below: </p>
<ol>
<li>Put on disposable hand gloves before handling Xaluprine. </li>
<li>Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 30 seconds to ensure the medicine is well mixed 
(figure 1). </li>
<li>Remove the bottle cap (figure 2) and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle and leave in 
place for future doses (figure 3).  </li>
<li>Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor (figure 4). Your doctor or 
pharmacist will advise you of the correct syringe to use, either the 1 ml or the 5 ml  in order to 
give the correct dose.  </li>
<li>Turn the bottle upside down (figure 5).  </li>
<li>Pull the plunger of the syringe back so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the syringe. 
Pull the plunger back to the point on the scale that corresponds to the dose prescribed (figure 5). If 
you are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the syringe, always ask your doctor or nurse 
for advice.  </li>
<li>Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, holding it 
by the barrel rather than the plunger.  </li>
<li>Gently put the tip of the syringe into your mouth and to the inside of your cheek.  </li>
<li>Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of your cheek 
and swallow it. DO NOT forcefully push down the plunger, or squirt the medicine to the back of your 
mouth or throat, as you may choke.  </li>
<li>Remove the syringe from your mouth.  </li>
<li>Swallow the dose of oral suspension then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in 
your mouth. </li>
<li>Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place.  Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. </li>
<li>Wash the syringe with warm water and rinse well. Hold the syringe under water and move the 
plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the syringe is clean. Let the syringe air 
dry completely before you use that syringe again for dosing. Do not wipe dry. Store the syringe in a 
hygienic place with the medicine. </li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat the above for each dose as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist.  </p>
<p>If you take more Xaluprine than you should 
If you take more Xaluprine than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital immediately.  You 
may feel sick, vomit or have diarrhoea. Take the medicine pack and this leaflet with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Xaluprine 
Tell your doctor.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Xaluprine 
Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to or you may get a relapse of your 
condition. </p>
