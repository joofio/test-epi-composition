- you have been diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (a group of conditions that

Xarelto reduces the risk in adults of having another heart attack or reduces the risk of

such as prasugrel or ticagrelor other than acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel/ticlopidine. </p>
<p>Take special care with Xarelto 
* if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case in situations such as: </p>
<p>severe kidney disease, since your kidney function may affect the amount of medicine that 
works in your body </p>
<p>if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, 
apixaban or heparin), when changing anticoagulant treatment or while getting heparin 
through a venous or arterial line to keep it open (see section  Other medicines and 
Xarelto ) </p>

<p>very high blood pressure, not controlled by medical treatment </p>
<p>diseases of your stomach or bowel that might result in bleeding, e.g. inflammation of the

immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed. </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Xarelto. Your doctor will decide, 
if you should be treated with this medicine and if you should be kept under closer observation.  </p>
<p>If you need to have an operation 
* it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the operation exactly at the times you have 
been told by your doctor. 
* If your operation involves a catheter or injection into your spinal column (e.g. for epidural or 
spinal anaesthesia or pain reduction): </p>
<p>it is very important to take Xarelto before and after the injection or removal of the catheter 
exactly at the times you have been told by your doctor </p>
<p>tell your doctor immediately if you get numbness or weakness of your legs or problems 
with your bowel or bladder after the end of anaesthesia, because urgent care is necessary. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Xarelto 2.5 mg tablets are not recommended for people under 18 years of age. There is not enough 
information on their use in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xarelto

medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

 Warnings and Precautions ))  </p>
<p>anti-inflammatory and pain relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid) </p>
<p>dronedarone, a medicine to treat abnormal heart beat </p>
<p>some medicines to treat depression (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or 
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)) </p>
<p>If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of 
Xarelto may be increased. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with this medicine 
and if you should be kept under closer observation.<br />
If your doctor thinks that you are at increased risk of developing stomach or bowel ulcers, he 
may also use a preventative ulcer treatment.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are taking </li>
</ul>
<p>some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) </p>

If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Xarelto, because the effect of 
Xarelto may be reduced. Your doctor will decide, if you should be treated with Xarelto and if 
you should be kept under closer observation.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast---feeding 
Do not take Xarelto if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you could become 
pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Xarelto. If you become pregnant while you 
are taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately, who will decide how you should be treated. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Xarelto may cause dizziness (common side effect) or fainting (uncommon side effect) (see section 4, 
 Possible side effects ). You should not drive, ride a bicycle or use any tools or machines if you are 
affected by these symptoms.  </p>

if you are not sure.  </p>
<p>How much to take 
The recommended dose is one 2.5 mg tablet twice a day. Take Xarelto around the same time every day 
(for example, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). This medicine can be taken with or 
without food.  </p>
<p>If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Xarelto. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take 
it.<br />
If necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Xarelto tablet through a stomach tube. </p>
<p>Xarelto will not be given to you on its own. 
Your doctor will also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid.<br />
If you get Xarelto after an acute coronary syndrome, your doctor may tell you to also take clopidogrel 
or ticlopidine. 
If you get Xarelto after a procedure to open a narrowed or closed artery of your leg to restore blood 
flow, your doctor may also prescribe clopidogrel for you to take in addition to acetylsalicylic acid for a 
short while. </p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much of these to take (usually between 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid 
daily or a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid plus a daily dose of either 75 mg clopidogrel 
or a standard daily dose of ticlopidine). </p>
<p>When to start Xarelto 
Treatment with Xarelto after an acute coronary syndrome should be started as soon as possible after 
stabilisation of the acute coronary syndrome, at the earliest 24 hours after admission to hospital and at 
the time when parenteral (via injection) anticoagulation therapy would normally be stopped. 
Your doctor will tell you when to start treatment with Xarelto if you have been diagnosed with 
coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. 
Your doctor will decide how long you must continue treatment. </p>
<p>If you take more Xarelto than you should 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Xarelto tablets. Taking too much Xarelto 
increases the risk of bleeding.  </p>
<p>If you forget to take Xarelto<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If you miss a dose, take your next dose at the 
usual time. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Xarelto 
Take Xarelto on a regular basis and for as long as your doctor keeps prescribing it.  </p>
<p>Do not stop taking Xarelto without talking to your doctor first. If you stop taking this medicine, it may 
increase your risk of having another heart attack or stroke or dying from a disease related to your heart 
or your blood vessels. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
