XELJANZ is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases:</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>psoriatic arthritis</p>
<p>ulcerative colitis</p>
<p>ankylosing spondylitis</p>
<p>polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
XELJANZ is used to treat adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, a 
long-term disease that mainly causes pain and swelling of your joints.
XELJANZ is used together with methotrexate when previous rheumatoid arthritis treatment was not 
sufficient or was not well tolerated. XELJANZ can also be taken on its own in those cases where 
methotrexate treatment is not tolerated or treatment with methotrexate is not advised.
XELJANZ has been shown to reduce pain and swelling of the joints and improve the ability to 
perform daily activities, when given on its own or together with methotrexate.
Psoriatic arthritis
XELJANZ is used to treat adult patients with a condition called psoriatic arthritis. This condition is an 
inflammatory disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic 
arthritis you will be first given another medicine to treat your psoriatic arthritis. If you do not respond 
well enough or the medicine is not tolerated, you may be given XELJANZ to reduce the sign and 
symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis and improve the ability to perform daily activities. 
XELJANZ is used together with methotrexate to treat adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. 
Ankylosing spondylitis
XELJANZ is used to treat a condition called ankylosing spondylitis. This condition is an inflammatory 
disease of the spine.
If you have ankylosing spondylitis, you may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given XELJANZ. XELJANZ can help to reduce back pain, and 
improve physical function. These effects can ease your normal daily activities and so improve your 
quality of life.
Ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large bowel. XELJANZ is used in adult patients to 
reduce the signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis when you did not respond well enough or were 
intolerant to previous ulcerative colitis treatment.
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis
XELJANZ is used for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis a long-term 
disease that mainly causes pain and swelling of your joints, in patients 2 years of age and older.
XELJANZ is also used for the treatment of juvenile psoriatic arthritis, a condition that is an 
inflammatory disease of the joints often accompanied by psoriasis, in patients 2 years of age and older.
XELJANZ can be used together with methotrexate when previous treatment for polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis or juvenile psoriatic arthritis was not sufficient or was not well tolerated. 
XELJANZ can also be taken on its own in those cases where methotrexate treatment is not tolerated or 
treatment with methotrexate is not advised.</p>         </div>"""

section 6)
-
if you have a severe infection such as bloodstream infection or active tuberculosis 
-
if you have been informed that you have severe liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of 
the liver) 
-
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding
If you are not sure regarding any of the information provided above, please contact your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking XELJANZ:
-
if you think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as fever, sweating, 
chills, muscle aches, cough, shortness of breath, new phlegm or change in phlegm, weight loss, 
warm or red or painful skin or sores on your body, difficulty or pain when swallowing, 
diarrhoea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal, 
feeling very tired
-
if you have any condition that increases your chance of infection (e.g., diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or a 
weak immune system)
-
if you have any kind of infection, are being treated for any infection, or if you have infections 
that keep coming back. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. XELJANZ can reduce 
your body s ability to respond to infections and may make an existing infection worse or 
increase the chance of getting a new infection
-
if you have or have a history of tuberculosis or have been in close contact with someone with 
tuberculosis. Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before starting XELJANZ and may 
retest during treatment
-
if you have any chronic lung disease
-
if you have liver problems
-
if you have or had hepatitis B or hepatitis C (viruses that affect the liver). The virus may 
become active while you are taking XELJANZ. Your doctor may do blood tests for hepatitis 
before you start treatment with XELJANZ and while you are taking XELJANZ
-
if you are 65 years of age and older, if you have ever had any type of cancer, and also if you are 
a current or past smoker. XELJANZ may increase your risk of certain cancers. White blood cell 
cancer, lung cancer and other cancers (such as breast, skin, prostate and pancreatic) have been 
reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. If you develop cancer while taking XELJANZ your 
doctor will review whether to stop XELJANZ treatment.
-
if you are at known risk of fractures, e.g., if you are 65 years of age and older, you are a female,
or take corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone).
-
Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking XELJANZ. Your 
doctor may recommend that you have regular skin examinations while taking XELJANZ. If 
new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell 
your doctor. 
-
if you have had diverticulitis (a type of inflammation of the large intestine) or ulcers in stomach 
or intestines (see section 4)
-
if you have kidney problems
-
if you are planning to get vaccinated, tell your doctor. Certain types of vaccines should not be 
given when taking XELJANZ. Before you start XELJANZ, you should be up to date with all 
recommended vaccinations. Your doctor will decide whether you need to have herpes zoster 
vaccination. 
-
if you have heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and also if you are a current 
or past smoker
There have been reports of patients treated with XELJANZ who have developed blood clots in the 
lungs or veins. Your doctor will evaluate your risk to develop blood clots in the lungs or veins and 
determine if XELJANZ is appropriate for you. If you have already had problems on developing blood 
clots in lungs and veins or have an increased risk for developing this (for example: if you are seriously 
overweight, if you have cancer, heart problems, diabetes, experienced a heart attack (within previous 3 
months), recent major surgery, if you use hormonal contraceptives\hormonal replacement therapy, if a 
coagulation defect is identified in you or your close relatives), if you are of older age, or if you smoke
currently or in the past, your doctor may decide that XELJANZ is not suitable for you.
Talk to your doctor straight away if you develop sudden shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
chest pain or pain in upper back, swelling of the leg or arm, leg pain or tenderness, or redness or 
discoloration in the leg or arm while taking XELJANZ, as these may be signs of a clot in the lungs or 
veins.
Talk to your doctor straight away if you experience acute changes to your eyesight (blurry vision, 
partial or complete loss of vision), as this may be a sign of blood clots in the eyes.
There have been reports of patients treated with XELJANZ who have had a heart problem, including 
heart attack. Your doctor will evaluate your risk to develop a heart problem and determine if 
XELJANZ is appropriate for you. Talk to your doctor straight away if you develop signs and 
symptoms of a heart attack including severe chest pain or tightness (that may spread to arms, jaw, 
neck, back), shortness of breath, cold sweat, light headedness or sudden dizziness.
Additional monitoring tests
Your doctor should perform blood tests before you start taking XELJANZ, and after 4 to 8 weeks of 
treatment and then every 3 months, to determine if you have a low white blood cell (neutrophil or 
lymphocyte) count, or a low red blood cell count (anaemia). 
You should not receive XELJANZ if your white blood cell (neutrophil or lymphocyte) count or red 
blood cell count is too low. If needed, your doctor may interrupt your XELJANZ treatment to reduce 
the risk of infection (white blood cell counts) or anaemia (red blood cell counts).
Your doctor may also perform other tests, for example to check your blood cholesterol levels or 
monitor the health of your liver. Your doctor should test your cholesterol levels 8 weeks after you start 
receiving XELJANZ. Your doctor should perform liver tests periodically.
Elderly
There is a higher rate of infections, some of which may be serious, in patients 65 years of age and 
older. Tell your doctor as soon as you notice any signs or symptoms of infections.
Patients 65 years of age and older may be at increased risk of infections, heart attack and some types 
of cancer. Your doctor may decide that XELJANZ is not suitable for you.
Asian patients
There is a higher rate of shingles in Japanese and Korean patients. Tell your doctor if you notice any 
painful blisters on your skin. 
You may also be at higher risk of certain lung problems. Tell your doctor if you notice any breathing 
difficulties.
Children and adolescents
The safety and benefits of XELJANZ in children have not yet been established in patients less than 
2 years of age.
Other medicines and XELJANZ
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Tell your doctor if you have diabetes or are taking medicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide 
if you need less anti-diabetic medicine while taking tofacitinib.
Some medicines should not be taken with XELJANZ. If taken with XELJANZ, they could alter the 
level of XELJANZ in your body, and the dose of XELJANZ may require adjustment. You should tell 
your doctor if you are using medicines that contain any of the following active substances:</p>
<p>antibiotics such as rifampicin, used to treat bacterial infections</p>
<p>fluconazole, ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections
XELJANZ is not recommended for use with medicines that depress the immune system, including 
so-called targeted biologic (antibody) therapies, such as those that inhibit tumour necrosis factor, 
interleukin-17, interleukin-12/interleukin-23, anti-integrins, and strong chemical immunosuppressants 
including azathioprine, mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, and tacrolimus. Taking XELJANZ with these 
medicines may increase your risk of side effects including infection.
Serious infections and fractures may happen more often in people who also take corticosteroids (e.g., 
prednisone).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are a woman of childbearing age, you should use effective birth control during treatment with 
XELJANZ and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. XELJANZ must not be used during pregnancy. 
Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant while taking XELJANZ.
If you are taking XELJANZ and breast-feeding, you must stop breast-feeding until you talk to your 
doctor about stopping treatment with XELJANZ.
Driving and using machines
XELJANZ has no or limited effect on your ability to drive or use machines.
XELJANZ contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine.
XELJANZ contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""
