Xenpozyme contains an enzyme called olipudase alfa. </p>
<p>What Xenpozyme is used for 
Xenpozyme is used to treat an inherited disorder called acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). It 
is used in children and adults with ASMD types A/B or B to treat the signs and symptoms of ASMD 
not related to the brain. </p>
<p>How Xenpozyme works 
Patients with ASMD lack a properly working version of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. This 
results in build-up of a substance called sphingomyelin, which damages organs such as spleen, liver, 
heart, lungs and blood. Olipudase alfa acts in the same way as the natural enzyme would, and so acts 
as a replacement, reducing the build-up of sphingomyelin in the organs and treating the signs and 
symptoms. </p>         </div>"""

- If you have experienced life-threatening allergic (anaphylactic) reactions to olipudase alfa (see 
section ‘Warnings and precautions’ below) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
You may have side effects called infusion-associated reactions (IARs) that may be caused by the 
infusion (drip) of the medicine. They may occur while you are being given Xenpozyme or within 
24 hours after the infusion. </p>
<p>They may include allergic reactions (see section 4) and symptoms such as headache, a raised, itchy 
rash (hives), fever, nausea, vomiting and itchy skin. </p>
<p>If you think you are having an IAR, tell your doctor straight away. 
If you have a severe allergic reaction during your infusion your doctor will stop your infusion and 
provide appropriate medical treatment. Your doctor will make a judgement about the risks and 
benefits of giving you further doses Xenpozyme. </p>
<p>If you have a mild or moderate IAR, your doctor or nurse may temporarily stop the infusion, lower the 
infusion rate, and/or reduce the dose. </p>
<p>Your doctor may also give (or have given) you other medicines to prevent or manage allergic 
reactions. 
Your doctor will order blood tests to check how well your liver is working (by measuring levels of 
your liver enzymes) before starting the treatment, and then at regular intervals as the doses are 
adjusted (see section 3). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xenpozyme 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before using this medicine. </p>
<p>There is no experience with the use of Xenpozyme in pregnant women. Xenpozyme may be harmful 
to unborn children when taken by a woman during pregnancy. Xenpozyme should only be used during 
pregnancy if clearly necessary. Women who are able to become pregnant should use effective 
contraception during treatment and for 14 days after the last dose if Xenpozyme is discontinued. </p>
<p>It is not known whether Xenpozyme passes into human breast milk. Xenpozyme was detected in 
animal milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you 
decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Xenpozyme, considering the benefit 
of breast-feeding the baby and the benefit of Xenpozyme to the mother. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Xenpozyme may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines because you may 
experience low blood pressure (which may make you feel faint). </p>
<p>Xenpozyme contains sodium<br />
This medicine contains 0.60 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per 4 mg vial or </p>         </div>"""

who is experienced in the treatment of ASMD or other metabolic diseases. </p>
<p>The dose you receive is based on your body weight and will be given to you every two weeks. 
Treatment starts with a low dose of the medicine, which is gradually increased. 
Infusion usually lasts around 3 to 4 hours but may be shorter or longer based on your doctor’s 
judgement, and may be shorter during the period whilst your dose is being increased. </p>
<p>Adult patients 
The recommended starting dose of Xenpozyme is 0.1 mg for each kg of body weight. This is increased 
in a planned way with each subsequent dose, until the recommended dose of 3 mg for each kg of body 
weight every 2 weeks is reached. It typically takes up to 14 weeks to reach the recommended dose but 
may be longer based on your doctor’s judgement. </p>
<p>Children 
The recommended starting dose of Xenpozyme is 0.03 mg for each kg of body weight. The subsequent 
doses should be increased in a planned way up to the recommended dose of 3 mg for each kg of body 
weight every 2 weeks. It typically takes up to 16 weeks to reach the recommended dose but may be 
longer based on your doctor’s judgement. </p>
<p>Home infusion 
Your doctor may consider home infusion of Xenpozyme if you are on stable dose and tolerating your 
infusions well. This decision to move to home infusion should be made after evaluation and 
recommendation by your doctor. If you get a side effect during an infusion of Xenpozyme, the person 
giving your home infusion may stop the infusion and start appropriate medical treatment. </p>
<p>Instructions for proper use 
Xenpozyme is given by intravenous infusion (a drip into a vein). It is supplied as a powder that will be 
mixed with sterile water before it is given. </p>
<p>If you are given more Xenpozyme than you should<br />
Tell your doctor immediately, if you suspect a change from your routine infusion. </p>
<p>If you miss a Xenpozyme infusion<br />
It is important to have your infusion every 2 weeks. An infusion is considered missed if not given 
within 3 days from the scheduled infusion. Depending on the number of missed doses, your doctor 
may have to restart from a lower dose. </p>
<p>If you have missed an infusion or are unable to attend a scheduled appointment, please contact your 
doctor right away. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
