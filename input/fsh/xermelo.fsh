This medicine contains the active substance telotristat ethyl.  </p>
<p>What Xermelo is used for 
This medicine is used in adults with a condition called  carcinoid syndrome . This is when a tumour, 
called a  neuroendocrine tumour , releases a substance called serotonin into your bloodstream.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will prescribe this medicine if your diarrhoea is not well controlled with injections of 
other medicines called  somatostatin analogues  (lanreotide or octreotide). You should keep having 
injections of these other medicines when taking Xermelo. </p>
<p>How Xermelo works 
When the tumour releases too much serotonin into your bloodstream you can get diarrhoea.<br />
This medicine works by reducing the amount of serotonin made by the tumour. It will reduce your 
diarrhoea.  </p>         </div>"""
