<p>XGEVA is used in adults with advanced cancer to prevent serious complications caused by bone 
metastasis (e.g. fracture, pressure on the spinal cord or the need to receive radiation therapy or 
surgery). </p>

<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to denosumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your healthcare professional will not administer XGEVA to you if you have a very low level of 
calcium in your blood which has not been treated. </p>
<p>Your healthcare professional will not administer XGEVA to you if you have unhealed wounds from 
dental or oral surgery. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using XGEVA. </p>
<p>Calcium and vitamin D supplementation 
You should take calcium and vitamin D supplements while being treated with XGEVA unless your 
blood calcium is high. Your doctor will discuss this with you. If the level of calcium in your blood is 
low, your doctor may decide to give you calcium supplements before you start treatment with 
XGEVA. </p>
<p>Low calcium levels in the blood 
Please tell your doctor immediately if you have spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, and/or 
numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth and/or seizures, confusion or loss of 
consciousness while being treated with XGEVA. You may have low levels of calcium in your blood. </p>
<p>Renal impairment 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed 
dialysis, which may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium, especially if you do not take 
calcium supplements. </p>
<p>Problems with your mouth, teeth or jaw 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported commonly 
(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in patients receiving XGEVA injections for cancer-related 
conditions. Osteonecrosis of the jaw can also occur after stopping treatment. </p>
<p>It is important to try to prevent osteonecrosis of the jaw developing as it may be a painful condition 
that can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there 
are some precautions you should take: </p>
<ul>
<li>Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (healthcare professional) if you have any 
problems with your mouth or teeth. Your doctor should delay the start of your treatment if you 
have unhealed wounds in your mouth from dental procedures or oral surgery. Your doctor may 
recommend a dental examination before you start treatment with XGEVA. </li>
<li>While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental 
check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. </li>
<li>If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform 
your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with 
XGEVA. </li>
<li>Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth 
or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could 
be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. </li>
</ul>
<p>Patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, taking steroids or anti-angiogenic medicines 
(used to treat cancer), undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, have gum 
disease or who are smokers, may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
<p>Unusual thigh bone fractures 
Some people have developed unusual fractures in their thigh bone while being treated with XGEVA. 
Contact your doctor if you experience new or unusual pain in your hip, groin, or thigh. </p>
<p>High calcium levels in the blood after stopping treatment with XGEVA 
Some patients with giant cell tumour of the bone have developed high calcium levels in the blood 
weeks to months after stopping treatment. Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of 
high levels of calcium, after you stop receiving XGEVA. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<p>XGEVA is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age except for 
adolescents with giant cell tumour of the bone whose bones have stopped growing. The use of 
XGEVA has not been studied in children and adolescents with other cancers that have spread to bone. </p>
<p>Other medicines and XGEVA </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. It is especially important that you 
tell your doctor if you are being treated with 
* another medicine containing denosumab 
* a bisphosphonate </p>
<p>You should not take XGEVA together with other medicines containing denosumab or 
bisphosphonates. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>XGEVA has not been tested in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant, or plan to get pregnant. XGEVA is not recommended for use if you are 
pregnant. Women of child-bearing potential should use effective methods of contraception while being 
treated with XGEVA and for at least 5 months after stopping treatment with XGEVA. </p>
<p>If you become pregnant during treatment with XGEVA or less than 5 months after stopping treatment 
with XGEVA, please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>It is not known whether XGEVA is excreted in breast milk. It is important to tell your doctor if you 
are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop 
breast-feeding or whether to stop taking XGEVA, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby 
and the benefit of XGEVA to the mother. </p>
<p>If you are nursing during treatment with XGEVA, please inform your doctor. </p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>XGEVA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>XGEVA contains sorbitol </p>
<p>This medicine contains 78 mg sorbitol in each vial. </p>
<p>XGEVA contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

be severe. </p>
