Ximluci is a solution which is injected into the eye. Ximluci belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab.
What Ximluci is used for
Ximluci is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment.
These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) caused by:</p>
<p>Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels. This is observed in diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, a disease caused by 
diabetes). It may also be associated with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic 
myopia (PM), angioid streaks, central serous chorioretinopathy or inflammatory CNV.</p>
<p>Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused by diabetes 
(a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of retinal veins of the 
retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)).
How Ximluci works
Ximluci specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and 
swelling in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like AMD, DME, PDR, RVO, 
PM and CNV. By binding to VEGF-A, Ximluci can block its actions and prevent this abnormal 
growth and swelling.
In these diseases, Ximluci can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision.</p>         </div>"""

section 6).</p>
<p>If you have an infection in or around your eye.</p>
<p>If you have pain or redness (severe intraocular inflammation) in your eye.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before you are given Ximluci.</p>
<p>Ximluci is given as an injection into the eye. Occasionally, an infection in the internal portion of 
the eye, pain or redness (inflammation), detachment or tear of one of the layers in the back of 
the eye (retinal detachment or tear and retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), or 
clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur after Ximluci treatment. It is important to identify and 
treat such an infection or retinal detachment as soon as possible. Please tell your doctor 
immediately if you develop signs such as eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye 
redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision or 
increased sensitivity to light.</p>
<p>In some patients the eye pressure may increase for a short period directly after the injection. 
This is something you may not notice, therefore your doctor may monitor this after each 
injection.</p>
<p>Inform your doctor if you have a prior history of eye conditions or eye treatments, or if you 
have had a stroke or experienced transient signs of stroke (weakness or paralysis of limbs or 
face, difficulty speaking or understanding). This information will be taken into account to 
evaluate if Ximluci is the appropriate treatment for you.
Please see section 4 ( Possible side effects ) for more detailed information on side effects that could 
occur during Ximluci therapy.
Children and adolescents (below 18 years of age)
The use of Ximluci in children and adolescents has not been established and is therefore not 
recommended.
Other medicines and Ximluci
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least three further months after the last injection of Ximluci.</p>
<p>There is no experience of using Ximluci in pregnant women. Ximluci should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you 
are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your 
doctor before treatment with Ximluci.</p>
<p>Ximluci is not recommended during breast-feeding because it is not known whether Ximluci 
passes into human milk. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before Ximluci treatment.
Driving and using machines
After Ximluci treatment you may experience some temporary vision blurring. If this happens, do not 
drive or use machines until this resolves.</p>         </div>"""

will be administered by your eye doctor.
Before the injection, your doctor will wash your eye carefully to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you a local anaesthetic to reduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection.
The treatment is started with one injection of Ximluci per month. Your doctor will monitor the 
condition of your eye and, depending on how you respond to the treatment, will decide if and when 
you need to receive further treatment.

<p>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR HEALTHCARE 
PROFESSIONALS ONLY:
Please also refer to section 3  How Ximluci is given .
How to prepare and administer Ximluci to adults
Single-use vial for intravitreal use only.
Ximluci must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections.
In wet AMD, in CNV, in PDR and in visual impairment due to DME or to macular oedema secondary 
to RVO the recommended dose for Ximluci is 0.5 mg given as a single intravitreal injection. This 
corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 mL. The interval between two doses injected into the same 
eye should be at least four weeks.
Treatment is initiated with one injection per month until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or 
there are no signs of disease activity i.e. no change in visual acuity and in other signs and symptoms of 
the disease under continued treatment. In patients with wet AMD, DME, PDR and RVO, initially, 
three or more consecutive, monthly injections may be needed.
Thereafter, monitoring and treatment intervals should be determined by the physician and should be 
based on disease activity, as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters.
If, in the physician s opinion, visual and anatomical parameters indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, Ximluci should be discontinued.
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, functional testing or imaging 
techniques (e.g. optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography).
If patients are being treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen, once maximum visual acuity is 
achieved and/or there are no signs of disease activity, the treatment intervals can be extended stepwise 
until signs of disease activity or visual impairment recur. The treatment interval should be extended by 
no more than two weeks at a time for wet AMD and may be extended by up to one month at a time for 
DME. For PDR and RVO, treatment intervals may also be gradually extended, however there are 
insufficient data to conclude on the length of these intervals. If disease activity recurs, the treatment 
interval should be shortened accordingly.
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient based 
on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 12 months; others may 
need more frequent treatment, including a monthly injection. For CNV secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM), many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year.
Ximluci and laser photocoagulation in DME and macular oedema secondary to BRVO
There is some experience of Ximluci administered concomitantly with laser photocoagulation. When 
given on the same day, Ximluci should be administered at least 30 minutes after laser 
photocoagulation. Ximluci can be administered in patients who have received previous laser 
photocoagulation.
Ximluci and verteporfin photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM
There is no experience of concomitant administration of Ximluci and verteporfin.
Ximluci should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.
The injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) 
and the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). The patient s medical history for 
hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to performing the intravitreal procedure. 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection, in accordance with local practice.
Vial-only pack
The vial is for single use only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Any vial 
showing signs of damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the 
packaging seal remains intact.
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed:</p>
<p>a sterile 5  m filter needle (18G x 1 , 1.2 mm x 40 mm)</p>
<p>a 1 mL sterile syringe (including a 0.05 mL mark)</p>
<p>an injection needle (30G x  , 0.3 mm x 13 mm).
These medical devices are not included within the Ximluci pack.
Vial + filter needle pack
All components are sterile and for single use only. Any component with packaging showing signs of 
damage or tampering must not be used. The sterility cannot be guaranteed unless the component 
packaging seal remains intact. Re-use may lead to infection or other illness/injury.
For preparation and intravitreal injection the following medical devices for single use are needed:</p>
<p>a sterile 5  m filter needle (18G x 1 , 1.2 mm x 40 mm, provided)</p>
<p>a 1 mL sterile syringe (including a 0.05 mL mark, not included within the Ximluci pack)</p>
<p>an injection needle (30G x  , 0.3 mm x 13 mm; not included within the Ximluci pack)
To prepare Ximluci for intravitreal administration to adult patients, please adhere to the following 
instructions:
1. Before withdrawal, remove the vial cap and clean the vial 
septum (e.g. with 70% alcohol swab).
2. Assemble a 5  m filter needle (18G x 1 , 1.2 mm x 
40 mm) onto a 1 mL syringe using aseptic technique. Push 
the blunt filter needle into the centre of the vial stopper until 
the needle touches the bottom edge of the vial.
3. Withdraw all the liquid from the vial, keeping the vial in an 
upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete 
withdrawal.
4. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when 
emptying the vial in order to completely emptythe filter
needle.
5. Leave the blunt filter needle in the vial and disconnect the 
syringe from the blunt filter needle. The filter needle should 
be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and should 
not be used for the intravitreal injection.
6. Aseptically and firmly assemble 
an injection needle (30G x  , 
0.3 mm x 13 mm) onto the 
syringe.
7. Carefully remove the cap from 
the injection needle without 
disconnecting the injection 
needle from the syringe.
Note: Grip at the hub of the 
injection needle while removing 
the cap.
8. Carefully expel the air along with the excess solution from 
the syringe and adjust the dose to the 0.05 mL mark on the 
syringe. The syringe is ready for injection.
Note: Do not wipe the injection needle. Do not pull back on 
the plunger.
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5 4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05 mL is then delivered; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections.
After injection, do not recap the needle or detach it from the syringe. Dispose of the used syringe 
together with the needle in a sharps disposal container or in accordance with local requirements.</p>         </div>"""
