<p>Xofigo is used to treat adults with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer in progression after at least 
two other cancer treatments apart from treatments to maintain reduced levels of male hormone (hormone 
therapy), or who cannot take any other cancer treatment. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a cancer of 
the prostate (a gland of the male reproductive system) that does not respond to treatment that reduces male 
hormones. Xofigo is only used when the disease has spread to the bone but is not known to have spread to 
other internal organs, and is causing symptoms (e.g., pain). </p>
<p>Xofigo contains the radioactive substance radium-223 which mimics the calcium found in bones. When 
injected into the patient, radium-223 reaches the bone where the cancer has spread to and emits short-range 
radiation (alpha particles) which kills the surrounding tumour cells. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Xofigo must not be given 
* in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone (which are used together to treat prostate 
cancer). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Xofigo 
- Xofigo must not be given in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone due to a possible 
increase in the risk of bone fracture or death. Additionally, there are uncertainties about the effects of 
Xofigo in combination with other medicines used to treat metastatic prostate cancer. If you are already 
taking one of those medicines, please tell your doctor.<br />
- If you plan to take Xofigo following treatment with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone, you must 
wait 5 days before starting treatment with Xofigo. 
- If you plan to take other cancer therapy following treatment with Xofigo, you must wait at least 30 days 
before starting treatment. 
- Xofigo is not recommended if cancer in your bones is not causing symptoms, such as pain.<br />
- Xofigo can lead to a decrease in the number of your blood cells and blood platelets. Before starting 
treatment and before each subsequent dose your doctor will perform blood tests. Depending on the 
results of these tests your doctor will decide if treatment can be started, can be continued, or needs to be 
postponed or discontinued.<br />
- If you suffer from decreased blood cell production in the bone marrow, e.g., if you have received 
prior chemotherapy (other medicines used to kill cancer cells) and/or radiation therapy, you may be at 
higher risk and your doctor will give you Xofigo with caution. 
- If your tumour has spread to the bone extensively, you may also be more likely to have decreases in your 
blood cells and platelets, so your doctor will give you Xofigo with caution. 
- The limited data available do not suggest any major differences in the blood cell production of patients 
receiving chemotherapy after treatment with Xofigo compared with those who did not receive Xofigo. 
- There are no data on the use of Xofigo in patients with Crohn’s disease (a long-term inflammatory 
disease of the intestines) and with ulcerative colitis (a long-term inflammation of the colon). As Xofigo 
is excreted in the faeces, it may make acute inflammation of your bowels worse. Therefore, if you suffer 
from these conditions your doctor will carefully consider if you can be treated with Xofigo. 
- If you suffer from untreated spinal cord compression or if it is thought likely that you are developing 
spinal cord compression (pressure on the spinal cord nerves which can be caused by a tumour or other 
lesion), your doctor will first treat this disease with standard treatment before starting or continuing 
treatment with Xofigo. 
- If you have osteoporosis or a known increased risk for fractures (e.g., recent bone fracture, fragility), 
or take or have been taking steroids (e.g., prednisone/prednisolone), please tell your doctor. You might 
be at a higher risk of bone fractures. Your doctor might prescribe you a medicine to prevent bone 
fractures before starting or continuing treatment with Xofigo. 
- If you experience any new or unusual pain or swelling in bone region prior, during or after your 
treatment with Xofigo, you should consult your doctor. 
- If you experience a bone fracture, your doctor will first stabilise the fractured bone before starting or 
continuing treatment with Xofigo. 
- If you take or have taken bisphosphonates or have received chemotherapy prior to treatment with 
Xofigo, please tell your doctor. A risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (dead tissue in the jawbone which is 
mainly seen in patients who have been treated with bisphosphonates) cannot be excluded (see section 4). 
- Xofigo contributes to your overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative 
radiation exposure may increase your risk for developing cancer (in particular of bone cancer and 
leukaemia) and hereditary abnormalities. No cases of cancer caused by Xofigo have been reported in 
clinical studies with a follow-up of up to three years. </p>
<p>Your doctor will test your bone health before deciding whether you can be given Xofigo. During treatment 
and for 2 years after starting treatment with Xofigo, your doctor will continuously monitor your bone health. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xofigo 
No interaction studies with other medicines have been done. </p>
<p>Xofigo must not be given in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone due to a possible 
increase in the risk of bone fracture or death. Additionally, there are uncertainties about the effects of Xofigo 
in combination with other systemic medicines used to treat metastatic prostate cancer. If you are already 
taking one of those medicines, please tell your doctor. </p>
<p>If you take or have taken bisphosphonates or other medicines to protect your bone health or steroids (e.g., 
prednisone/prednisolone) prior to treatment with Xofigo, please tell your doctor. You might be at a higher 
risk for bone fractures. </p>
<p>If you are taking calcium, phosphate and/or Vitamin D, your doctor will carefully consider if you need to 
temporarily stop taking these substances before you start treatment with Xofigo. </p>
<p>There are no data on the use of Xofigo at the same time as chemotherapy (other medicines used to kill 
cancer cells). Xofigo and chemotherapy used together may further decrease the number of your blood cells 
and blood platelets. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Xofigo is not for use in women and must not be given to women who are, or may be, pregnant or who are 
breast-feeding. </p>
<p>Contraception in males and females 
If you are engaged in sexual activity with a woman who could become pregnant you are advised to use 
effective birth control methods during and up to 6 months after treatment with Xofigo. </p>
<p>Fertility 
There is a potential risk that radiation from Xofigo could affect your fertility. Please ask your doctor how this 
may affect you, especially if you are planning to have children in the future. You may wish to seek advice on 
conservation of sperm before treatment starts. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that Xofigo will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. </p>
<p>Xofigo contains sodium 
Depending on the volume administered, this medicine can contain up to 54 mg sodium (main component of 
cooking/table salt) per dose. This is equivalent to 2.7% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake 
of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of medicines like Xofigo. It will only be used in 
special controlled areas. This radiopharmaceutical will only be handled and given to you by people who are 
trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe use of this 
radiopharmaceutical and will keep you informed of their actions. </p>
<p>The dose you receive depends on your body weight. The doctor supervising the procedure will calculate the 
quantity of Xofigo to be used in your case. 
The recommended dose of Xofigo is 55 kBq (Becquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity) per kilogram 
body weight. 
No dose adjustment is necessary if you are 65 years of age or older or if you have reduced kidney or liver 
function. </p>
<p>Administration of Xofigo and conduct of the procedure 
Xofigo will be injected slowly via a needle into one of your veins (intravenously). The healthcare 
professional will flush the intravenous access line or cannula before and after injection with a sodium 
chloride solution. </p>
<p>Duration of the procedure 
- Xofigo is given once every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. 
- There are no data available on the safety and efficacy of treatment with more than 6 injections of 
Xofigo. </p>
<p>After administration of Xofigo 
- Care should be taken when handling materials, such as bed linen, that come into contact with body 
fluids (such as spill of urine, faeces, vomiting etc.). Xofigo is excreted mainly via the faeces. The doctor 
will tell you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving this medicine. Contact your 
doctor if you have any questions. </p>
<p>If you have been given more Xofigo than you should 
An overdose is unlikely. 
However, in the case of an accidental overdose, your doctor will start appropriate supportive treatment and 
will check you for changes in the number of blood cells, and for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, 
nausea [feeling sick], vomiting). </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of Xofigo, please ask the doctor who supervises the procedure. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. </p>
<p>The most serious side effects in patients receiving Xofigo are 
- decrease in the number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), 
- decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells (neutropenia, which may lead to 
an increased risk of infection). </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately if you notice the following symptoms as they may be signs of 
thrombocytopenia or neutropenia (see above): 
- any unusual bruising, 
- more bleeding than usual after injury, 
- fever, 
- or if you seem to be catching a lot of infections. </p>
<p>Your doctor will perform blood tests before starting treatment and before each injection to check your 
number of blood cells and platelets (see also section 2). </p>
<p>The most frequent side effects in patients receiving Xofigo (very common [may affect more than 
1 in 10 people]) are: 
- diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, thrombocytopenia (decrease in the number of blood 
platelets) and bone fracture. </p>
<p>Risk of dehydration: tell your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: dizziness, increased thirst, 
decreased urination or dry skin as these can all be symptoms of dehydration. It is important to avoid 
dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. </p>
<p>Other possible side effects are listed below by how likely they are: </p>
<p>Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
- decrease in the number of white blood cells (leukopenia) 
- decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells (neutropenia, which may lead to an 
increased risk of infection) 
- decrease in the number of red and white blood cells and blood platelets (pancytopenia) 
- injection site reactions (e.g. redness of the skin [erythema], pain and swelling) </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
- decrease in the number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells (lymphopenia) 
- weakened bones (osteoporosis) </p>
<p>Xofigo contributes to your overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation 
exposure may increase your risk of developing cancer (in particular of bone cancer and leukaemia) and 
hereditary abnormalities. No cases of cancer caused by Xofigo have been reported in clinical studies with a 
follow-up of up to three years. </p>
<p>If you have symptoms of pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a “heavy jaw feeling” or loosening of a 
tooth, please contact your doctor. Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (dead tissue in the jawbone which is 
mainly seen in patients who have been treated with bisphosphonates) have occurred in patients treated with 
Xofigo. All these cases were only seen in patients receiving bisphosphonates prior to or at the same time of 
treatment with Xofigo and chemotherapy prior to treatment with Xofigo. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 
You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting 
side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
