Xospata belongs to a class of cancer medicines called protein kinase inihibitors. It contains the active 
substance gilteritinib.  </p>
<p>What Xospata is used for 
Xospata is used to treat adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a cancer of certain white blood 
cells. Xospata is used if AML is linked to an alteration of a gene called FLT3, and is given to patients 
whose disease has come back or has not improved after previous treatment.  </p>
<p>How Xospata works<br />
In AML, patients develop large numbers of abnormal white blood cells. Gilteritinib blocks the action 
of certain enzymes (kinases) needed for the abnormal cells to multiply and grow, thus preventing the 
growth of the cancer. </p>         </div>"""

Talk to you doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have any of the following symptoms: fever, trouble breathing, rash, dizziness or 
lightheadedness, rapid weight gain, swelling of your arms or legs. These may be signs of a 
condition called differentiation syndrome (see section 4   Possible side effects). Differentiation 
syndrome can happen any time during the first 3 months of Xospata treatment from as early as 1 
day after starting treatment. If it occurs, your doctor will monitor you and may give you a 
medicine to treat your condition. She or he may also pause Xospata treatment until symptoms 
are reduced. You will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card that is included in the 
packaging. It is important that you keep this Alert Card with you and show it to any healthcare

confusion, blurred vision or other problems with seeing. These may be signs of a condition 
called PRES (see section 4.   Possible side effects). Your doctor may do a test to check if you 
have developed PRES and will stop Xospata treatment if it is confirmed that you have PRES. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xospata:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or a condition called QT
