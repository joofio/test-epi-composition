  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Xromi contains hydroxycarbamide, a substance which reduces the growth and multiplication of some 
cells in the bone marrow. These effects lead to a reduction of circulating red, white and coagulation 
blood cells. In Sickle Cell Disease, hydroxycarbamide also helps to prevent red blood cells from 
taking the abnormal sickle shape. 
Sickle Cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects the disc shaped red cells of the blood. 
Some cells become abnormal, rigid and take a crescent or sickle shape which leads to anaemia. 
The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. This can cause acute pain crises 
and organ damage. </p>
<p>Xromi is used to prevent the complications of blocked blood vessels caused by Sickle Cell Disease in 
patients over 2 years of age. Xromi will decrease the number of painful crises as well as the need for 
hospitalisation as a result of the disease. </p>         </div>"""

<li>if you are allergic to hydroxycarbamide or any of the other ingredients of Xromi (listed in 
section 6). </li>
<li>if you suffer from severe liver disease </li>
<li>if you suffer from severe kidney disease </li>
<li>if you have decreased production of red, white, or coagulating blood cells (‘myelosuppressed’) 
as described in section 3 “How to take Xromi, Treatment follow-up” </li>

</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions  </p>
<p>Test and checks </p>
<p>Your doctor will run blood tests:

- to monitor your liver before and during treatment with Xromi 
- to monitor your kidneys before and during treatment with Xromi </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xromi </p>

<li>if you have extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a 
lack of red blood cells (anaemia). </li>
<li>if you have bleeding or bruise easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood 
known as platelets. </li>
<li>if you have a liver disease (additional monitoring may be needed) </li>
<li>if you have a kidney disease (the dose may be adjusted) </li>
<li>if you have leg ulcers </li>

<p>If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Xromi. </p>
<p>Skin cancer has been reported in patients receiving long term hydroxycarbamide. You should protect 
your skin from the sun and regularly inspect your skin yourself during the treatment and after 
discontinuation of the therapy with hydroxycarbamide. Your doctor will also inspect your skin during 
routine follow-up visits. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children from birth to 2 years of age because it is unlikely to be safe. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xromi </p>

medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>other myelosuppressive medicines (those that decrease production of red, white, or coagulating 
blood cells) </li>
<li>radiation therapy or chemotherapy </li>
<li>any medicines for cancer treatment, especially interferon therapy - when used with Xromi there 
is a greater chance of side effects, such as anaemia </li>
<li>antiretroviral medicines (those that inhibit or destroy a retrovirus such as HIV), e.g. didanosine, 
stavudine, and indinavir (a drop in your white cell count may occur) </li>
<li>live vaccines, e.g. measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), chicken pox </li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>

<p>Xromi must not be used during pregnancy. Xromi should be stopped 3 to 6 months prior to becoming 
pregnant, if possible. </p>
<p>Please contact your doctor immediately if you think you may be pregnant. </p>
<p>The use of effective contraception is strongly recommended for both male and female patients. </p>
<p>For male patients taking Xromi, if your partner becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant, your 
doctor will discuss with you the potential benefits and risks of continuing using Xromi. </p>
<p>Hydroxycarbamide, the active substance of Xromi, passes into human breast milk. Do not breastfeed 
while taking Xromi. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Xromi can make you feel drowsy. You should not drive or operate any machinery unless it has been 
shown not to affect you and you have discussed it with your doctor. </p>

<p>Xromi should only be given to you by a specialist doctor who is experienced in treating blood

<ul>
<li>When you take Xromi your doctor will take regular blood tests. This is to check the number and 
type of cells in your blood and to check your liver and kidney. </li>
<li>Depending on the dose you take, these tests may be performed initially once a month and then 
every 2-3 months. </li>
<li>Depending on these results your doctor may change your dose of Xromi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual starting dose for adults, 
adolescents and children over the age of 2 years is 15 mg/kg each day and the usual maintenance dose 
is between 20-25 mg/kg. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. Sometimes the doctor 
may change your dose of Xromi, for example as a result of different tests. If you are not sure how 
much medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>Xromi with food and drink 
You can take this medicine with or after meals at any time of the day. However, the choice of method 
and time of day should be consistent from day to day. </p>
<p>Use in elderly 
You may be more sensitive to the effects of Xromi and your doctor may need to give you a lower 
dose. </p>
<p>If you have kidney disease 
Your doctor may need to give you a lower dose. 
You should not take Xromi if you have severe kidney disease. </p>

Your pack of Xromi contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes (a 
3 ml and a 10 ml syringe). Always use the syringes provided to take your medicine. </p>
<p>It is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist 
will advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed. </p>
<p>The smaller 3 ml syringe, marked from 0.5 ml to 3 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or equal to 
3 ml. You should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 3 ml (each 
graduation of 0.1 ml contains 10 mg of hydroxycarbamide). 
The larger 10 ml syringe, marked from 1 ml to 10 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 3 ml.
