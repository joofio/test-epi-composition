  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Xromi contains hydroxycarbamide, a substance which reduces the growth and multiplication of some 
cells in the bone marrow. These effects lead to a reduction of circulating red, white and coagulation 
blood cells. In Sickle Cell Disease, hydroxycarbamide also helps to prevent red blood cells from 
taking the abnormal sickle shape. 
Sickle Cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects the disc shaped red cells of the blood. 
Some cells become abnormal, rigid and take a crescent or sickle shape which leads to anaemia. 
The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. This can cause acute pain crises 
and organ damage. </p>
<p>Xromi is used to prevent the complications of blocked blood vessels caused by Sickle Cell Disease in 
patients over 2 years of age. Xromi will decrease the number of painful crises as well as the need for 
hospitalisation as a result of the disease. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Skin cancer has been reported in patients receiving long term hydroxycarbamide. You should protect 
your skin from the sun and regularly inspect your skin yourself during the treatment and after 
discontinuation of the therapy with hydroxycarbamide. Your doctor will also inspect your skin during 
routine follow-up visits. </p>
<p>Children </p>

medicines. </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>other myelosuppressive medicines (those that decrease production of red, white, or coagulating 
blood cells) </li>
<li>radiation therapy or chemotherapy </li>
<li>any medicines for cancer treatment, especially interferon therapy - when used with Xromi there 
is a greater chance of side effects, such as anaemia </li>

stavudine, and indinavir (a drop in your white cell count may occur) </li>

pregnant, if possible. </p>
<p>Please contact your doctor immediately if you think you may be pregnant. 
The use of effective contraception is strongly recommended for both male and female patients. </p>
<p>For male patients taking Xromi, if your partner becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant, your 
doctor will discuss with you the potential benefits and risks of continuing using Xromi. </p>
<p>Hydroxycarbamide, the active substance of Xromi, passes into human breast milk. Do not breastfeed 
while taking Xromi. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. </p>

or pharmacist if you are not sure. </p>
<p>Xromi should only be given to you by a specialist doctor who is experienced in treating blood 
problems. </p>
<ul>
<li>When you take Xromi your doctor will take regular blood tests. This is to check the number and 
type of cells in your blood and to check your liver and kidney. </li>
<li>Depending on the dose you take, these tests may be performed initially once a month and then 
every 2-3 months. </li>
<li>Depending on these results your doctor may change your dose of Xromi. </li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual starting dose for adults, 
adolescents and children over the age of 2 years is 15 mg/kg each day and the usual maintenance dose 
is between 20-25 mg/kg. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. Sometimes the doctor 
may change your dose of Xromi, for example as a result of different tests. If you are not sure how 
much medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. </p>
<p>Xromi with food and drink 
You can take this medicine with or after meals at any time of the day. However, the choice of method 
and time of day should be consistent from day to day. </p>
<p>Use in elderly 
You may be more sensitive to the effects of Xromi and your doctor may need to give you a lower 
dose. </p>
<p>If you have kidney disease 
Your doctor may need to give you a lower dose. 
You should not take Xromi if you have severe kidney disease. </p>
<p>Handling 
Your pack of Xromi contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes (a 
3 ml and a 10 ml syringe). Always use the syringes provided to take your medicine. </p>
<p>It is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist 
will advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed. </p>
<p>The smaller 3 ml syringe, marked from 0.5 ml to 3 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or equal to 
3 ml. You should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 3 ml (each 
graduation of 0.1 ml contains 10 mg of hydroxycarbamide). 
The larger 10 ml syringe, marked from 1 ml to 10 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 3 ml. 
You should use this one if the total amount you have to take is more than 3 ml (each graduation of 
0.5 ml contains 50 mg of hydroxycarbamide). </p>
<p>If you are a parent or care giver administering the medicine, wash your hands before and after 
administering a dose. Wipe up spillages immediately. To decrease the risk of exposure disposable 
gloves should be used when handling Xromi. To minimise air bubbles, do not shake the bottle before 
administering a dose. </p>
<p>If Xromi comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly 
with soap and water. </p>
<p>When you use the medicine follow the instructions below: </p>
<ol>
<li>Put on disposable hand gloves before handling Xromi. </li>
<li>Remove the bottle cap (figure 1) and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle and leave 
in place for future doses (figure 2). </li>
<li>Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor (figure 3). Your doctor or 
pharmacist will advise you of the correct syringe to use, either the 3 ml or the 10 ml 
syringe in order to give the correct dose. </li>
<li>Turn the bottle upside down (figure 4). </li>
<li>Pull the plunger of the syringe back so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the 
syringe. Pull the plunger back to the point on the scale that corresponds to the dose prescribed 
(figure 4). If you are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the syringe, always ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice. </li>
<li>Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, 
holding it by the barrel rather than the plunger. </li>
<li>Gently put the tip of the syringe into your mouth and to the inside of your cheek. </li>
<li>Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of your 
cheek and swallow it. DO NOT forcefully push down the plunger, or squirt the medicine to the 
back of your mouth or throat, as you may choke. </li>
<li>Remove the syringe from your mouth. </li>
<li>Swallow the dose of oral solution then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in 
your mouth. </li>
<li>Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place. Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. </li>
<li>Wash the syringe with cold or warm tap water and rinse well. Hold the syringe under water and 
move the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the syringe is clean. Let 
the syringe dry completely before you use that syringe again for dosing. Store the syringe in a 
hygienic place with the medicine. </li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat the above for each dose as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you take more Xromi than you should </p>
<p>If you take more Xromi than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital immediately. Take the 
medicine pack and this leaflet with you. The most common symptoms of overdose with Xromi are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redness of the skin, </li>
<li>Soreness (touch is painful) and swelling of the palms of hands and soles of feet followed by the 
hands and feet becoming scaly, </li>
<li>Skin becoming strongly pigmented (locally changes of colour), </li>
<li>Soreness or swelling in the mouth. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you forget to take Xromi </p>
<p>Tell your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Xromi </p>
<p>Do not stop taking your medicine unless advised by your doctor. If you have any further questions on 
the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
