  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>What Xultophy is used for 
Xultophy is used to improve blood glucose (sugar) levels in adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. You have diabetes because your body: 
* does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in your blood or 
* is not able to use the insulin properly. </p>
<p>How Xultophy works<br />
Xultophy contains two active substances that help your body control your blood sugar:<br />
<em> insulin degludec   a long-acting basal insulin which lowers your blood sugar levels.<br />
</em> liraglutide   a  GLP-1 analogue  that helps your body make more insulin during meals and 
lowers the amount of sugar made by your body.  </p>
<p>Xultophy and oral medicines for diabetes 
Xultophy is used with oral medicines for diabetes (such as metformin, pioglitazone and sulfonylurea 
medicines). It is prescribed when these medicines (used alone or with GLP-1 treatment or with basal 
insulin) are not enough to control your blood sugar levels.  </p>
<p>If you use GLP-1 treatment 
You should stop your GLP-1 treatment prior to starting on Xultophy. </p>
<p>If you use insulin 
You should stop your insulin treatment prior to starting on Xultophy. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Do not use Xultophy<br />
* if you are allergic to insulin degludec or liraglutide or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Xultophy.<br />
<em> If you are also taking a sulfonylurea (such as glimepiride or glibenclamide), your doctor may 
tell you to lower your sulfonylurea dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
* Do not use Xultophy if you have type 1 diabetes mellitus or if you have  ketoacidosis  (a 
condition with a build-up of acid in the blood).<br />
</em> The use of Xultophy is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or 
delayed gastric emptying (diabetic gastroparesis). </p>
<p>Be especially aware of the following when using Xultophy: 
* low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)   if your blood sugar is low, follow the advice in section 4 
 Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) . 
* high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)   if your blood sugar is high, follow the advice in section 4 
 High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) . 
* Ensuring you use the right medicine   Always check the pen label before each injection to avoid 
accidentally confusing Xultophy with other products. </p>
<p>Important things to know before you use this medicine: 
Tell your doctor if you:<br />
* have eye problems. Fast improvements in blood sugar control may make diabetic eye problems 
get worse for a short time. The long-term improvements in blood sugar control may ease the eye 
problems. 
* have or have had a thyroid disease.  </p>
<p>Important things to know while you are using this medicine: 
* if you have a severe stomach ache which does not go away, tell your doctor   this could be a 
sign of inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis).<br />
* dehydration (loss of fluids from the body) can happen if you are feeling or being sick (nausea or 
vomiting) or have diarrhoea   it is important to drink plenty of fluids to stop dehydration.  </p>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3  How to use Xultophy ). Tell your 
doctor if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently 
injecting into these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell 
you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic 
medications dose. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents. There is no experience with Xultophy in children 
and adolescents under 18 years old. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xultophy 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level   this may mean your Xultophy dose has to 
change. </p>
<p>Listed below are the most common medicines, which may affect your Xultophy treatment. </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may fall if you take: 
* other medicines for diabetes (tablets or injections) 
* sulfonamides   for infections 
* anabolic steroids   such as testosterone 
* beta-blockers   for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs 
of low blood sugar (see section 4  Warning signs of low blood sugar   these may come on 
suddenly ) 
* acetylsalicylic acid (and medicines called  salicylates )   for pain and mild fever 
* monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors   for depression 
* angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors   for some heart problems or high blood 
pressure. </p>
<p>Your blood sugar level may rise if you take: 
* danazol   medicine affecting ovulation 
* oral contraceptives   birth control pills 
* thyroid hormones   for thyroid disease 
* growth hormone   for low levels of growth hormone<br />
* medicines called  glucocorticoids  such as cortisone   for inflammation 
* medicines called  sympathomimetics  such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or 
terbutaline   for asthma 
* water tablets called  thiazides    for high blood pressure or if your body is holding onto too 
much water (water retention). </p>
<p>Octreotide and lanreotide   used for treatment of acromegaly (a rare illness with too much growth 
hormone). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. </p>
<p>Pioglitazone   tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with long-
standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke, who were treated with 
pioglitazone and insulin, experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor straight 
away if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in 
weight or localised swelling (oedema). </p>
<p>Warfarin or other blood thinners   medicines used to prevent clotting of the blood. Tell your doctor 
if you are taking warfarin or other blood thinners as you might need to have blood tests more often to 
measure how thick your blood is (called  International Normalised Ratio  or INR test). </p>
<p>Xultophy with alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for Xultophy may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
Do not use Xultophy if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are 
pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. It is not known if Xultophy 
affects the baby. </p>
<p>Do not use Xultophy if you are breast-feeding. It is not known if Xultophy passes into breast milk.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Having low or high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your 
blood sugar is low or high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be 
dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: 
* you often get low blood sugar 
* you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Xultophy<br />
Xultophy contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is 
essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How to handle Xultophy<br />
Xultophy is a pre-filled dial-a-dose pen. 
* Xultophy is administered as  dose steps . The dose counter on the pen shows the number of 
dose steps. 
* One dose step contains 1 unit of insulin degludec and 0.036 mg of liraglutide.<br />
* The maximum daily dose of Xultophy is 50 dose steps (50 units of insulin degludec and 1.8 mg 
of liraglutide). 
Carefully read the  Instructions on how to use  on the other side of this leaflet and use the pen as 
described.<br />
Always check the pen label before you inject your medicine to ensure that you use the correct pen. </p>
<p>How to inject 
Before you use Xultophy for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject. 
* Xultophy is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously). Do not inject it into a vein or 
muscle. 
* The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist 
(abdomen). 
* Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
lumps and skin pitting (see section 4). 
* Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked 
needles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. 
* Do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential 
overdose. </p>
<p>Detailed instructions for use are on the other side of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Do not use Xultophy: 
* If the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5). 
* If the liquid you can see through the pen window does not look clear and colourless. </p>
<p>Use in elderly patients (65 years old or over) 
Xultophy can be used in elderly patients but if you are elderly you may need to check your blood sugar 
level more often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. </p>
<p>If you have kidney or liver problems 
If you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose. </p>
<p>If you use more Xultophy than you should<br />
If you use more Xultophy than you should, your blood sugar may get low (hypoglycaemia) or you 
may feel or be sick (nausea or vomiting). If your blood sugar gets low, see the advice in section 4 
 Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) .  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Xultophy<br />
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of 
8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your 
next regular scheduled dose, do not take a double dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Xultophy<br />
Do not stop using Xultophy without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Xultophy this could lead 
to a very high blood sugar level, see the advice in section 4  High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) . </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. </p>         </div>"""

following serious side effects may happen with this medicine: </p>
<ul>
<li>Low blood sugar (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people).<br />
If your blood sugar level gets low you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious 
hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you have signs of low 
blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level straight away. See advice in  Low 
blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)  further down in this section.  </li>
<li>Serious allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) (not known: frequency cannot be estimated 
from the available data). </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a serious allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in Xultophy, stop using 
Xultophy and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local reactions spread to other parts of your body </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you suddenly feel unwell with sweating </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have difficulty breathing </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you get a fast heartbeat or feel dizzy. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Skin changes at the injection site: 
If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken 
(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the 
injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  </p>
<p>Other side effects include: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
* Lower appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting), diarrhoea, constipation, indigestion 
(dyspepsia), inflamed lining of the stomach (gastritis), stomach ache, heartburn or bloating <br />
these usually go away after a few days or weeks. 
* Injection site reactions. The signs may include bruising, bleeding, pain, redness, hives, swelling 
or itching   these usually go away after a few days. See your doctor if they do not disappear 
after a few weeks. Stop using Xultophy and see a doctor straight away if they become serious.<br />
* Increase of pancreatic enzymes, such as lipase and amylase. </p>
<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
* Hives (red bumps on your skin that are sometimes itchy). 
* Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) such as rash, itching and swelling of the face. 
* Dehydration (loss of fluid from the body)   it is important to drink plenty of fluids to stop 
dehydration. 
* Belching (eructation) and wind (flatulence). 
* Rash. 
* Itching. 
* Increased heart rate. 
* Gallstones. 
* Inflamed gallbladder. 
* Change in how things taste. </p>
<p>Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) 
* Inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis). 
* Swelling of arms or legs (peripheral oedema)   when you first start using your medicine, your 
body may keep more water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other 
joints. This is usually only short-lasting. </p>
<p>General effects from diabetes treatment </p>
<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) </p>
<p>Low blood sugar may happen if you: 
* drink alcohol 
* exercise more than usual 
* eat too little or miss a meal<br />
* use too much Xultophy. </p>
<p>Warning signs of low blood sugar   these may come on suddenly 
Headache, slurred speech, fast heartbeat, cold sweat, cool pale skin, feeling sick (nausea), feeling very 
hungry, shaking, feeling nervous or worried, unusually tired, weak and sleepy or confused, difficulty 
concentrating, short-lasting changes in your sight. </p>
<p>What to do if you get low blood sugar: 
* Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack   like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always 
carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). 
* Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more 
than once. This is because improvement in your blood sugar may not happen straight away. 
* Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. 
Then carry on with your medicine as usual. </p>
<p>What others need to do if you pass out:<br />
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets low, including the risk of passing out. </p>
<p>Let them know that if you pass out, they must: 
* turn you on your side 
* get medical help straight away 
* not give you any food or drink   because you may choke. </p>
<p>You may recover more quickly from passing out if you receive  glucagon. This can only be given by 
someone who knows how to use it. 
* If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. 
* If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
* If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short- or long-lasting. It may even cause death. 
Talk to your doctor if: 
* your blood sugar got so low that you passed out 
* you have used glucagon 
* you have had low blood sugar a few times recently. 
This is because the dosing of your Xultophy injections, food or exercise may need to be changed. </p>
<p>High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) </p>
<p>High blood sugar may happen if you: 
* drink alcohol 
* exercise less than usual 
* eat more than usual 
* get an infection or a fever 
* have not used enough Xultophy, keep using less Xultophy than you need, forget to use 
Xultophy or stop using Xultophy without talking to your doctor. </p>
<p>Warning signs of high blood sugar   these normally appear gradually 
Flushed, dry skin, feeling sleepy or tired, dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath, urinating more often, 
feeling thirsty, losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called  ketoacidosis . This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death. </p>
<p>What to do if you get high blood sugar: 
* Test your blood sugar level. 
* Test your blood or urine for ketones. 
* Get medical help straight away. </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the
