Xydalba is used to treat adults and children aged 3 months and over with infections of the skin or 
in the layers of flesh below the skin. 
Xydalba works by killing certain bacteria, which can cause serious infections. It kills these bacteria by 
interfering with the formation of bacterial cell walls.
If you also have other bacteria that cause your infection, your doctor may decide to treat you with 
other antibiotics in addition to Xydalba.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before being given Xydalba:</p>
<p>If you have or have had kidney problems. Depending on your age and the condition of 
your kidney, your doctor may have to reduce your dose.</p>
<p>If you are suffering from diarrhoea, or you have previously suffered from diarrhoea 
when being treated with antibiotics.</p>
<p>If you are allergic to other antibiotics such as vancomycin or teicoplanin.
Diarrhoea during or after treatment
If you develop diarrhoea during or after your treatment, tell your doctor at once. Do not take any 
medicine to treat your diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor.
Infusion-related reactions
Intravenous infusions with these types of antibiotics can cause flushing of the upper body, hives, 
itching and/or rashes. If you experience these types of reactions your doctor may decide to stop or 
slow the infusion.
Other infections
Using antibiotics may sometimes allow a new and different infection to develop. If this happens tell 
your doctor and they will decide what to do.
Children
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 months. The use of Xydalba in children under 3 months
has not been studied enough.
Other medicines and Xydalba
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Xydalba is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. This is because it is not 
known what effect it might have on an unborn baby. Before you are given this medicine, tell your 
doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. You and 
your doctor will decide if you will be given Xydalba.
It is not known if Xydalba passes into breast milk in humans. Ask your doctor for advice before 
breast-feeding your baby. You and your doctor will decide if you will be given Xydalba. You should 
not breastfeed when given Xydalba.
Driving and using machines
Xydalba may cause dizziness. Take care with driving and using machines after you have been given 
this medicine.
Xydalba contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-
free .</p>         </div>"""
