age.  </p>
<p>Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that may include attacks of sleep during normal waking hours, as well 
as cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations and poor sleep.  Cataplexy is the onset of sudden muscle

- if you are allergic to sodium oxybate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
- if you have succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (a rare metabolic disorder); 
- if you suffer from major depression; 
- if you are being treated with opioid or barbiturate medicines. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Xyrem:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have breathing or lung problems (and especially if you are obese), because Xyrem has 
the potential to cause difficulty in breathing; </li>
<li>if you have or have previously had depressive illness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, psychosis (a 
mental disorder that may involve hallucinations, incoherent speech, or disorganized and 
agitated behaviour) or bipolar disorder  </li>
<li>if you have heart failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), liver or kidney problems as your 
dose may need to be adjusted; </li>
<li>if you have previously abused drugs; </li>
<li>if you suffer from epilepsy as the use of Xyrem is not recommended in this condition; </li>
<li>if you have porphyria (an uncommon metabolic disorder). </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Xyrem. </p>
<p>While you are taking Xyrem, if you experience bed wetting and incontinence (both urine and faeces), 
confusion, hallucinations, episodes of sleepwalking or abnormal thinking you should tell your doctor 
straight away. Whilst these effects are uncommon, if they do occur they are usually mild-to-moderate 
in nature. </p>
<p>If you are elderly, your doctor will monitor your condition carefully to check whether Xyrem is 
having the desired effects. </p>
<p>Xyrem has a well-known abuse potential. Cases of dependency have occurred after the illicit use of 
sodium oxybate. </p>
<p>Your doctor will ask if you have ever abused any drugs before you start taking Xyrem and whilst you 
are using the medicine. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Xyrem can be taken by adolescents and children from 7 years of age when they are over 15 kg in 
weight. </p>
<p>Xyrem cannot be taken by children below 7 years of age or below 15 kg in weight.   </p>
<p>If you are a child or adolescent, your doctor will monitor your body weight regularly. </p>
<p>Whilst the doctor is adjusting the dose which may take a number of weeks, parent/caregivers should 
carefully monitor the child s breath during the first 2 hours after sodium oxybate intake to assess if 
there is any abnormality in breathing, for example stoppage of breathing for short periods while 
sleeping, noisy breathing and bluish colour of the lips and face. If abnormality in breathing is 
observed medical support should be sought and the doctor should be informed as soon as possible. If 
any abnormality is noted after the first dose, the second dose should not be administered. If no 
abnormality is noted the second dose can be administered. The second dose should not be given 
earlier than 2.5 hours or later than 4 hours after the first dose.  </p>
<p>If you have had or are having upsetting feelings particularly if you are feeling very sad or have lost 
interest in life it is important that you tell the doctor or caregiver. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Xyrem 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>In particular Xyrem should not be taken together with sleep inducing medicines and medicines that 
reduce central nervous system activity (the central nervous system is the part of the body related to the 
brain and spinal cord).  </p>
<p>Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following types of medicines: </p>
<p>medicines that increase central nervous system activity  </p>
<p>antidepressants </p>
<p>medicines that may be processed in a similar way by the body (e.g., valproate, phenytoin or 
ethosuximide which are used for the treatment of fits) </p>
<p>topiramate (used for treatment of epilepsy) </p>
<p>If you are taking Valproate, your daily dose of Xyrem will need to be adjusted (see section 3) as it 
may lead to interactions with Valproate </p>
<p>Xyrem with alcohol 
You must not drink alcohol while taking Xyrem, as its effects can be increased. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
There have been very few women who have taken Xyrem sometime during their pregnancy and a few 
of them had spontaneous abortions. The risk of taking Xyrem during pregnancy is unknown, and, 
therefore, the use of Xyrem in pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant is not 
recommended.  </p>
<p>Patients taking Xyrem should not breast feed since it is known that Xyrem passes into breast milk. 
Changes in sleep patterns have been observed in breastfed infants from exposed mothers. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Xyrem will affect you if you drive or operate tools or machines. Do not drive a car, operate heavy 
machinery, or perform any activity that is dangerous or that requires mental alertness for at least 6 
hours after taking Xyrem. When you first start taking Xyrem, until you know whether it makes you 
sleepy the next day, use extreme care while driving a car, operating heavy machinery or doing 
anything else that could be dangerous or needs you to be fully mentally alert.  </p>
<p>For paediatric patients, physicians, parents or caregivers are advised that the waiting time for 
performing activities that require mental alertness, motor co-ordination or any activities that may have 
a physical risk may have to be longer than 6 hours, depending on individual sensitivity.  </p>
<p>Xyrem contains sodium 
This medicine contains 182.24 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each gram. This 
is equivalent to 9.11% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you need 2 g of sodium oxybate (Xyrem) or more daily for a 
prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.  </p>         </div>"""

or pharmacist if you are not sure.   </p>
<p>It is important that you only use the syringe provided in the box when preparing doses of Xyrem. The 
Xyrem syringe has two different measurement scales, one scale may be more helpful for you than the 
other depending on which dose your doctor has prescribed. By looking at each scale you will see 
which one provides the exact mark for your dose. </p>
<p>Adults   taking Xyrem on its own<br />
  For adults the recommended starting dose is 4.5 g each day, given as two seperate doses of 
2.25 g. 
  Your doctor may gradually increase your dose up to a maximum of 9 g each day given as two 
separate doses of 4.5 g. 
  Take Xyrem orally two times each night:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the first dose upon getting into bed and the second dose  2  to 4 hours later. You 
may need to set an alarm clock to make sure you wake up to take the second dose.   </li>
<li>Food decreases the amount of Xyrem that is absorbed by your body. Therefore, it is best 
to take Xyrem at set times 2 to 3 hours after a meal.  </li>
<li>Prepare both doses before bedtime.   </li>
<li>Take doses within 24 hours after preparation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Adolescents and children aged 7 years and over who weigh 15 kg or more - taking Xyrem on its 
own<br />
For those aged 7 years and over who weigh 15 kg or more, a doctor will work out the right dose based 
on your body weight.  </p>
<p>Your doctor will work out the right dose for you. Do not exceed the dose prescribed for you. </p>
<p>Adults - taking Xyrem with Valproate<br />
If you are taking valproate together with Xyrem, the dose of Xyrem will be adapted by your doctor.  </p>
<p>For adults the recommended starting dose for Xyrem, when used together with Valproate, is 
3.6 g each day, given as two separate doses of 1.8 g.<br />
  Take the first dose when getting into bed and the second dose 2  to 4 hours later.   </p>
<p>Adolescents and children aged 7 years and older who weigh 15 kg or more - taking Xyrem with 
Valproate<br />
If you are taking Valproate together with Xyrem, the dose of Xyrem will be adapted by your doctor.  </p>
<p>Kidney or liver problems<br />
  If you have kidney problems, you should consider a dietary recommendation to reduce sodium 
(salt) intake. If you have liver problems, the starting dose should be halved. Your doctor may 
gradually increase your dose. </p>
<p>Instructions on how to dilute Xyrem </p>
<p>The following instructions explain how to prepare Xyrem. Please read the instructions carefully and 
follow them step by step. Do not allow children to prepare Xyrem.  </p>
<p>To help you, the Xyrem carton contains 1 bottle of medicine, a measuring syringe (with two different 
measurement scales) and two dosing cups with child-resistant caps. </p>
<p>Step 1  </p>
<p>Remove the bottle cap by pushing down while turning the cap 
anticlockwise (to the left).  </p>
<p>After removing the cap, set the bottle upright on a table-top.  </p>
<p>There is a plastic covered foil seal on the top of the bottle, which 
must be removed before using the bottle for the first time.  </p>
<p>While holding the bottle in its upright position, insert the press-in-
bottle-adaptor into the neck of the bottle. This needs only to be 
done the first time that the bottle is opened. The adaptor can then 
be left in the bottle for all subsequent uses </p>
<p>Step 2 </p>
<p>Next, insert the tip of the measuring syringe into the centre 
opening of the bottle and press down firmly<br />
While holding the bottle and syringe with one hand, draw up the 
prescribed dose with the other hand by pulling on the plunger.<br />
NOTE: Medicine will not flow into the syringe unless you keep 
the bottle in its upright position </p>
<p>Step 3                                                                                                                                                                                  <br />
  Remove the syringe from the centre opening of the bottle.<br />
  Empty the medicine from the syringe into one of the dosing 
cups provided by pushing on the plunger Repeat this step 
for the second dosing cup.<br />
  Then add about 60 ml of water to each dosing cup (60 mL is 
about 4 tablespoons).  </p>
<p>Step 4 
  Place the caps provided on the dosing cups and turn each cap 
clockwise (to the right) until it clicks and locks into its 
child-resistant position (Caution: as the dosing cup cap is 
reversible, only after the clicking noise is heard it is 
ensured that the cap is closed in the child-resistant 
manner). 
  Rinse out the syringe with water.  </p>
<p>Just before going to sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adult patients should place the second dose near their bed.  </li>
<li>The parent or caregiver of adolescents and children aged 7 years and over should not leave the 
second dose near the child s bed or within easy reach of the child. </li>
<li>You may need to set an alarm so you wake up to take your second dose no earlier than 2<br />
hours and no later than 4 hours after your first dose.   </li>
</ul>
<p>Then: * Remove the cap from the first dosing cup by pressing down on the child-resistant locking tab 
and turning the cap anticlockwise (to the left).   * Drink all of the first dose while sitting in bed, recap the cup, and then lie down right away. For 
children who sleep longer than 8 hours but less than 12 hours, the first dose may be given after 
the child has been sleeping for 1 to 2 hours.  </p>
<p>When you wake up or wake up the child  2   to 4 hours later, remove the cap from the second 
dosing cup. While sitting in bed, drink all of the second dose right before lying down to 
continue sleeping. Recap the second cup. </p>
<p>If you have the impression that the effect of Xyrem is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist. </p>
<p>If you take more Xyrem than you should 
Symptoms of Xyrem overdose may include agitation, confusion, impaired movement, impaired 
breathing, blurred vision, profuse sweating, headache, vomiting, decreased consciousness leading to 
coma and seizures, excessive thirst, muscle cramps and weakness. If you take more Xyrem than you 
were told to take, or take it by accident, get emergency medical help right away. You should take the 
labelled medicine bottle with you, even if it is empty. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Xyrem 
If you forget to take the first dose, take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before.  If 
you miss the second dose, skip that dose and do not take Xyrem again until the next night. Do not take 
a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If unsure if you took Xyrem 
If in doubt about administration of a dose, do not re-administer the dose to reduce the risk of overdose  </p>
<p>If you stop taking Xyrem 
You should continue to take Xyrem for as long as instructed by your doctor. You may find that your 
cataplexy attacks return if your medicine is stopped and you may experience insomnia, headache, 
anxiety, dizziness, sleeping problems, sleepiness, hallucination and abnormal thinking. 
If you stop taking Xyrem for more than 14 consecutive days, you should consult your doctor as you 
should restart taking Xyrem at a reduced dose. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
