<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to trabectedin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). </li>

<li>if you are breast-feeding. </li>
<li>if you will receive yellow fever vaccine. </li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before using Yondelis  </p>
<p>Yondelis or its combination with PLD must not be used if you have severe liver, kidney or cardiac 
damage.<br />
Tell your doctor if you know or suspect that you have any of the following before starting the 
treatment with Yondelis: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Liver or kidney problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cardiac problems or a history of cardiac problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under the lower limit of normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Received high anthracycline dose treatment in the past. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should seek medical attention immediately if any of the following conditions appear: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you develop a fever as Yondelis may cause side-effects affecting your blood and liver. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you still feel sick, vomit or are unable to drink fluids and therefore pass less urine despite 
being given anti-sickness medicines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you experience severe muscle pain or weakness as it could be a sign of damage to your 
muscles (rhabdomyolysis; see section 4). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you notice that Yondelis infusion leaks out of your vein while you are being given it. It could 
lead to damage and death of your tissue cells around the injection site (tissue necrosis, see also 
section 4) which may require surgery. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have an allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). In this case you may experience one or more 
of the following signs: fever, difficulty in breathing, redness or flushing of the skin or a rash, 
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting; see section 4). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you notice unexplained partial or general swelling (oedema), with possible lightheadedness, 
dizziness or thirst (low blood pressure). It could be a sign of a condition (capillary leak 
syndrome) that can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in your tissues, and requires urgent 
medical evaluation by your doctor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents  </p>
<p>Yondelis should not be used in children below 18 years of age with paediatric sarcomas. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Yondelis </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>You must not use Yondelis if you will receive yellow fever vaccine and it is not recommended that 
you use Yondelis if you will receive a vaccine containing live virus particles. The effect of 
medicines containing phenytoin (for epilepsy) may be decreased if given together with Yondelis and 
this is therefore not recommended.  </p>
<p>If you use any of the following medicines during your treatment with Yondelis, you need to be 
closely monitored as the effects of Yondelis are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>decreased (examples are medicines containing rifampicin (for bacterial infections), 
phenobarbital (for epilepsy) or St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, an herbal medicine for 
depression)) or  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increased (examples are medicines containing ketoconazole or fluconazole (for fungal 
infections), ritonavir (for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), clarithromycin (for 
bacterial infections), aprepitant (to prevent nausea and vomiting), ciclosporin (inhibit the 
defensive system of the body) or verapamil (for high blood pressure and heart conditions)).  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the use of any of these medicines together with Yondelis should be avoided, if possible.  </p>
<p>If you are given Yondelis or the combination Yondelis+PLD together with a medicine that might 
cause damage to the liver or to the muscles (rhabdomyolysis), you may need to be closely 
monitored, as there could be an increased risk of liver or muscle damage. Medicines containing 
statins (for lowering cholesterol levels and preventing cardiovascular disease) is an example of 
medicines that may cause muscle damage. </p>
<p>Yondelis with alcohol </p>
<p>Alcohol consumption must be avoided during treatment with Yondelis as this may harm the liver. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>Yondelis should not be used during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or 
are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.  </p>
<p>Adequate contraceptive precautions must be used by women of childbearing potential when 
receiving Yondelis and for 3 months following the end of treatment.  </p>
<p>If a pregnancy should occur you must tell your doctor immediately and genetic counselling is 
recommended since Yondelis can cause genetic damage. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding </p>
<p>Yondelis must not be given to patients who are breast-feeding. Therefore you must stop 
breast-feeding before you start your treatment and you must not begin breast-feeding again until 
your doctor has confirmed that it is safe to do so. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>Adequate contraceptive precautions must be used by men in fertile age when receiving Yondelis and 
for 5 months following the end of treatment. </p>
<p>Patients should seek advice on ovules or sperm conservation prior to treatment because of the risk 
of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Yondelis. </p>
<p>Genetic counselling is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>During your treatment with Yondelis you may feel tired and experience a loss of strength. Do not 
drive or use any tools or machines if you are experiencing any of these side effects. </p>
<p>Yondelis contains potassium </p>
<p>This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per vial, and can therefore be 
considered as essentially “potassium-free”. </p>         </div>"""

chemotherapy. Its use should be confined to qualified oncologists or other health professionals 
specialised in the administration of cytotoxic medicines. </p>
<p>For the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, the usual dose is 1.5 mg/m2 of body surface area. During 
the treatment period, your doctor will carefully monitor you and decide the most appropriate dosage 
of Yondelis to give to you. The recommended dose in Japanese patients is lower than the usual dose 
for all other races, and is 1.2 mg/m2 of body surface area. </p>
<p>For the treatment of ovarian cancer, the usual dose is 1.1 mg/m2 body surface area after the 
administration of 30 mg/m2 body surface area of PLD. </p>
<p>Before Yondelis is given to you, it is reconstituted and diluted for intravenous use. Every time you 
are given Yondelis for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, it will take about 24 hours for all of the 
solution to enter your blood. It will take 3 hours for the treatment of ovarian cancer. </p>
<p>In order to avoid irritation at the site of injection it is recommended that Yondelis is given to you 
through a central venous line.  </p>
<p>You will be given a medicine before and as needed during the treatment with Yondelis in order to 
protect your liver and to reduce the risk of side effects such as feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting.  </p>
<p>The infusion is given to you every 3 weeks, although occasionally your doctor may recommend 
dose delays to ensure that you receive the most appropriate dose of Yondelis. </p>
<p>The length of your whole treatment period will depend on your progress and how well you feel. 
Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment lasts. If you have any further questions on the

</li>
<li>
<p>You may have a reaction at the site of injection. Yondelis infusion may leak out of your vein 
while you are being given it, leading to damage and death of your tissue cells around the 
injection site (tissue necrosis, see also section 2 “Warnings and precautions”) which may 
require surgery. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could have an allergic reaction. In this case you may experience fever, difficulty in 
breathing, redness or flushing of the skin or a rash, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick

<li>
<p>Your doctor may require blood tests in certain situations in order to avoid that you develop 
muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis). In very severe cases this could lead to kidney failure. If 
you experience severe muscle pain or weakness, you should seek medical attention 
immediately. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may experience difficulty in breathing, irregular heartbeat, decreased urine output, abrupt 
change in mental status, areas of mottled skin, extremely low blood pressure associated with 
abnormal laboratory test results (decrease in platelet count). If you get any of the above 
symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. </p>

<p>It could lead to damage and death of your tissue cells around the injection site (tissue 
necrosis) which may require surgery. </p>
<p>Some of the symptoms or signs of extravasation may not be visible until several hours after it 
occurred. There may be blistering, peeling and darkening of the skin over the site. It is 
possible for it to take a few days before the full extent of tissue damage is visible. If you get 
any of the previous described symptoms or signs, seek medical care immediately. </p>
<p>Rare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people </p>
<ul>
<li>You may experience yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice), pain in the upper right 
area of your abdomen, nausea, vomiting, a general sense of not feeling well, difficulty in
