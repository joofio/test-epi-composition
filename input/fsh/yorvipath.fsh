and is needed to keep the amount of calcium and phosphate in your body within the normal range. </p>
<p>Yorvipath is used to treat chronic hypoparathyroidism in adults. In people with hypoparathyroidism, 
the body produces no or too little PTH. Because of this, they cannot keep the levels of calcium and 
phosphate within a normal range, and this leads to the symptoms of the condition, such as muscle 
spasms, twitching, and tingling in your fingertips, toes and lips. Yorvipath replaces the missing PTH 
to help control the levels of calcium and phosphate. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Yorvipath.  </p>
<p>If you are treated with Yorvipath, you may have side effects related to low or high levels of calcium in 
your blood (see section 4 for more information). These effects are more likely to occur when starting 
treatment or when changing the dose. Your doctor will check your calcium levels (see ‘Tests and 
checks’ in section 3). You may be given medicines to treat or help prevent these side effects, or your 
doctor may change your dose. </p>
<p>High levels of calcium in your blood can cause problems if you take medicines that contain cardiac 
glycosides (such as digoxin or digitoxin) (see ‘Other medicines and Yorvipath'). Your doctor will 
check your calcium (see ‘Tests and checks’ in section 3) and glycoside levels and monitor you for 
signs and symptoms. </p>
<p>If you take Yorvipath and have severe kidney or liver impairment, your doctor will check your 
calcium more often (see ‘Tests and checks’ in section 3). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are at higher risk of a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma. This is 
especially important: </p>
<ul>
<li>if you are having or have had radiation therapy to the skeleton </li>
<li>if you have cancer of the bones or other cancer that has spread to your bones </li>
<li>if you have a bone disease that increases your risk of developing osteosarcoma (for instance, if 
you have Paget’s disease) </li>
<li>if a blood test shows that you have unexplained increases in bone alkaline phosphatase </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are at risk for bone fractures, your doctor will check you for osteoporosis. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Yorvipath should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years old because it has not been 
studied in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Yorvipath 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other 
medicines. In particular, tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any of the following: 
* Heart medicines that contain cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin or digitoxin) 
* Medicines used to treat osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, or romosozumab 
* Medicines that can affect calcium levels in your blood, such as diuretics (‘water tablets’, such as 
hydrochloride thiazide or furosemide), systemic corticosteroids (medicines used to treat 
inflammation), and lithium (medicine used to treat mood disorders) </p>
<p>Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of Yorvipath. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy </p>
<p>If you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor. If you become 
pregnant during treatment, talk to your doctor immediately. 
There is limited information on the safety of Yorvipath in pregnant women. Your doctor will decide 
whether you should be treated with Yorvipath during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or planning to 
become pregnant your doctor may check your calcium levels. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding  </p>
<p>If you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before using Yorvipath. 
Your doctor will decide whether you should be treated with Yorvipath during breast-feeding. If you 
are breast-feeding, your doctor may check your calcium levels. </p>
<p>Fertility </p>
<p>It is not known if Yorvipath has effects on fertility. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Yorvipath has no or very minor effects on your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you 
experience dizziness, fainting or light-headedness when standing up, do not drive or use machines 
until you feel better.  </p>
<p>Yorvipath contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

are not sure. </p>
<p>Yorvipath is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). This means that it is 
injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue under the skin. The medicine should be injected into 
the belly (abdomen) or front of the thigh, and it is important to inject into a different area every day to 
help avoid damaging your skin. You can change between the left and right side of the belly and 
between the left and right front of the thigh. </p>
<p>Before you use the pen for the first time, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will show you how to inject 
Yorvipath. Additional help with using Yorvipath is provided in the instructions for use at the end of 
this leaflet. </p>
<p>You should always use the pen as described in the instructions for use. </p>
<p>Starting, changing dose, and maintenance of Yorvipath </p>
<p>Your doctor will do a blood test to check your calcium and vitamin D levels before you start treatment 
with Yorvipath.  </p>
<p>The recommended starting dose of Yorvipath is 18 micrograms once daily. Your doctor may advise 
you to gradually change your dose based on your response to the medicine, until you are using a dose 
that keeps the amount of calcium in your body within the normal range without the need for active 
vitamin D or therapeutic doses of calcium. Your doctor may tell you to keep taking daily calcium 
supplementation to meet dietary requirements. Your dose may be increased if at least 7 days have 
passed since your last change in dose. Your dose may be decreased no more often than every 3 days 
when the level of calcium in your body is too high.  </p>
<p>Tests and checks </p>
<p>Your doctor will check how you respond to the treatment: 
* 7 days after starting treatment and 
* 7 to 14 days after your dose is changed 
This will be done using tests to measure the level of calcium in your blood or urine. Your doctor may 
tell you to change the amount of calcium or vitamin D you take (in any form, including foods rich in 
calcium). </p>
<p>Directions for use </p>
<p>If your dose is above 30 micrograms per day: 
* Administer two injections, one after the other, in separate injection sites. 
* It is recommended to use a different Yorvipath pen for the second daily injection, even if the 
two pens have the same-coloured push button (same strength). 
* The table below explains how to administer your dose. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. </p>

<p>If you use more Yorvipath than you should<br />
Immediately contact your doctor or nurse and describe any symptoms you get. </p>
<p>An overdose may lead to high levels of calcium in the blood. Symptoms may include but are not 
limited to being sick (vomiting), dizziness, feeling thirsty, confusion, muscle weakness, and irregular 
heartbeat. See section 4 for more information. </p>
<p>If you forget to use Yorvipath 
If you forget to inject a dose of Yorvipath, you can use the medicine as soon as you remember if less 
than 12 hours have passed. For example, if you normally inject the medicine at 8 o’clock in the 
morning, you can inject the missed dose before 8 o’clock in the evening. </p>
<p>If you only remember to use your dose within 12 hours of your next planned dose, skip the missed 
dose and continue injecting your next dose as you normally would. For example, if you remember at 
10 o’clock in the evening that you forgot to inject Yorvipath, and your next dose is planned at 
8 o’clock in the morning, you should not inject the missed dose. </p>
<p>Never take a second dose to make up for a missed dose. </p>
<p>If you stop using Yorvipath 
Do not stop using Yorvipath without talking to your doctor. If you stop using Yorvipath the levels of 
calcium in your blood may decrease and you may develop the symptoms described below (see 
section 4).  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of Yorvipath, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
