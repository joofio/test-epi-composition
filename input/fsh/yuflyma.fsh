  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Yuflyma contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body s immune (defence) 
system. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: 
* Rheumatoid arthritis 
* Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
* Enthesitis-related arthritis 
* Ankylosing spondylitis 
* Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis 
* Psoriatic arthritis 
* Plaque psoriasis 
* Hidradenitis suppurativa 
* Crohn s disease 
* Ulcerative colitis 
* Non-infectious uveitis </p>
<p>The active ingredient in Yuflyma, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are 
proteins that attach to a specific target in the body. </p>
<p>The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), which is involved in the </p>
<p>immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By 
attaching to TNF , Yuflyma decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. You may first be given other 
disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, 
you will be given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Yuflyma can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous 
methotrexate treatment. </p>
<p>Yuflyma can slow down the damage to the joints caused by the inflammatory disease and can help them 
move more freely. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide if Yuflyma should be used with methotrexate or alone. </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis </p>
<p>Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years of age. You may 
first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough 
to these medicines, you will be given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Your doctor will decide if Yuflyma should be used with methotrexate or alone. </p>
<p>Enthesitis-related arthritis </p>
<p>Enthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints and the places where tendons join the 
bone. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years of age. You may first be given 
other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis </p>
<p>Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis 
are inflammatory diseases of the spine. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat severe ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond 
well enough to these medicines, you will be given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis </p>
<p>Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints that is usually associated with psoriasis. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Yuflyma can slow down the damage to the joints caused 
by the disease and can help them move more freely. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not </p>
<p>respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis </p>
<p>Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. 
Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away from the 
nail bed which can be painful. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat 
* moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults and 
* severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical 
therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. </p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa </p>
<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin 
disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most 
commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and 
buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat 
* moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and 
* moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. </p>
<p>Yuflyma can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses caused by the disease and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to 
these medicines, you will be given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Crohn s disease </p>
<p>Crohn s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract.  </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat 
* moderate to severe Crohn s disease in adults and 
* moderate to severe Crohn s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. </p>
<p>You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be 
given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat<br />
<em> moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and<br />
</em> moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.  </p>
<p>You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be 
given Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis </p>
<p>Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  </p>
<p>Yuflyma is used to treat 
* adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye 
* children with chronic non-infectious uveitis from 2 years of age with inflammation affecting the 
front of the eye. </p>
<p>This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or 
wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Yuflyma works by reducing this inflammation. </p>
<p>You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be 
given Yuflyma. </p>         </div>"""

<p>If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see  Warnings and precautions ). It is 
important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, for example, fever, wounds, 
feeling tired, dental problems. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition (see  Warnings and precautions ). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Yuflyma. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions </p>
<ul>
<li>If you get allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or 
rash do not inject more Yuflyma and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these 
reactions can be life threatening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Infections </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have an infection, including long-term infection or an infection in one part of the body (for 
example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting Yuflyma. If you are unsure, contact your 
doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Yuflyma treatment. This risk may 
increase if you have problems with your lungs. These infections may be serious and include: </p>
</li>
<li>tuberculosis </li>
<li>infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria </li>
<li>severe infection in the blood (sepsis) </li>
</ul>
<p>In rare cases, these infections can be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get 
symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may tell you to stop 
using Yuflyma for some time. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you live or travel in regions where fungal infections (for example, histoplasmosis, 
coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis) are very common. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have had infections which keep coming back or other conditions that increase 
the risk of infections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are over 65 years you may be more likely to get infections while taking Yuflyma. You and 
your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with 
Yuflyma. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, 
feeling tired or dental problems. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuberculosis </p>
<ul>
<li>It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in 
close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If you have active tuberculosis, do not use 
Yuflyma. </li>
<li>As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Yuflyma, your doctor will 
check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Yuflyma. This will include a 
thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening tests (for 
example, chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be 
recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. </li>
<li>Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received treatment for the prevention 
of tuberculosis. </li>
<li>If symptoms of tuberculosis (for example, cough that does not go away, weight loss, lack of 
energy, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor 
immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hepatitis B </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV or if you 
think you might be at risk of getting HBV. </li>
<li>Your doctor should test you for HBV. In people who carry HBV, Yuflyma can cause the virus to 
become active again. </li>
<li>In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, 
reactivation of HBV can be life-threatening. </li>
</ul>
<p>Surgery or dental procedure </p>
<ul>
<li>If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, please inform your doctor that you are taking 
Yuflyma. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Yuflyma. </li>
</ul>
<p>Demyelinating disease </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have or develop a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the 
nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to 
receive Yuflyma. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your 
vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccinations </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving Yuflyma. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. </p>
</li>
<li>It is recommended that children, if possible, be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age 
before they start treatment with Yuflyma. </li>
<li>If you received Yuflyma while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting 
such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last Yuflyma dose you received </li>
</ul>
<p>during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care 
professionals about your Yuflyma use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby 
should receive any vaccine. </p>
<p>Heart failure </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have mild heart failure and are being treated with Yuflyma, your heart failure status must be 
closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious 
heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, 
or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will decide if you 
should receive Yuflyma. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale </p>
<ul>
<li>In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or 
help you to stop bleeding. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. If you develop a fever that does 
not go away, develop light bruises or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cancer </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking 
Yuflyma or other TNF blockers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time may have 
a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph system) and 
leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). </p>
</li>
<li>If you take Yuflyma the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On 
rare occasions, an uncommon and severe type of lymphoma, has been seen in patients taking 
Yuflyma. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine. </li>
<li>Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with Yuflyma. </li>
<li>Cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Yuflyma. </li>
<li>
<p>If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell 
your doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. If 
you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with 
a TNF blocker is appropriate for you. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Autoimmune disease </p>
<ul>
<li>On rare occasions, treatment with Yuflyma could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your doctor 
if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents </p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccinations: if possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Yuflyma. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines and Yuflyma </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. You 
should not take Yuflyma with medicines containing the following active substances due to increased 
risk of serious infection: </p>
<ul>
<li>anakinra </li>
<li>abatacept. </li>
</ul>
<p>Yuflyma can be taken together with: 
* methotrexate 
* certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (for example, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, 
leflunomide and injectable gold preparations) 
* steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). </p>
<p>If you have questions, please ask your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<ul>
<li>You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for 
at least 5 months after the last Yuflyma treatment. </li>
<li>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice about taking this medicine. </li>
<li>Yuflyma should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. </li>
<li>According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received Yuflyma during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not 
receive Yuflyma. </li>
<li>Yuflyma can be used during breast-feeding. </li>
<li>If you receive Yuflyma during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an 
infection. </li>
<li>It is important that you tell your baby s doctors and other health care professionals about your 
Yuflyma use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information on 
vaccines see the  Warnings and precautions  section. </li>
</ul>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Yuflyma may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning sensation 
and vision disturbances may occur after taking Yuflyma. </p>
<p>YUFLYMA contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.4 mL dose, i.e. essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
