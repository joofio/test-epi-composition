ZALTRAP contains the active substance aflibercept, a protein that works by blocking the growth of 
new blood vessels within the tumour. The tumour needs nutrients and oxygen from blood in order to 
grow. By blocking the growth of blood vessels, ZALTRAP helps to stop or slow down the growth of 
the tumour. </p>
<p>What ZALTRAP is used for 
ZALTRAP is a medicine used to treat advanced cancers of the colon or rectum (parts of the large 
intestine) in adults. It will be given with other medicines called  chemotherapy , including 
 5-fluorouracil ,  folinic acid , and  irinotecan .  </p>         </div>"""

<em> if you are allergic to aflibercept or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section  6).<br />
</em> in your eye, since it may severely damage it. </p>
<p>Please also read the package leaflets for the other medicines ( chemotherapy ) that are part of your 
treatment, to see if they are suitable for you. If you are unsure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if 
there are any reasons why you cannot use these medicines. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given ZALTRAP and during your treatment if: 
* you have any bleeding problems or if you notice any bleeding after treatment (see section 4) or if 
you feel extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, or have changes in the colour of your stool. If the 
bleeding is severe, your doctor will stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. This is because 
ZALTRAP may increase the risk of bleeding. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction and especially if you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate 
(used to treat or prevent bone disorders). A side effect called osteonecrosis (bone damage in the 
jaw) has been reported in cancer patients treated with ZALTRAP. You may be advised to have a 
dental check-up before you start treatment with ZALTRAP. While being treated with ZALTRAP, 
you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine 
dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you also have 
previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates dental treatment or dental 
surgery, (e.g. tooth extractions), should be avoided. Inform your doctor about your dental 
treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with ZALTRAP.  Contact your doctor 
and dentist immediately during and after treatment with ZALTRAP if you experience any 
problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or 
discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have illnesses where your gut is inflamed, such as an infected section of the bowel wall (also 
called  diverticulitis ), stomach ulcers or colitis. This is because ZALTRAP may increase the risk 
of developing holes in the gut wall. If this should happen to you, your doctor will stop your 
treatment with ZALTRAP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have had any abnormal tube-like connections or passageways inside the body between 
internal organs and skin or other tissues (also called  fistula ). If you develop such a connection or 
passageway during treatment, your doctor will stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have high blood pressure. Zaltrap may increase blood pressure (see section 4) and your doctor 
will need to monitor your blood pressure and may adjust your blood pressure medicines or your 
dose of ZALTRAP. It is therefore also important to tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you 
have other heart problems since high blood pressure could make these worse.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in 
a blood vessel wall. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you experience shortness of breath (dyspnea) when you exert yourself or when you lie down, 
excessive tiredness or leg swelling which may be signs of heart failure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you experience signs of a blood clot (see section 4). The signs of a blood clot may vary depending 
on where it appears (e.g. lungs, leg, heart or brain) but may include symptoms such as chest pain, 
coughing, being short of breath or having difficulty breathing. Other signs may include swelling in 
one or both legs, pain or tenderness in one or both legs, discolouration and warmth of the skin on 
the affected leg or visible veins. It may also present itself as a sudden numb or weak feeling in the 
face, arms, or legs. Other signs include feeling confused, problems with sight, walking, 
coordination or balance, problems in saying words or slurring of speech. If you experience any of 
these symptoms, talk to your doctor immediatley since your doctor may want to treat your 
symptoms and stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have kidney problems (protein in the urine), since your doctor will monitor your kidney 
function and may need to adjust your dose of ZALTRAP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your number of white blood cells is too low. Zaltrap may reduce the number of white cells in your 
blood and your doctor will monitor your white blood cell count and may give you additional 
medicines to increase it. If your white blood cells are low, your doctor may need to delay your 
treatment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have severe or long-lasting diarrhoea, feel sick (nausea) or are being sick (vomiting) - these 
could cause severe loss of body fluids (called  dehydration ). Your doctor may need to treat you 
with other medicines and/or fluids given intravenously. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have ever had any allergies - serious allergic reactions can happen during treatment with 
ZALTRAP (see section 4). Your doctor may need to treat the allergic reaction or stop your 
treatment with ZALTRAP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have had a tooth removed or any form of surgery in the last 4 weeks, or you are going to have 
an operation or a dental or medical procedure, or you have a wound after surgery that has not 
healed. Your doctor will temporarily stop the treatment before and after surgery. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you experience fits (seizures). If you experience changes in your vision or confusion, your doctor 
may stop your treatment with ZALTRAP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you are 65 years of age or older and experience diarrhoea, dizziness, weakness, weight loss, or 
severe loss of body fluids (called  dehydration ). Your doctor should monitor you carefully. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your level of everyday activities is limited or worsens on treatment. Your doctor should monitor 
you carefully. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given ZALTRAP and during your treatment.  </p>
<p>During treatment, your doctor will perform a number of tests to monitor the function of your body and 
how the medicine is working. Tests may include blood and urine tests, x-ray or other scanning 
techniques and/or other tests. </p>
<p>ZALTRAP is given by a drip (infusion) into one of your veins ( intra-venous ) to treat advanced 
cancers of the colon or rectum. ZALTRAP must not be injected into the eye, since it may severely 
damage it. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents<br />
This medicine is not for children or adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and 
benefit of using ZALTRAP in children and adolescents have not been shown.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and ZALTRAP 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This may include medicines obtained without a prescription or herbal medicines. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You should not use ZALTRAP during pregnancy unless you and your doctor decide that the benefit 
for you is greater than any possible risk to you or your unborn baby. 
If you are a woman that could become pregnant you should use effective contraception (see 
 Contraception  section below for details on male and female contraception). This medicine may harm 
your unborn baby since it may stop new blood vessels from forming. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before being given this medicine if you are breast-feeding. This is because it is not 
known if the medicine passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>ZALTRAP may affect male and female fertility. Talk to your doctor for advice if you plan to have or 
father a child. </p>
<p>Contraception<br />
Men and women who can father or have children should use effective contraception: 
* during treatment with ZALTRAP and<br />
* for at least 6 months after the last dose of treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
You may have side effects that affect your sight, concentration or ability to react. If this happens, do 
not drive or use any tools or machines. </p>
<p>ZALTRAP contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 22 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This 
is equivalent to 1.1% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. </p>         </div>"""
