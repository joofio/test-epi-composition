ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); 
  if you suffer from a certain type of heart rhythm disorder (second or third degree 
atrioventricular (AV) block). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zebinix. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately: 
  if you have blistering or peeling of the skin and/or mucous membranes, rash, swallowing or 
breathing problems, swelling of your lips, face, eyelids, throat or tongue. These could be signs 
of an allergic reaction.<br />
  if you suffer from confusion, worsening of seizures or decreased consciousness which can be 
signs of low blood salt levels. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor:<br />
  if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose. Zebinix is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal disease. 
  if you have liver problems. Zebinix is not recommended in patients with severe liver problems. 
  if you are taking any medicine which can cause an abnormality on the ECG (electrocardiogram) 
called increased PR interval. If you are not sure if the medicines you are taking could have this 
effect, discuss with your doctor. 
  if you suffer from a heart disease such as heart failure or heart attack, or have any heart rhytm 
disorder. 
  if you suffer from seizures that begin with a widespread electric discharge that involves both 
sides of the brain.  </p>
<p>A small number of people being treated with antiepileptics have had thoughts of harming or killing 
themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, when taking Zebinix, contact your doctor 
immediately. </p>
<p>Zebinix may make you feel dizzy and/or drowsy, particularly at the beginning of treatment. Take 
special care when taking Zebinix to avoid accidental injury, such as fall. </p>
<p>Take special care with Zebinix: 
Serious and potentially life-threatening skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic 
epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been 
reported in post-marketing experience in patients treated with Zebinix.<br />
If you develop a serious rash or another skin symptoms (see section 4), stop taking Zebinix and 
contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. </p>
<p>In patients of Han Chinese or Thai origin the risk of serious skin reactions associated with 
carbamazepine or chemically-related compounds may be predicted by testing a blood sample of these 
patients. Your doctor should be able to advise if a blood test is necessary before taking Zebinix. </p>
<p>Children 
Zebinix is not to be given to children aged 6 years and below. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zebinix 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is just in case any of them interfere with how Zebinix works or how Zebinix interferes 
with their effect.<br />
Tell your doctor if you are taking: 
* phenytoin (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may need to be adjusted; 
* carbamazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) since your dose may have to be adjusted and the 
following side effects of Zebinix may occur in higher frequency: seeing double, abnormal 
coordination and dizziness; 
* hormonal contraceptives (such as the contraceptive pill) since Zebinix may make these less 
effective; 
* simvastatin (a medicine used to lower cholesterol levels) since your dose may have to be adjusted; 
* rosuvastatin, a medicine used to lower cholesterol level; 
* the blood thinner - warfarin; 
* monoamino oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) antidepressants; 
* do not take oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) with Zebinix, as it is not known 
whether it is safe to take these medicines together. </p>
<p>See  Pregnancy and breast-feeding  section for advice about contraception. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p>
<p>It is not recommended to take Zebinix if you are pregnant, as the effects of Zebinix on pregnancy and 
the unborn baby are not known. </p>
<p>If you are planning a pregnancy, talk to your doctor before you stop contraception and before you 
become pregnant. Your doctor may decide to change your treatment. </p>
<p>There are limited data from the use of eslicarbazepine acetate in pregnant women. Research has shown 
an increased risk of birth defects and problems with neurodevelopment (development of the brain) in 
children of women taking antiepileptic medicines particularly when more than one antiepileptic 
medicine is taken at the same time.  </p>
<p>If you are or think you might be pregnant, tell your doctor straight away. You should not stop taking 
your medicine until you have discussed this with your doctor. Stopping your medication without 
consulting your doctor could cause seizures, which could be dangerous to you and your unborn child. 
Your doctor may decide to change your treatment.  </p>
<p>If you are a woman of childbearing age and are not planning a pregnancy; you should use effective 
contraception during treatment with Zebinix. Zebinix may affect how hormonal contraceptives, such 
as the contraceptive (birth control) pill, work and make them less effective at preventing pregnancy. 
Therefore, it is recommended that you use other forms of safe and effective contraception, when 
taking Zebinix. Talk to your doctor, who will discuss with you the most suitable type of contraception 
to use while you are taking Zebinix. If treatment with Zebinix is discontinued you should continue 
using effective contraception up to the end of the current menstrual cycle. </p>
<p>If you take Zebinix during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. 
Your doctor may give you and your baby a medicine to prevent this.  </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed while you are taking Zebinix. It is not known whether it passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zebinix may make you feel dizzy, drowsy and affect your vision, particularly at the beginning of 
treatment. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. </p>         </div>"""

decide whether you will be given this dose for one or two weeks.  </p>
<p>Maintenance dose 
The usual maintenance dose is 800 mg once daily. 
Depending on how you respond to Zebinix, your dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily. If you 
are taking Zebinix on its own your doctor may consider you can benefit of a dose of 1,600 mg once 
daily. </p>
<p>Patients with kidney problems 
If you have kidney problems you will usually be given a lower dose of Zebinix. Your doctor will work 
out the correct dose for you. Zebinix is not recommended if you have severe kidney problems. </p>
<p>Elderly (over 65 years of age) 
If you are elderly and taking Zebinix on its own the dose of 1,600 mg is not a suitable dose for you. </p>
<p>Children above 6 years of age </p>
<p>Dose when you start treatment 
The starting dose is 10 mg per kg body weight taken once a day for one or two weeks, before 
increasing to the maintenance dose.  </p>
<p>Maintenance dose 
Depending on the response to Zebinix, the dose may be increased by 10 mg per kg body weight, at 
intervals of one or two weeks, up to 30 mg per kg body weight. The maximum dose is 1,200 mg once 
daily. </p>
<p>Children with  60 kg 
Children with 60 kg or more body weight should take the same dose as adults. </p>
<p>Other form of this medicine, like oral suspension, maybe more suitable for children. Ask your doctor 
or pharmacist. </p>
<p>Method and route of administration 
Zebinix is for oral use. Swallow the tablet with a glass of water.<br />
Zebinix tablets may be taken with or without food. 
If you have difficulty swallowing the whole tablet, you may crush the tablet and add it to a small 
amount of water or apple sauce and take all the dose immediately. 
The tablet can be divided into equal doses. </p>
<p>If you take more Zebinix than you should 
If you accidently take more Zebinix than you should, you are potentially at risk of having more 
seizures; or you may feel like your heart beat is irregular or faster. Contact a doctor or go to a hospital 
immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. Take the medicine pack with you. This is 
so the doctor knows what you have taken. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Zebinix 
If you forget to take a tablet, take it as soon as you remember and carry on as usual. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Zebinix 
Do not stop taking your tablets suddenly. If you do, you are at risk of having more seizures. Your 
doctor will decide how long you should take Zebinix. Should your doctor decide to stop your 
treatment with Zebinix your dose will usually be reduced gradually. It is important that your treatment 
is completed as advised by your doctor or your symptoms may get worse. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
