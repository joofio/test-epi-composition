● 
If you are allergic to vemurafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6 of this leaflet). Symptoms of allergic reactions may include swelling of the face, lips 
or tongue, difficulty breathing, rash, or fainting sensation. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Zelboraf. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions 
● 
Allergic reactions can happen while taking Zelboraf and may be severe. Stop taking 
Zelboraf and get medical help immediately if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction 
such as swelling of the face, lips or tongue, difficulty breathing, rash, or fainting sensation. </p>
<p>Severe skin reactions 
● 
Severe skin reactions can happen while taking Zelboraf. Stop taking Zelboraf and talk to 
your doctor immediately if you get a skin rash with any of the following symptoms: blisters on </p>
<p>your skin, blisters or sores in your mouth, peeling of your skin, fever, redness or swelling of 
your face, hands, or soles of your feet. </p>
<p>Previous history of cancer 
● 
Tell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma, as Zelboraf may 
cause progression of certain types of cancers. </p>
<p>Radiation therapy reactions 
● 
Tell your doctor if you have had, or are going to have radiotherapy, as Zelboraf may 
worsen radiation treatment side effects.  </p>
<p>Heart disorder 
● 
Tell your doctor if you have a heart disorder, such as an alteration of the electrical activity 
of your heart called “QT prolongation”. Your doctor will run tests to check that your heart is 
working properly before and during your treatment with Zelboraf. If necessary, your doctor may 
decide to interrupt your treatment temporarily or stop it altogether. </p>
<p>Eye problems 
● 
You should have your eyes examined by your doctor while you are taking Zelboraf. Tell 
your doctor immediately if you get eye pain, swelling, redness, blurred vision or other vision 
changes during your treatment. </p>
<p>Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue disorder<br />
● 
Tell your doctor if you observe any unusual thickening of the palms of your hands 
accompanied by tightening of the fingers inward or any unusual thickening of the soles of your 
feet which may be painful. </p>
<p>Checks of your skin before, during and after treatment<br />
● 
If you notice any changes in your skin while taking this medicine, please talk to your 
doctor as soon as possible. 
● 
Regularly during your treatment and up to 6 months after your treatment, your doctor needs to 
check your skin for a type of cancer called “cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma”.<br />
● 
Usually, this lesion appears on sun-damaged skin, remains local and can be cured by surgical 
removal.<br />
● 
If your doctor finds this type of skin cancer, he or she will treat it or send you to another doctor 
for treatment.<br />
● 
Additionally, your doctor needs to inspect your head, your neck, your mouth, your lymph 
glands and you will undergo CT scans regularly. This is a precautionary measure in case a 
squamous cell carcinoma lesion would develop inside your body. Genital examinations (for 
women) and anal examinations are also recommended before and at the end of your treatment. <br />
● 
You may develop new melanoma lesions while taking Zelboraf. These lesions are usually 
removed by surgery and patients continue their treatment. Monitoring of these lesions occurs as 
outlined above for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.  </p>
<p>Kidney or liver problems 
● 
Tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems. This may affect the activity of 
Zelboraf. Your doctor will also do some blood tests to check your liver and kidney functions 
before you start taking Zelboraf and during treatment. </p>
<p>Sun protection 
● 
If you are taking Zelboraf, you may become more sensitive to sunlight and get sunburns that can 
be severe. During treatment, avoid exposing your skin to direct sunlight. 
● 
If you do plan to go into the sun: 
● wear clothing which protects your skin, including your head and face, arms and legs; </p>
<p>● use a lip balm and a broad spectrum sunscreen (minimum of Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 30, 
re-applied every 2 to 3 hours). 
● 
This will help to protect you against sunburn.  </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Zelboraf is not recommended for children and adolescents. The effects of Zelboraf in people younger 
than 18 years old are not known.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zelboraf 
Before starting treatment, tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might use 
any other medicines (including those you have bought for yourself from a pharmacy, supermarket or 
health store). This is very important, as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen 
or weaken the effect of medicines.  </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking: 
● Medicines that are known to affect the way your heart beats:<br />
● medicines for heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone) 
● medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine) 
● medicines for bacterial infections (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin) 
● medicines for nausea and vomiting (e.g. ondansetron, domperidone). 
● 
Medicines that are mainly eliminated by metabolising proteins called CYP1A2 (e.g caffeine, 
olanzapine, theophylline), CYP3A4 (e.g. some oral contraceptives) or called CYP2C8. ● 
Medicines that influence a protein called P-gp or BCRP (e.g. verapamil, cyclosporine, ritonavir, 
quinidine, itraconazole, gefitinib). 
● 
Medicines that could be influenced by a protein called P-gp (e.g. aliskiren, colchicine, digoxin, 
everolimus, fexofenadine) or a protein called BCRP (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, 
rosuvastatin). 
● 
Medicines that stimulate the metabolising proteins called CYP3A4 or a metabolising process 
called glucuronidation (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John’s Wort) 
● 
Medicines that strongly inhibit the metabolising protein called CYP3A4  (e.g. ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, nefazodone, 
atazanavir) 
● 
A medicine used to prevent blood clots called warfarin 
● 
A medicine called ipilimumab, another medicine for the treatment of melanoma. The 
combination of this medicine with Zelboraf is not recommended due to increased toxicity to the 
liver. </p>
<p>If you are taking any of these medicines (or if you are not sure), please talk to your doctor before 
taking Zelboraf. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
● 
Use an appropriate method of contraception during your treatment and for at least 
6 months after the end of your treatment. Zelboraf may decrease the efficacy of some oral 
contraceptives. Please tell your doctor if you are taking an oral contraceptive. 
● 
Zelboraf is not recommended for use during pregnancy unless your doctor considers that the 
benefit for the mother outweighs the risk for the baby. There is no information about the safety 
of Zelboraf in pregnant women. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become 
pregnant.<br />
● 
It is not known whether the ingredients in Zelboraf pass into human milk. Breast-feeding is not 
recommended during treatment with Zelboraf. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines </p>
<p>Zelboraf has side effects that can affect your ability to drive or to operate machines. Beware of fatigue 
or eye problems that could be a reason for not driving. </p>
