reduce the number of white blood cells (lymphocytes) circulating freely round the body. </p>
<p>Zeposia is indicated for the following diseases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple sclerosis </li>
<li>Ulcerative colitis </li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple sclerosis 
Zeposia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS) with active disease. 
* Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the immune system (the body s defenses, 
including white blood cells) wrongly attack the protective coat around the nerves in the brain 
and spinal cord. This stops the nerves from working properly and may result in symptoms such 
as: numbness, difficulty in walking, and problems with vision and balance. 
* In relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, attacks on the nerve cells are followed by periods of 
recovery. The symptoms may disappear during the recovery periods, but some problems may 
remain. </p>
<p>Zeposia helps to protect against attacks on the nerves by stopping certain white blood cells reaching 
the brain and spine where they could cause inflammation and damage the nerves protective coating.  </p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis 
Zeposia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis (UC). 
* Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will 
first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough or are intolerant to these 
medicines, you may be given Zeposia to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. </p>
<p>Zeposia helps to reduce the inflammation in ulcerative colitis by stopping certain white blood cells 
from reaching the intestinal lining. </p>         </div>"""

* if you are allergic to ozanimod or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
* if your healthcare professional has told you that you have a severely weakened immune system 
* if you have had a heart attack, angina, stroke or mini-stroke (Transient Ischemic Attack - TIA), 
or certain types of severe heart failure in the last 6 months 
* if you have certain types of irregular or abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmia)   your doctor will 
check your heart before starting treatment 
* if you have severe infection such as hepatitis or tuberculosis 
* if you have cancer<br />
* if you have severe liver problems 
* if you are pregnant or a women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.  </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zeposia if: 
* you have a slow heart rate or you are taking or have recently taken medicines that slow your 
heart rate (such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers); 
* you have untreated severe breathing problems when you sleep (severe sleep apnoea); 
* you have problems with your liver; 
* you have an infection; 
* you have low levels of a type of white blood cell - called lymphocytes; 
* you have never had, or are not sure if you have had chickenpox; 
* you have recently had or are planning to have a vaccination; 
* you or others notice worsening of your MS symptoms as well as any new or unfamiliar 
symptoms. These may be due to a rare infection of the brain called progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML); 
* you have ever had problems with your vision or other symptoms of build-up of fluid in the 
central area of the retina called the macula (a condition called macular oedema); 
* you have inflammation of the eye (uveitis); 
* you have diabetes (which can cause problems with your eyes); 
* you have severe lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); 
Before you start taking Zeposia, your doctor will check your heart using an electrocardiogram (ECG). 
If you have certain heart conditions your doctor will monitor you for at least the first 6 hours after 
your first dose. </p>
<p>As Zeposia can increase your blood pressure, your doctor may want to check your blood pressure 
regularly. </p>
<p>While you are taking Zeposia (and for up to 3 months after you stop taking it), you may get infections 
more easily. Any infection that you already have may get worse. Talk to your doctor if you develop 
an infection. </p>
<p>During treatment with Zeposia, if you develop disturbance of vision, progressive weakness, 
clumsiness, memory loss or confusion, or if you have MS and you think your disease is getting 
progressively worse, speak to your doctor straight away. These symptoms may be due to PML, a rare 
brain infection that may lead to severe disability or death.  </p>
<p>During treatment with Zeposia, if you develop a severe headache, feel confused, or have seizures 
(fits) and loss of vision, speak to your doctor straight away. These symptoms may be due to a 
syndrome called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). </p>
<p>As Zeposia may increase the risk of skin cancer, you should limit your exposure to sun light and UV 
(ultraviolet) light, by wearing protective clothing and applying regular sunscreen (with high sun 
protection factor). </p>
<p>Women of childbearing potential 
If used during pregnancy, Zeposia can harm the unborn baby. Before you start treatment with 
Zeposia, your doctor will explain the risk to you and ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure 
that you are not pregnant. Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not 
become pregnant while taking Zeposia. It also explains what you should do to avoid becoming 
pregnant while you are taking Zeposia. You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
3 months after stopping treatment (see section  Pregnancy and breast-feeding ). </p>
<p>If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zeposia. </p>
<p>Worsening of MS after stopping Zeposia treatment 
Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with 
Zeposia (see  If you stop taking Zeposia  in section 3). </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents aged under 18 years. This is because Zeposia 
has not been studied in children and adolescents. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zeposia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Zeposia can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other 
medicines can affect the way Zeposia works.  </p>
<p>In particular, before taking Zeposia, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently 
taken any of the following medicines: </p>
<ul>
<li>medicines which suppress or modulate your immune system (e.g. ciclosporin)  </li>
<li>medicines used to treat MS, such as alemtuzumab, beta interferon, dimethyl fumarate, 
glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab or teriflunomide </li>
<li>medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis, such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine </li>
<li>gemfibrozil to reduce levels of fats or cholesterol in the blood </li>
<li>clopidogrel, medicine used to prevent blood clots </li>
<li>rifampicin, an antibiotic for treating tuberculosis and other serious infections </li>
<li>medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors for treating depression (e.g. phenelzine) or 
Parkinson s disease (e.g. selegiline)  </li>
<li>
<p>medicines that slow your heart rate (such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>certain type of vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for 3 months 
after treatment. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding<br />
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
Do not use Zeposia during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman 
who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. If Zeposia is used during 
pregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. If you are a woman who could become 
pregnant, your doctor will inform you about this risk before you start treatment with Zeposia and will 
ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective 
contraception while taking Zeposia and for at least 3 months after you stop taking it. Ask your doctor 
about reliable methods of contraception.<br />
Your doctor will give you a card which explains why you should not become pregnant while taking 
Zeposia. </p>
<p>If you do become pregnant while taking Zeposia, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will 
decide to stop treatment (see  If you stop taking Zeposia  in section 3). Specialised pre-natal 
monitoring will be performed. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed while you are taking Zeposia. Zeposia can pass into breast milk and there 
is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zeposia has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. </p>
<p>Zeposia contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much to take 
When you first start taking Zeposia, you need to take at a low dose and gradually build up, to reduce 
any effect in slowing your heart rate. 
* You will be given a  treatment initiation pack  to help you start treatment in this way. It 
contains: * 
4 light-grey capsules, containing 0.23 mg ozanimod. You take one of these on days 1 to 4 
of treatment. * 
3 light-grey and orange capsules, containing 0.46 mg ozanimod. You take one of these 
on days 5, 6 and 7. * On day 8 and thereafter, once you have completed the  initiation pack , you will move on to a 
 maintenance pack  with orange capsules each containing the recommended dose of 0.92 mg 
ozanimod. You will continue regular treatment with one 0.92 mg capsule daily. If you have 
mild or moderate chronic liver problems, your doctor may need to reduce your  maintenance<br />
dose to one 0.92 mg capsule every other day. </p>
<p>How to take Zeposia 
* Zeposia is for oral use. 
* Swallow the capsule whole.<br />
* You can take the capsule either with or without food. </p>
<p>If you take more Zeposia than you should 
If you take more Zeposia than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take the 
medicine pack and this leaflet with you. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Zeposia 
* If you forget a dose of Zeposia, take it as soon as you remember. However, if you forget the 
dose for the whole day skip the missed dose and take the next dose at your usual time.<br />
* Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
* If you miss one or more doses during the first 14 days of starting Zeposia, talk to your doctor 
about how to re-start your treatment. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Zeposia 
* Do not stop taking Zeposia without talking to your doctor first. 
* Talk to your doctor about how to re-start your treatment if you have stopped taking Zeposia:</p>
<ul>
<li>for 1 day or more during the first 14 days of treatment </li>
<li>for more than 7 consecutive days between day 15 and day 28 of treatment </li>
<li>for more than 14 consecutive days after day 28 of treatment. 
You will need to start the  treatment initiation pack  again. </li>
</ul>
<p>Zeposia will stay in your body for up to 3 months after you stop taking it. Your white blood cell count 
(lymphocyte count) may also remain low during this time and the side effects described in this leaflet 
may still occur (see  Possible side effects  in section 4). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with 
Zeposia.  </p>
