<li>What Zerbaxa is and what it is used for
Zerbaxa is a medicine used to treat a range of bacterial infections. It contains two active substances:</li>
<li>ceftolozane, an antibiotic that belongs to the group of “cephalosporins” and which can kill
certain bacteria that can cause infection;</li>
<li>tazobactam, which blocks the action of certain enzymes called beta-lactamases. These enzymes
make bacteria resistant to ceftolozane by breaking down the antibiotic before it can act. By
blocking their action, tazobactam makes ceftolozane more effective at killing bacteria. 
Zerbaxa is used in all age groups to treat complicated infections within the abdomen, and kidney and
urinary system.
Zerbaxa is also used in adults to treat an infection of the lungs called “pneumonia”.</li>

- if you are allergic to ceftolozane, tazobactam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine
(listed in section 6). 
- if you are allergic to medicines known as “cephalosporins”. 
- if you have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., severe skin peeling; swelling of the face, hands,
feet, lips, tongue or throat; or difficulty swallowing or breathing) to certain other antibiotics
(e.g., penicillins or carbapenems).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zerbaxa if you know you are, or have previously been
allergic to cephalosporins, penicillins or other antibiotics.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you develop diarrhoea while taking Zerbaxa.
Infections caused by bacteria that are not sensitive to Zerbaxa or caused by a fungus can occur during
or following treatment with Zerbaxa. Tell your doctor if you think you may have another infection.
28
Treatment with Zerbaxa sometimes causes production of antibodies that react with your red blood
cells. If you are told that you have an abnormal blood test (called Coombs test) tell your doctor that
you are having or have recently had Zerbaxa.
Children and adolescents
This medicine should not be given to children under 18 years old to treat pneumonia because there is
not enough information on use in this age group for the treatment of this infection.
Other medicines and Zerbaxa
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other
medicines. 
Some medicines may interact with ceftolozane and tazobactam. These include:
- Probenecid (a medicine for gout). This can increase the time it takes for tazobactam to leave
your body.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or think you may be pregnant, ask your doctor or pharmacist for
advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will advise if you should receive Zerbaxa during
pregnancy. 
If you are breast-feeding, your doctor will advise you on whether you should stop breast-feeding or
stop or avoid Zerbaxa therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the
benefit of therapy for you.
Driving and using machines
Zerbaxa may cause dizziness, which can affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Zerbaxa contains sodium
This medicine contains 230 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is
equivalent to 11.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. The
reconstituted vial with 10 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) for injection contains 265 mg
sodium in each vial. This is equivalent to 13.3% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of
sodium for an adult.</p>         </div>"""

or not you have kidney problems.
The dose depends on the type of infection that you have, where the infection is in your body and how
serious the infection is. Your doctor will decide on the dose that you need.
Use in adults
The recommended dose of Zerbaxa is 1 g of ceftolozane and 0.5 g of tazobactam or 2 g of ceftolozane
and 1 g of tazobactam every 8 hours, which is given into one of your veins (directly into the
bloodstream).
Treatment with Zerbaxa normally lasts between 4 and 14 days, depending on the severity and location
of the infection and on how your body responds to the treatment.
Use in children and adolescents
The recommended dose of Zerbaxa is 20 mg/kg of ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg of tazobactam every
8 hours, which is given into one of your veins (directly into the bloodstream). The dose should not
exceed 1 g of ceftolozane and 0.5 g of tazobactam.
29
Treatment with Zerbaxa normally lasts between 5 and 14 days, depending on the severity and location
of the infection and on how your body responds to the treatment.
Patients with kidney problems
Your doctor may need to reduce the dose of Zerbaxa or decide how often Zerbaxa is given to you.
Your doctor may also want to test your blood to make sure you receive an appropriate dose, especially
if you have to take this medicine for a long time.
If you take more Zerbaxa than you should
As this product is given by a doctor or other healthcare professional, it is very unlikely that you will be
given too much Zerbaxa. However, if you have any concerns you should let your doctor, nurse or
pharmacist know immediately.
If you stop taking Zerbaxa
If you think you have not been given a dose of Zerbaxa, tell your doctor or other healthcare
professional immediately.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>         </div>"""
