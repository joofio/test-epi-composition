<p>Zevalin is a kit for the preparation of the active substance ibritumomab tiuxetan [90Y], a monoclonal 
antibody labelled with the radioactive substance yttrium-90 (90Y). Zevalin attaches to a protein 
(CD20) on the surface of certain white blood cells (B-cells) and kills them by irradiation. </p>
<p>Zevalin is used to treat patients suffering from specific subgroups of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(CD20+ indolent or transformed B-cell NHL) if an earlier rituximab, another monoclonal antibody, 
treatment has not worked, or has stopped working (refractory or relapsed disease).   </p>
<p>Zevalin is also used  in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. It is used as a 
consolidation therapy to improve the reduction in the number of lymphoma cells (remission) 
achieved with the initial chemotherapy regimen.  </p>
<p>The use of Zevalin does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the 
procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>You must not be given Zevalin: 
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the following: 
<em>ibritumomab tiuxetan, yttrium chloride or to any of the other ingredients of Zevalin (listed in 
section 6 ‘What Zevalin contains’) 
</em>rituximab or other murine-derived proteins 
- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also section “pregnancy and breast feeding”). </p>
<p>Take special care with Zevalin </p>
<p>In the following cases, Zevalin use is not recommended since its safety and efficacy have not been 
established: 
* more than a quarter of your bone marrow contains malignant abnormal cells. 
* If you have had external beam radiation (a type of radiotherapy) to more than a quarter 
of your bone marrow. 
* If you receive Zevalin alone and the number of your blood platelets is fewer than 
100,000/mm3<br />
* If the number of your blood platelets is fewer than 150,000/mm3 after chemotherapy 
* If the number of your white blood cells is fewer than 1,500/mm3 
* If you have had a bone marrow transplant or have received blood stem cells in the 
past. </p>
<p>If you have been treated with other proteins (especially mouse-derived) before Zevalin treatment, 
you may be more likely to have an allergic reaction. You may, therefore, need to be tested for special 
antibodies.  </p>
<p>In addition, Zevalin is not recommended for the use in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
involving the brain and/or spinal cord as those patients were not included in clinical studies. </p>
<p>Children 
Zevalin is not recommended for use in children below age 18 since safety and efficacy have not been 
established. </p>
<p>Elderly patients 
Limited data in elderly patients (aged 65 years or over) are available. No overall differences in safety 
or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zevalin 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription.<br />
In particular, your doctor will need to interrupt treatment with growth factors such as filgrastim for a 
period of three weeks before giving you Zevalin to two weeks after Zevalin treatment. 
If you are given Zevalin less than 4 months after chemotherapy containing the active substance 
fludarabine, you may have a higher risk of having a reduced number of blood cells.<br />
Please tell your doctor that you were given Zevalin if you are due for vaccination after using it.  </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Zevalin must not be used during pregnancy. Your doctor will perform tests to exclude pregnancy 
before you start the treatment. Women of child-bearing potential and male patients must use reliable 
contraception during treatment with Zevalin and for up to one year after stopping treatment. 
There is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by Zevalin could harm your ovaries and testicles. 
Please ask your doctor how this may affect you, especially if you are planning on having children in 
the future. </p>
<p>Women must not breast-feed during treatment and for 12 months following the treatment. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zevalin can affect your ability to drive and use machines, as dizziness is a common side effect. Please 
be cautious until you are sure you are not affected. </p>
<p>Zevalin contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 28 mg sodium per dose, depending on the radioactivity concentration. 
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.  </p>         </div>"""

  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Zevalin will 
only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by people 
who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe use of 
this product and will keep you informed of their actions. </p>
<p>The dose of Zevalin depends on your body weight, blood platelet counts and what Zevalin is being 
used for (indication). The maximum dose must not exceed 1200 MBq (‘megabecquerel’, a unit to 
measure radioactivity). </p>
<p>Zevalin is used with another medicine containing the active substance rituximab.  </p>
<p>You will be given a total of 3 infusions in the course of two visits to a medical facility, 7 to 9 days 
apart. </p>
<ul>
<li>On day 1 you will be given one rituximab infusion </li>
<li>On day 7, 8, or 9 you will be given one rituximab infusion, followed by one Zevalin infusion 
shortly afterwards (within 4 hours). </li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended dose is: </p>
<p>For consolidation therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma 
 
The usual dose is 15 MBq/kg body weight.  </p>
<p>For therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma not responding to 
rituximab 
 
The usual dose is 11 or 15 MBq per kg body weight, depending on your blood platelet count.  </p>
<p>Preparation of Zevalin 
Zevalin is not used directly, but must be prepared by your healthcare professional first. The kit allows 
the coupling of antibody ibritumomab tiuxetan with the radioactive isotope yttrium 90Y 
(radiolabelling).  </p>
<p>How Zevalin is given 
Zevalin is given by intravenous infusion (drip into a vein) usually lasting about 10 minutes.  </p>
<p>After you are given Zevalin 
The amount of radiation that your body will be exposed to due to Zevalin is smaller than with 
radiotherapy. Most radioactivity will decay within the body, but a small part will be eliminated 
through your urine. Therefore, for one week after the Zevalin infusion you must wash your hands 
thoroughly each time after urinating. </p>
<p>After treatment your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check your platelet and white cell 
counts. These usually decrease around two months after start of treatment.  </p>
<p>If your doctor plans to treat you with some other antibody after treatment with Zevalin, you will need 
to be tested for special antibodies. Your doctor will tell you if this applies to you. </p>
<p>If you have received more Zevalin than you should 
Your doctor will treat you, as appropriate, if you have any particular ill effects. This may include 
discontinuation of Zevalin therapy and treatment with growth factors or your own stem cells. </p>         </div>"""
