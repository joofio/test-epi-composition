medicines called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). </p>
<p>Ziagen does not completely cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps 
it at a low level. It also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood

6) 
Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4.<br />
Check with your doctor if you think   this applies to you.  </p>
<p>Take special care with Ziagen<br />
Some people taking Ziagen for HIV are more at risk of serious side effects. You need to be aware of 
the extra risks: 
* if you have moderate or severe liver disease<br />
* if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C 
* if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman) 
* if you have severe kidney disease 
Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-ups, including 
blood tests, while you are taking your medicine. See Section 4 for more information.  </p>
<p>Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions<br />
Even patients who don’t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a 
serious allergic reaction). </p>
<p>Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4 of this 
leaflet. </p>
<p>Risk of cardiovascular events<br />
It cannot be excluded that abacavir may increase the risk of having cardiovascular events. 
Tell your doctor if you have cardiovascular problems, if you smoke, or have other illnesses that 
may increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, or diabetes. Do not 
stop taking Ziagen unless your doctor advises you to do so. </p>
<p>Look out for important symptoms<br />
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. You 
need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Ziagen. 
Read the information ‘Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV’ in 
Section 4 of this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Ziagen<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or if you have taken any 
recently, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription. Remember 
to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking Ziagen. </p>
<p>Some medicines interact with Ziagen<br />
These include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>phenytoin, for treating epilepsy 
Tell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin. Your doctor may need to monitor you while you are 
taking Ziagen. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>methadone used as a heroin substitute.  Abacavir increases the rate at which methadone is 
removed from the body. If you are taking methadone, you will be checked for any withdrawal 
symptoms. Your methadone dose may need to be changed. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking methadone.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Riociguat, for treating high blood pressure in the blood vessels (the pulmonary arteries) that 
carry blood from the heart to the lungs. Your doctor may need to reduce your riociguat dose, as 
abacavir may increase riociguat blood levels.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy<br />
Ziagen is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Ziagen and similar medicines may cause 
side effects in unborn babies. If you have taken Ziagen during your pregnancy, your doctor may 
request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In 
children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV 
outweighed the risk of side effects. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding<br />
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. A small amount of the ingredients in Ziagen can also pass into your 
breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines<br />
Do not drive or operate machines unless you are feeling well.  </p>
<p>Important information about some of the other ingredients of Ziagen tablets. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>         </div>"""

Swallow the tablets with some water. Ziagen can be taken with or without food. 
If you cannot swallow the tablet(s), you may crush and combine them with a small amount of food or 
drink, and take all the dose immediately.<br />
Stay in regular contact with your doctor<br />
Ziagen helps to control your condition. You need to keep taking it every day to stop your illness 
getting worse. You may still develop other infections and illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
Keep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Ziagen without your doctor’s advice.  </p>
<p>How much to take<br />
Adults, adolescents and children weighing at least 25 kg<br />
The usual dose of Ziagen is 600 mg a day.  This can be taken either as one 300 mg tablet twice a day 
or two 300 mg tablets once a day.<br />
Children from one year of age weighing less than 25 kg<br />
The dose given depends on the body weight of your child.  The recommended dose is: 
* Children weighing at least 20 kg and less than 25 kg: The usual dose of Ziagen is 450 mg a 
day. This can be given as 150 mg (half of a tablet) taken in the morning and 300 mg (one whole 
tablet) taken in the evening, or 450 mg (one and a half tablets) once a day as advised by your 
doctor.<br />
* Children weighing at least 14 kg and less than 20 kg: The usual dose of Ziagen is 300 mg a 
day. This can be given as 150 mg (half of a  tablet) twice daily, or 300 mg (one whole tablet) once 
a day as advised by your doctor.<br />
The tablet can be divided into equal doses. 
An oral solution (20 mg abacavir/ml) is also available for the treatment of children over three months 
of age and weighing less than 14 kg, or for people who need a lower than usual dose, or who cannot 
take tablets.<br />
If you take more Ziagen than you should<br />
If you accidentally take too much Ziagen, tell your doctor or your pharmacist, or contact your nearest 
hospital emergency department for further advice. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Ziagen<br />
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before.<br />
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  </p>
<p>It is important to take Ziagen regularly, because if you take it at irregular intervals, you may be more 
likely to have a hypersensitivity reaction. </p>
<p>If you have stopped taking Ziagen<br />
If you have stopped taking Ziagen for any reason - especially because you think you are having side 
effects, or because you have other illness: 
Talk to your doctor before you start taking it again. Your doctor will check whether your 
symptoms were related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been 
related, you will be told never again to take Ziagen, or any other medicine containing abacavir 
(e.g. Triumeq,Trizivir or Kivexa). It is important that you follow this advice. </p>
<p>If your doctor advises that you can start taking Ziagen again, you may be asked to take your first doses 
in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. </p>         </div>"""

is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  </p>
<p>Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.  </p>
<p>When you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of Ziagen 
or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV disease itself. So it is very important to 
talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. 
Even patients who don’t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity 
reaction (a serious allergic reaction), described in this leaflet in the panel headed ‘Hypersensitivity 
reactions’.  </p>
<p>It is very important that you read and understand the information about this serious 
reaction. </p>
<p>As well as the side effects listed below for Ziagen, other conditions can develop during combination 
therapy for HIV.<br />
It is important to read the information later in this section under ‘Other possible side effects of 
combination therapy for HIV’. 
Hypersensitivity reactions<br />
Ziagen contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in Trizivir , Triumeq and Kivexa). 
Abacavir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. 
These hypersensitivity reactions have been seen more frequently in people taking medicines that 
contain abacavir.  </p>
<p>Who gets these reactions?<br />
Anyone taking Ziagen could develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which could be life 
threatening if they continue to take Ziagen. 
You are more likely to develop such a reaction if you have the HLA-B<em>5701 gene (but you can get a 
reaction even if you do not have this gene). You should have been tested for this gene before Ziagen 
was prescribed for you. If you know you have this gene, tell your doctor before you take Ziagen. 
About 3 to 4 in every 100 patients treated with abacavir in a clinical trial who did not have the HLA-
B</em>5701 gene developed a hypersensitivity reaction. </p>
<p>What are the symptoms?<br />
The most common symptoms are: 
* fever (high temperature) and skin rash 
Other common symptoms are: 
* nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (stomach) pain, severe tiredness 
Other symptoms include: </p>
<p>Pains in the joints or muscles, swelling of the neck, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough, occasional 
headaches, inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), mouth ulcers, low blood pressure, tingling or 
numbness of the hands or feet. </p>
<p>When do these reactions happen?<br />
Hypersensitivity reactions can start at any time during treatment with Ziagen, but are more likely 
during the first 6 weeks of treatment. </p>
<p>If you are caring for a child who is being treated with Ziagen, it is important that you 
understand the information about this hypersensitivity reaction. If your child gets the symptoms 
described below it is essential that you follow the instructions given. </p>
<p>Contact your doctor immediately:<br />
1 
if you get a skin rash, OR 
2 
if you get symptoms from at least 2 of the following groups: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fever  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shortness of breath, sore throat or cough </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>severe tiredness or achiness, or generally feeling ill 
Your doctor may advise you to stop taking Ziagen.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have stopped taking Ziagen<br />
If you have stopped taking Ziagen because of a hypersensitivity reaction, you must NEVER AGAIN 
take Ziagen, or any other medicine containing abacavir (e.g. Trizivir, Triumeq or Kivexa). If you 
do, within hours, your blood pressure could fall dangerously low, which could result in death. 
If you have stopped taking Ziagen for any reason - especially because you think you are having side 
effects, or because you have other illness: 
Talk to your doctor before you start again. Your doctor will check whether your symptoms were 
related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been, you will then be told 
never again to take Ziagen, or any other medicine containing abacavir (e.g. Trizivir, Triumeq or 
Kivexa). It is important that you follow this advice. 
Occasionally, hypersensitivity reactions have developed in people who start taking abacavir containing 
products again, but who had only one symptom on the Alert Card before they stopped taking it. </p>
<p>Very rarely, patients who have taken medicines containing abacavir in the past without any symptoms 
of hypersensitivity have developed a hypersensitivity reaction when they start taking these medicines 
again.  </p>
<p>If your doctor advises that you can start taking Ziagen again, you may be asked to take your first doses 
in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. </p>
<p>If you are hypersensitive to Ziagen, return all your unused Ziagen tablets for safe disposal. Ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice. 
The Ziagen pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity 
reactions. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. </p>
<p>Common side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 10 people: 
* hypersensitivity reaction<br />
* feeling sick (nausea) 
* headache 
* being sick (vomiting) 
* diarrhoea 
* loss of appetite 
* tiredness, lack of energy 
* fever (high temperature) 
* skin rash </p>
<p>Rare side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people:<br />
* inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) </p>
<p>Very rare side effects<br />
These may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people:<br />
* skin rash, which may form blisters and  looks like small targets (central dark spots surrounded by 
a paler area, with a dark ring around the edge) (erythema multiforme) 
* a widespread rash with blisters and peeling skin, particularly around the mouth, nose, eyes and 
genitals (Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and a more severe form causing skin peeling in more than 
30% of the body surface (toxic epidermal necrolysis) 
* lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) </p>
<p>If you notice any of these symptoms contact a doctor urgently.<br />
If you get side effects<br />
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects get severe or troublesome, or if you 
notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. </p>
<p>Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV<br />
Combination therapy including Ziagen may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment.  </p>
<p>Symptoms of infection and inflammation<br />
Old infections may flare up<br />
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When these people start treatment, they may find 
that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. These symptoms are 
probably caused by the body’s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these 
infections.  Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: 
• headache 
• stomach ache 
• difficulty breathing </p>
<p>In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue 
(autoimmune disorders).  The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after 
you start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
• palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
• hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)<br />
• weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body </p>
<p>If you get any symptoms of infection while you are taking Ziagen: 
Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your doctor’s 
advice. </p>
<p>You may have problems with your bones<br />
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
* if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
* if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
* if they drink alcohol 
* if their immune systems are very weak 
* if they are overweight 
Signs of osteonecrosis include:<br />
* stiffness in the joints 
* aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
* difficulty moving 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
Tell your doctor.  </p>
<p>Reporting of side effects<br />
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. </p>         </div>"""
