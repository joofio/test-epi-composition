  * text.div = """<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  <p>Ziextenzo contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by 
biotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very 
similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body.
Ziextenzo is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence 
of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are important 
as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy 
which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells fall to a low 
level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of 
infection.
Your doctor has given you Ziextenzo to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes 
blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.</p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ziextenzo:</p>
<p>if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin 
that itch.</p>
<p>if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory 
Distress Syndrome (ARDS).</p>
<h2>if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:</h2>
<p>swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, 
difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of 
tiredness
These could be symptoms of condition called  Capillary Leak Syndrome  which causes blood to 
leak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section </p>         </div>"""

problem with your spleen (splenomegaly).</p>
<p>if you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary 
oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung 
infiltration).</p>
<p>if you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or 
decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot 
(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely.</p>
<p>if you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely.</p>
<p>if you are a patient with breast cancer or lung cancer, Ziextenzo in combination with 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may increase your risk of a precancerous 
blood condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a blood cancer called acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML). Symptoms may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising 
or bleeding.</p>
<p>if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of 
the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble 
breathing these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction.</p>
<p>if you have symptoms of inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood 
from the heart to the body), this has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. 
The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory 
markers. Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms.
Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as pegfilgrastim can harm the tiny filters inside 
your kidneys (glomerulonephritis).
Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of Ziextenzo. Stop 
using Ziextenzo and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in 
section 4. You should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or 
are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Ziextenzo, unless instructed by your 
doctor.
Loss of response to pegfilgrastim
If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, your 
doctor will investigate the reasons why, including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise pegfilgrastim s activity.
Other medicines and Ziextenzo
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Pegfilgrastim has not been tested 
in pregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you:</p>
<p>are pregnant;</p>
<p>think you may be pregnant; or</p>
<p>are planning to have a baby.
If you become pregnant during Ziextenzo treatment, please inform your doctor. 
Unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Ziextenzo.
Driving and using machines
Ziextenzo has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines.
Ziextenzo contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium
This medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 50 mg/mL.
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
 sodium-free .</p>         </div>"""

skin) using a pre-filled syringe and it should be given at least 24 hours after your last dose of 
chemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle.

side effects:</p>
<p>swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty 
breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These

white blood cell count may become high for a short period of time. Your platelet count may 
become low which might result in bruising.
Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):</p>
<p>allergic-type reactions, including redness and flushing, skin rash, and raised areas of the skin that 
itch.</p>
<p>serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face).</p>
<p>increased spleen size.</p>
<p>spleen rupture. Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. It is important that you contact your 
doctor immediately if you experience pain in the upper left side of the abdomen or left shoulder 
pain since this may relate to a problem with your spleen.</p>
<p>breathing problems. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing please tell your doctor.</p>
<p>Sweet s syndrome (plum-coloured, raised, painful lesions on the limbs and sometimes the face 
and neck with fever) has occurred but other factors may play a role.</p>
