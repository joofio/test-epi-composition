<p>If you are allergic to ceftaroline fosamil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).</p>
<p>If you are allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics</p>

Do not use Zinforo if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse 
before using Zinforo.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Zinforo:</p>
<p>If you have kidney problems (your doctor may have to prescribe a lower dose)</p>
<p>If you have ever had fits (seizures or convulsions)</p>
<p>If you have ever had any non-severe allergic reactions to other antibiotics like penicillin or 
carbapenem</p>
<p>If you have had severe diarrhoea whilst taking antibiotics in the past
You may get another infection caused by another bacteria during or following treatment with Zinforo.
You may develop signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions such as fever, joint pain, skin rash, red 
scaly rash, skin bumps that contain pus, blisters or peeling of skin, red circular patches often with 
central blisters on the trunk, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes. If this happens talk to 
your doctor or nurse immediately.
Lab Test
You may develop an abnormal lab test (called Coombs test) that looks for certain antibodies which 
may act against your red blood cells. If the level of your red blood cells fall your doctor may check to 
see if these antibodies have caused this.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using 
Zinforo.
Other medicines and Zinforo
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor before using Zinforo if you are pregnant. Do not use this medicine during pregnancy 
unless your doctor has told you to.

on the age and weight of the child and is given every 8 or 12 hours. It is given as a drip into a vein 
lasting 5 to 60 minutes if you receive the usual dose or 120 minutes if you receive an increased dose. 
A course of treatment usually lasts for 5 to 14 days for skin infections and 5 to 7 days for pneumonia.

body by the kidneys.

If you miss a dose of Zinforo
If you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
