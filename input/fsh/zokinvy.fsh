<p>Zokinvy contains the active substance lonafarnib. </p>
<p>What Zokinvy is used for </p>
<p>This medicine is used to treat patients aged 12 months and older with the following rare disorders: 
* Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome 
* processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies </p>
<p>These illnesses are caused by changes in genes needed to make certain proteins. Normal versions of these 
proteins help to keep cells strong and stable. However, the altered genes cause a build-up of harmful forms of 
the proteins called progerin or progerin-like proteins. These harmful proteins lead to cell damage that 
resembles the effects of aging. </p>
<p>How Zokinvy works </p>
<p>Zokinvy works by helping to reduce the build-up of the harmful progerin or progerin-like proteins. </p>         </div>"""

<li>

<p>with medicines known as strong CYP3A inhibitors (these can reduce the breakdown of Zokinvy in the

</ul>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Zokinvy. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor immediately if you: 
* are over 10 years of age. Treatment results can vary depending on the age when you start taking 
Zokinvy. 
* have persistent vomiting or diarrhoea and prolonged loss of appetite or weight (see section 4). 
* start to take the anti-diarrhoeal medicine loperamide. Because of the interaction between Zokinvy and 
loperamide, it will be important for your doctor to provide dosing guidance and monitor your use of 
this medicine. 
* are having surgery. You must not use midazolam, a medicine commonly used during surgery, with 
Zokinvy. Your doctor can provide instructions for this situation. 
* experience increased levels of liver enzymes shown by blood tests. Your doctor should monitor your 
liver function while taking this medicine. 
* develop any symptoms of kidney problems. Your doctor should monitor your kidney function while 
taking this medicine. 
* experience any new visual changes. Your doctor should monitor your vision and eye health while 
taking this medicine. 
* are taking a medicine that is a moderate or strong CYP3A inducer. These types of medicines should be 
avoided (see Other medicines and Zokinvy, below). 
* are taking a medicine that is a moderate CYP3A inhibitor. Adding Zokinvy to an existing treatment 
with these types of medicines requires caution (see Other medicines and Zokinvy, below). 
* have a known dysfunctional polymorphism in CYP3A4. * have a progeroid syndrome caused by a mutation in a gene other than LMNA or ZMPSTE24 and do not 
cause a build-up of the harmful proteins called progerin or progerin-like proteins. Zokinvy is not 
expected to be effective for these types of progeroid syndromes. Examples of progeroid syndromes 
that Zokinvy is not expected to provide benefit include, Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome, 
Rothmund Thomson syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy 
and ataxia-telangiectasia. </p>
<p>Children </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children under 12 months of age because it has not been studied in this age 
group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zokinvy </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Some medicines may interact with Zokinvy when taken together. The following medicines must not be 
taken with Zokinvy: 
* medicines that are strong CYP3A inhibitors (they can reduce the breakdown of Zokinvy in the body, 
leading to more side effects; ask your pharmacist or doctor if any of your other medicines are of this 
kind) 
* midazolam (used to treat seizures and for surgical procedures - tell your doctor you are taking Zokinvy 
if you are planning to have surgery) 
* atorvastatin, lovastatin or simvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) </p>
<p>The following medicines require caution when taken with Zokinvy: </p>
<ul>
<li>medicines that are moderate CYP3A inhibitors (adding Zokinvy to an existing treatment with this 
kind of medicines requires caution; ask your pharmacist or doctor if any of your other medicines are of 
this kind). If you are already taking this kind of medicine your doctor may reduce your starting dose of 
Zokinvy. </li>
<li>medicines that are strong, moderate or weak CYP3A inducers (these can increase the breakdown of 
Zokinvy in the body, making the medicine less effective; ask your pharmacist or doctor if any of your 
other medicines are of this kind) </li>
<li>loperamide (used to treat diarrhoea). The dose of loperamide should not exceed 1 mg daily. Children 
less than 2 years of age should not take loperamide. </li>
<li>metformin (used to treat type 2 diabetes) </li>
<li>medicines that are CYP2C19 substrates (ask your pharmacist or doctor if any of your other medicines 
are of this kind). If you must take a CYP2C19 substrate, your doctor may need to adjust your dose of 
the CYP2C19 substrate and monitor your side effects more closely. </li>
<li>St. John s wort or St. John s wort-containing products (a herbal medicine used to treat mild 
depression) </li>
<li>medicines that are P-glycoprotein substrates (ask your pharmacist or doctor if any of your other 
medicines are this kind). If you must take a P-glycoprotein substrate, your doctor may need to adjust 
your dose of the P-glycoprotein substrate and monitor your side effects more closely. </li>
<li>medicines that are OCT1 substrates (ask your pharmacist or doctor if any of your other medicines are 
this kind) </li>
<li>oral contraceptives </li>
</ul>
<p>Zokinvy with food and drink </p>
<p>Do not take Zokinvy with foods or drinks that contain grapefruit, cranberries, pomegranates, or Seville 
(bitter) orange (such as orange marmalade). Foods or drinks containing these fruits may increase the side 
effects of Zokinvy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility </p>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Zokinvy has not been tested in pregnant women. </p>
<p>Zokinvy is not recommended during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Females of childbearing potential must use effective contraception while taking Zokinvy and for at least 
1 week after the final dose. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must use effective 
contraception while taking Zokinvy and for at least 3 months after the final dose. Add a barrier method of 
contraception if systemic steroids are used for contraception. </p>
<p>It is not known if Zokinvy passes into breast milk and could affect a breast-fed baby. If you wish to breast 
feed, discuss the benefits and possible risks of doing so or of stopping Zokinvy with your doctor first. </p>
<p>It is not yet known if this medicine affects fertility in men or women. </p>
<p>Driving and using tools or machines </p>
<p>Zokinvy has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue may occur following 
administration of Zokinvy. </p>
<p>Zokinvy contains sodium </p>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially  sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""
