Zolgensma is a type of medicine called a ‘gene therapy’. It contains the active substance 
onasemnogene abeparvovec, which contains human genetic material. </p>
<p>What Zolgensma is used for 
Zolgensma is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare, serious inherited disease. </p>
<p>How Zolgensma works 
SMA occurs when there is a missing or abnormal version of a gene needed to make an essential 
protein called ‘Survival Motor Neuron’ (SMN) protein. Lack of SMN protein causes nerves that 
control muscles (motor neurons) to die. This results in muscles becoming weak and wasting away, 
with eventual loss of movement. </p>
<p>This medicine works by supplying a fully functioning copy of the SMN gene which then helps the 
body produce enough SMN protein. The gene is delivered into the cells where it is needed using a 
modified virus that does not cause disease in humans. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Your child’s doctor will check for antibodies before treatment to help decide if this medicine is 
suitable for your child. </p>
<p>Liver problems 
Talk to your child’s doctor or nurse before this medicine is given if your child has had any liver 
problems. This medicine can lead to an increase in enzymes (proteins found within the body) produced 
by the liver or injury to the liver. Injury to the liver can lead to serious outcomes, including liver 
failure and death. Possible signs you need to look out for after your child is given this medicine 
include vomiting, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), or reduced alertness 
(see section 4 for more information). Tell your child’s doctor straightaway if you notice your child 
develops any symptoms suggestive of injury to the liver. </p>
<p>Your child will have a blood test to check how well the liver is working before starting treatment with 
Zolgensma. Your child will also have regular blood tests for at least 3 months after treatment to 
monitor for increases in liver enzymes. </p>
<p>Infection 
An infection (e.g. cold, flu or bronchiolitis) before or after Zolgensma treatment may lead to more 
serious complications. Caregivers and close contacts with the patient should follow infection 
prevention practices (e.g. hand hygiene, coughing/sneezing etiquette, limiting potential contacts). You 
need to look out for signs of an infection such as coughing, wheezing, sneezing, runny nose, sore 
throat or fever. Tell your child’s doctor straightaway if you notice your child develops any symptoms 
suggestive of infection before or after Zolgensma treatment. </p>
<p>Regular blood tests 
This medicine can lower blood-platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). You need to look out for possible 
signs of a low blood-platelet count after your child is given Zolgensma such as abnormal bruising or 
bleeding (see section 4 for more information). Most of the reported cases of a low blood-platelet count 
occurred within the first two weeks after the child was given Zolgensma. </p>
<p>Zolgensma can raise levels of a heart protein called troponin-I that may indicate injury to the heart. 
You need to look out for possible signs of heart problems after your child is given this medicine, such 
as pale grey or blue skin colour, difficulty in breathing, swelling of the arms and legs or of the belly 
(see section 4 for more information). </p>
<p>Before starting treatment with Zolgensma, your child will have a blood test to check the amount of 
blood cells (including red blood cells and platelets), as well as troponin-I level in their body. They will 
also have a blood test to check their creatinine level, which is an indicator of how the kidneys are 
working. Your child will also have regular blood tests for a period of time after treatment to monitor 
for changes in platelets and troponin-I levels. </p>
<p>Abnormal clotting of blood in small blood vessels (thrombotic microangiopathy) 
There have been reports of patients developing thrombotic microangiopathy generally within the first 
two weeks after Zolgensma treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy is accompanied by a decrease in 
red blood cells and cells involved in clotting (platelets) and can be fatal. These blood clots could affect 
your child’s kidneys. Your child’s doctor may want to check your child’s blood (platelet counts) and 
blood pressure. Possible signs you need to look out for after your child is given Zolgensma include 
bruising easily, seizures (fits) or decrease in urine output (see section 4 for more information). Seek 
urgent medical attention if your child develops any of these signs. </p>
<p>Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation 
After your child has been treated with Zolgensma, they will not be able to donate blood, organs, 
tissues or cells. This is because Zolgensma is a gene therapy medicine. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zolgensma 
Tell your child’s doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. </p>
<p>Prednisolone 
Your child will also be given a corticosteroid medicine such as prednisolone for about 2 months or 
longer (see also section 3) as part of Zolgensma treatment. The corticosteroid medicine will help 
manage any increase in liver enzymes that your child could develop after being given Zolgensma. </p>
<p>Vaccinations 
As corticosteroids can affect the body’s immune (defense) system, your child’s doctor may decide to 
delay giving some vaccinations while your child is receiving corticosteroid treatment. Talk to your 
child’s doctor or nurse if you have any questions. </p>
<p>Zolgensma contains sodium 
This medicine contains 4.6 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.23% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Each 5.5-mL vial contains 25.3 mg sodium, and 
each 8.3-mL vial contains 38.2 mg sodium. </p>
<p>Additional information for parents/caregiver </p>
<p>Advanced SMA 
Zolgensma can rescue living motor neurons, but does not rescue dead motor neurons. Children with 
less severe symptoms of SMA (such as absent reflexes or reduced muscle tone) may have sufficient 
living motor neurons to benefit significantly from Zolgensma treatment. Zolgensma may not work as 
well in children with severe muscle weakness or paralysis, breathing problems or who are not able to 
swallow, or in children who have significant malformations (such as heart defects), including patients 
with SMA Type 0, as there may be limited potential improvement after treatment with Zolgensma. 
Your child’s doctor will decide if your child should be given this medicine. </p>
<p>Risk of tumours associated with potential insertion into the DNA 
There is a possibility that therapies such as Zolgensma can insert into the DNA of human body cells. 
As a consequence, Zolgensma could contribute to a risk of tumours because of the nature of the 
medicine. You should discuss this with your child’s doctor. In the event of a tumour, your child’s 
doctor may take a sample for further evaluation. </p>
<p>Hygiene care 
The active substance in Zolgensma may temporarily be excreted through your child’s bodily waste; 
this is called ‘shedding’. Parents and caregivers should follow good hand-hygiene for up to 1 month 
after your child is given Zolgensma. Wear protective gloves when coming into direct contact with 
your child’s bodily fluids or waste and wash hands thoroughly afterwards with soap and warm running 
water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Double bags should be used to dispose of soiled nappies and 
other waste. Disposable nappies may still be disposed of in household waste. </p>
<p>You should continue to follow these instructions for at least 1 month after your child’s treatment with 
Zolgensma. Talk to your child’s doctor or nurse if you have any questions. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Your child will be given corticosteroid treatment daily for about 2 months after the dose of 
Zolgensma, or until your child’s liver enzymes decrease to an acceptable level. The doctor will slowly
