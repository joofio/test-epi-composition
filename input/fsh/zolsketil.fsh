<p>ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is used to treat cancer of the breast in patients at risk for heart 
problems. ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is also used to treat cancer of the ovary. It is used to kill 
cancer cells, shrink the size of the tumour, delay the growth of the tumour, and extend your survival. </p>
<p>ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is also used in combination with another medicine, bortezomib, to 
treat multiple myeloma (a cancer of the blood) in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. </p>
<p>ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is also used to produce an improvement in your Kaposi s sarcoma 
including flattening, lightening and even shrinkage of the cancer. Other symptoms of Kaposi s 
sarcoma, such as swelling around the tumour, may also improve or disappear. </p>
<p>ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal contains a medicine which is able to interact with cells in such a 
way as to selectively kill cancer cells. The doxorubicin hydrochloride in ZOLSKETIL pegylated 
liposomal is enclosed in tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes which help to deliver the medicinal 
product from the blood stream to the cancerous tissue rather than healthy normal tissue. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions 
You should tell your doctor about any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are receiving any treatment for heart disease or liver disease; </li>
<li>if you are diabetic, because ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal contains sugar which may require 
an adjustment to the treatment of your diabetes; </li>
<li>if you have Kaposi s sarcoma and have had your spleen removed; </li>
<li>if you notice sores, discolouration or any discomfort in your mouth. </li>
<li>if you have bone marrow bone marrow is not making enough blood cells </li>
<li>if you have cancer where bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells  </li>
<li>if you have painful, macular reddening skin rash </li>
<li>if you have leakage of vesicant fluids or medicines from the vein into the surrounding tissue </li>
<li>if you have hand foot syndrome (redness, swelling and blistering (a pocket of fluid between the 
upper layers of skin) on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet) </li>
</ul>
<p>Strategies to prevent and treat hand-foot syndrome include:</p>
<ul>
<li>soaking hands and/or feet in basins of cold water when possible (e.g., while watching television, 
reading, or listening to the radio); </li>
<li>keeping hands and feet uncovered (no gloves, socks, etc.); </li>
<li>staying in cool places; </li>
<li>taking cool baths during hot weather; </li>
<li>avoiding vigorous exercise that might cause trauma to the feet (e.g., jogging); </li>
<li>avoiding exposure of skin to very hot water (e.g., jacuzzis, saunas); </li>
<li>avoiding tight fitting footwear or high-heeled shoes. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6):</p>
<h2>- vitamin B6 is available without prescription;</h2>
<p>take 50-150 mg daily beginning at the first signs of redness or tingling. </p>
<p>The cases of Interstitial lung diseases have been observed in patients receiving pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin including fatal cases. The symptoms of Interstitial lung disease are cough and shortness of 
breath sometimes with fever which are not caused by physical activity. Seek immediate medical 
attention, if you experience symptoms that may be signs of Interstitial lung disease. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is not 
known how the medicine will affect them. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist 
- if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained 
without a prescription; 
- about any other cancer treatments you are on or have been taking, as particular care needs to be 
taken with treatments which reduce the number of white blood cells, as this may cause further 
reduction in the number of white blood cells. If you are unsure about what treatments you have 
received or any illnesses you have had, discuss these with your doctor. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Because the active ingredient doxorubicin hydrochloride in ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal may 
cause birth defects, it is important to tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant.<br />
Women must avoid becoming pregnant and use contraception while taking ZOLSKETIL pegylated 
liposomal and in the eight months following discontinuation of ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal 
treatment. Men must use contraception while taking ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal and in the six 
months following discontinuation of ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal, so that their partner does not 
become pregnant. </p>
<p>Because doxorubicin hydrochloride may be harmful to nursing infants, women must discontinue 
breast-feeding before starting treatment with ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal. Health experts 
recommend that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order 
to avoid transmission of HIV. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel tired or sleepy from treatment with ZOLSKETIL 
pegylated liposomal. </p>
<p>ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal contains soya oil and sodium 
ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal contains soya oil. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use 
this medicine. 
ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say 
 essentially sodium-free . </p>         </div>"""

<p>How much ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is given 
If you are being treated for breast cancer or ovarian cancer, ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal will be 
administered at a dose of 50 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and 
weight). The dose is repeated every 4 weeks for as long as the disease does not progress and you are 
able to tolerate the treatment. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, 
ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your 
body surface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 4 of the 
bortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion. The dose is repeated as long as 
you respond satisfactorily and tolerate treatment. </p>
<p>If you are being treated for Kaposi sarcoma, ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal will be administered at 
a dose of 20 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight). The 
dose is repeated every 2 to 3 weeks for 2-3 months, then as often as necessary to maintain an 
improvement in your condition. </p>
<p>How ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal is given 
ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal will be given to you by your doctor in a drip (infusion) into a vein. 
Depending on the dose and indication, this may take from 30 minutes to more than one hour (i.e., minutes). </p>
<p>If you use more ZOLSKETIL pegylated liposomal than you should 
Acute overdosing worsens side effects like sores in the mouth or decreases the number of white blood 
cells and platelets in the blood. Treatment will include administration of antibiotics, platelet cell 
transfusions, use of factors which stimulate production of white blood cells and symptomatic treatment 
of mouth sores. </p>

- you develop fever, feel tired, or if you have signs of bruising or bleeding (very common) 
- redness, swelling, peeling or tenderness, mainly on the hands or feet ( hand-foot  syndrome). 
These effects have been seen very commonly and are sometimes severe. In severe cases, these 
effects may interfere with certain daily activities, and may last for 4 weeks or longer before 
resolving completely. The doctor may wish to delay the start and/or reduce the dose of the next 
treatment (see Strategies to prevent and treat hand foot syndrome, below) 
- sores in mouth, severe diarrhoea or vomiting or nausea (very common) 
- infections (common), including lung infections (pneumonia) or infections that may affect your 
- vision 
- being short of breath (common) 
- severe stomach pain (common) 
- severe weakness (common) 
- severe allergic reaction that may include a swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat; difficulty 
swallowing or breathing; itchy rash (hives) (uncommon)

blood to the rest of the body, which makes you short of breath and may lead to swollen legs 
(uncommon) 
- blood clot that moves to the lungs, causes chest pain and makes you short of breath 
(uncommon)

rare cases, having low white blood cells may lead to severe infection. Anaemia (reduction in red 
blood cells) may cause tiredness, and decreased platelets in the blood may increase the risk of 
bleeding. It is because of the potential changes in your blood cells that you will have regular 
blood tests. 
- decreased appetite;
