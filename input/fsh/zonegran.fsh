<p>Warnings and precautions 
Zonegran belongs to a group of medicines (sulphonamides) which can cause severe allergic reactions, 
severe skin rashes, and blood disorders, which very rarely can be fatal (see section 4. Possible side 
effects). </p>
<p>Serious rashes occur in association with Zonegran therapy, including cases of Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome.  </p>
<p>The use of  Zonegran may lead to high levels of ammonia in the blood which could lead to a change in 
brain function, especially if you are also taking other medicines which can increase ammonia levels 
(for example valproate), have a genetic disorder causing build-up of too much ammonia in the body </p>
<p>(urea cycle disorder), or if you have liver problems. Tell your doctor immediately if you become 
unusually drowsy or confused. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zonegran if you:<br />
<em> are younger than 12 years old, as you may be at greater risk of decreased sweating, heat stroke, 
pneumonia and liver problems. If you are younger than 6 years old, Zonegran is not recommended 
for you. <br />
</em> are elderly, as your dose of Zonegran may need adjusting, and you may be more likely to develop 
an allergic reaction, severe skin rash, swelling of the feet and legs, and itchiness when taking 
Zonegran (see section 4 Possible side effects).<br />
<em> suffer from liver problems, as your dose of Zonegran may need adjusting.<br />
</em> have eye problems such as glaucoma. 
* suffer from kidney problems as your dose of Zonegran may need adjusting.<br />
* have previously suffered from kidney stones, as you may be at increased risk of developing more 
kidney stones. Reduce the risk of kidney stones by drinking sufficient water. 
* live in a place or are on holiday in a place where the weather is warm. Zonegran can make you 
perspire less, which can cause your body temperature to increase. Reduce the risk of overheating 
by drinking sufficient water and keeping cool. 
* are underweight, or have lost a lot of weight as Zonegran can cause you to lose more weight. Tell 
your doctor as this may need to be monitored. 
* are pregnant or could become pregnant (see section ‘pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility’ for 
further information). </p>
<p>If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor before you take Zonegran. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
Talk to your doctor about the following risks: </p>
<p>Preventing overheating and dehydration in children </p>
<p>Zonegran can cause your child to sweat less and overheat and if your child is not treated this can lead 
to brain damage and death. Children are most at risk especially in hot weather.  </p>
<p>When your child is taking Zonegran: 
• Keep your child cool especially in hot weather<br />
• Your child must avoid heavy exercise especially when the weather is hot<br />
• Give your child plenty of cold water to drink<br />
• Your child must not take these medicines: 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (like topiramate and acetazolamide), and anticholinergic agents (like 
clomipramine, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, haloperidol, imipramine and oxybutynin).   </p>
<p>If your child’s skin feels very hot with little or no sweating, becomes confused, has muscle cramps, or 
your child’s heartbeat or breathing becomes rapid:<br />
<em> Take your child to a cool, shaded place<br />
</em> Sponge your child’s skin with cool (not cold) water 
* Give your child cold water to drink 
* Seek urgent medical assistance. </p>
<ul>
<li>Body weight: You should monitor your child’s weight every month and see your doctor as soon as 
possible if your child is not gaining enough weight. Zonegran is not recommended for children 
who are underweight or have a small appetite, and should be used with caution in those below kg. </li>
<li>Increased acid level in the blood and kidney stones: Reduce these risks by ensuring that your child 
drinks enough water and is not taking any other medicine which could cause kidney stones (see </li>
</ul>
<p>Other medicines). Your doctor will monitor your child’s blood bicarbonate levels and kidneys (see 
also section 4).  </p>
<p>Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 6 years because it is not known for this age 
group whether the potential benefits are greater than the risks. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zonegran<br />
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription.<br />
* Zonegran should be used carefully in adults when taken with medicines that can cause kidney 
stones, like topiramate or acetazolamide. In children, this combination is not recommended 
* Zonegran could possibly increase your blood levels of medicines like digoxin and quinidine, and 
so a reduction in their dose may be required. 
* Other medicines like phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone and rifampicin can decrease your 
blood levels of Zonegran, which may require an adjustment of your dose of Zonegran. </p>
<p>Zonegran with food and drink 
Zonegran can be taken with or without food. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are a woman of childbearing age you must use adequate contraception while taking and for one 
month after stopping Zonegran. 
If you are planning a pregnancy, talk to your doctor before you stop contraception and before you 
become pregnant about the possibility of switching to other suitable treatments. If you are or think you 
might be pregnant, tell your doctor straight away. You should not stop your treatment without 
discussing this with your doctor. 
You must only take Zonegran during your pregnancy if your doctor tells you to. Research has shown 
an increased risk of birth defects in children of women taking anti-epileptic medicines. The risk of 
birth defects or neurodevelopmental disorders (problems with brain development) for your child after 
taking Zonegran during your pregnancy is unknown. A study showed that babies born to mothers 
using zonisamide during pregnancy were smaller than expected for their age at birth, compared with 
babies born to mothers treated with lamotrigine monotherapy. Make sure you are fully informed about 
the risks and the benefits of using zonisamide for epilepsy during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Do not breast-feed whilst taking, or for one month after stopping Zonegran. </p>
<p>There are no clinical data available on the effects of zonisamide on human fertility. Studies in animals 
have shown changes in fertility parameters. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zonegran may affect your concentration, ability to react/respond, and may make you feel sleepy, 
particularly at the beginning of your treatment or after your dose is increased. Be especially careful 
while driving or operating machinery, if Zonegran affects you in this way. </p>
<p>Important information about some of the ingredients of Zonegran </p>
<p>Zonegran contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) and allura red AC (E129) 
Zonegran 100 mg hard capsules contain a yellow colour called sunset yellow FCF (E110) and a red 
colour called allura red AC (E129), which may cause allergic reactions.  </p>
<p>Zonegran contains soya oil. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicinal product. </p>         </div>"""

<p>The recommended adult dose </p>
<p>When you take Zonegran on its own: 
* The starting dose is 100 mg taken once a day. 
* This may be increased by up to 100 mg at intervals of two weeks. 
* The recommended dose is 300 mg once a day. </p>
<p>When you take Zonegran with other antiepileptic medicines: 
* The starting dose is 50 mg daily taken in two equal doses of 25 mg. 
* This may be increased by up to 100 mg at intervals of one to two weeks. 
* The recommended daily dose is between 300 mg and 500 mg. 
* Some people respond to lower doses. The dose may be increased more slowly if you experience 
side effects, are elderly or if you suffer from kidney or liver problems. </p>
<p>Use in children (aged 6 to 11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) weighing at least 20 kg: 
* The starting dose is 1 mg per kg of body weight taken once a day. 
* This may be increased by 1 mg per kg of body weight at intervals of one to two weeks. 
* The recommended daily dose is 6 to 8 mg per kg for a child with a body weight of up to 55 kg or 
300 to 500 mg for a child with a body weight more than 55 kg (which ever dose is lower) taken 
once a day. </p>
<p>Example: A child who weighs 25 kg should take 25 mg once a day for the first week, and then increase 
the daily dose by 25 mg at the start of each week until a daily dose between 150 to 200 mg is reached.  </p>

pharmacist immediately, or contact your nearest hospital casualty department, taking your medicine 
with you. You may become sleepy and could lose consciousness. You might also feel sick, have a sore 
stomach, muscle twitches, eye movement, feel faint, have a slowed heart beat, and reduced breathing 
and kidney function. Do not try to drive. </p>
<p>If you forget to take Zonegran 
* If you forget to take a dose, don’t worry: take the next dose when it is due. 
* Do not take double the dose to make up for the forgotten dose. </p>
<p>If you stop taking Zonegran 
* Zonegran is meant to be taken as a long-term medicine. Do not reduce your dose or stop your 
medicine unless your doctor tells you to. 
* If your doctor advises you to stop taking Zonegran your dose will be reduced gradually to lower 
the risk of more seizures. </p>

<p>Annex IV 
Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisation(s) </p>
<p>Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for zonisamide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:<br />
‘Use in pregnancy’ is an important potential risk for zonisamide. Zonisamide must not be used 
during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception unless 
clearly necessary and only if the potential benefit is considered to justify the risk to the foetus. 
Clinical data on the potential risks of congenital malformation and neurodevelopmental disorders 
associated with the use of zonisamide during pregnancy are very limited and these risks remain 
unknown. The current product information indicates that the potential risk of zonisamide use during 
pregnancy in humans is unknown, however, it does not specifically refer to the risks of congenital 
malformation and neurodevelopmental disorders. It is considered that the product information should 
clearly reflect current available scientific knowledge in relation to these potential risks, to ensure 
healthcare professionals and patients are adequately informed of what is known about the risks 
associated with use during pregnancy. Furthermore, the risk minimisation measures in relation to use 
in women of childbearing potential and in pregnancy set out in the product information require 
amendment. Noting the requirement for women of childbearing potential to use effective 
contraception throughout treatment and the uncertainties about the risks to the foetus associated with 
use during pregnancy, pregnancy testing should be considered prior to initiation of treatment to 
exclude pregnancy, as is recommended for other antiepileptic drugs. Moreover, the product 
information should clearly reflect that re-evaluation of antiepileptic therapy should take place prior to 
conception and before contraception is discontinued, whilst the need for urgent review by the 
patient’s treating doctor in the event of suspected or confirmed pregnancy should be reflected clearly 
in the product information.  The PRAC concluded that the product information of products 
containing zonisamide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for zonisamide the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing zonisamide is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. </p>         </div>"""
