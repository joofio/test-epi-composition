given in the context of outbreaks of zoonotic influenza viruses (coming from birds) with pandemic 
potential to prevent flu caused by viruses similar to the vaccine strain reported in section 6.  </p>
<p>Zoonotic influenza viruses occasionally infect humans, and can cause disease ranging from mild upper 
respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, shock and even death. Human infections are primarily caused by contact with 
infected animals, but do not spread easily between people. </p>
<p>Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus is intended also to be given when there is anticipation of a 
possible pandemic due to the same or a similar strain. </p>
<p>When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine 
can cause flu. </p>
<p>As with all vaccines, Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus may not fully protect all persons who are 
vaccinated. </p>         </div>"""

* if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of 
Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus (listed in section 6) or to any of the substances that may be 
present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, 
kanamycin and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), hydrocortisone or cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath 
and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for 
you to be vaccinated with Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus provided that appropriate 
medical treatment is immediately available in case of an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you have had any allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in the vaccine, to egg and 
chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), 
hydrocortisone or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (see section 6. Further 
information). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have a severe infection with fever (over 38°C). If this applies to you then your 
vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a 
cold should not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could still be 
vaccinated with Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first 
few weeks after vaccination with Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus the results of these tests 
may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given 
Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the presence of immune deficiencies Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus may be 
administered but a protective immune response may not be elicited. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. </p>
<p>Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if 
you fainted with a previous injection. </p>
<p>Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially 
elderly individuals and those with weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with 
underlying long term medical problems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your 
doctor if you have a weak immune system or an underlying long term medical problem.  </p>
<p>In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, 
or may need to be delayed. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal 
influenza vaccines. There is no information on administration of Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus 
with non-influenza vaccines. If administration of Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus with other 
vaccines can not be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you 
should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before receiving this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits 
and potential risks of giving you the vaccine.   </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Some effects mentioned under section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect the ability to drive or use 
machines. </p>
<p>Zoonotic Influenza Vaccine Seqirus contains sodium and potassium. </p>
<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium free’. 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium free’. </p>         </div>"""
