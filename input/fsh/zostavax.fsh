ZOSTAVAX is used to vaccinate individuals 50 years of age or older.
ZOSTAVAX cannot be used to treat existing shingles or the pain associated with existing shingles.
Disease information on shingles:
What is shingles? 
Shingles is a painful, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several
weeks. It may lead to severe and long-lasting pain and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin
infections, weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision can occur. Shingles is caused by the
same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in
your body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus becomes active again and causes
shingles. 
What is PHN? 
After the shingles blisters heal, pain can last for months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting
nerve pain is called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. </p>         </div>"""

Warnings and precautions
If you have experienced any of the following, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving
ZOSTAVAX: </p>
<p>if you have or have had any medical problems or any allergies</p>
<p>if you have a fever</p>
<p>if you have HIV infection
Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients (including
neomycin (which may be present as trace residue) or any of the ingredients listed under section  6)
before you receive this vaccine.
As with many vaccines, ZOSTAVAX may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.
If you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine should be given under the
skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.
Other medicines and ZOSTAVAX
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines
or vaccines.
ZOSTAVAX can be administered at the same time as inactivated influenza vaccine. The two vaccines
should be given as separate injections at different body sites.
For information about the administration of ZOSTAVAX and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
at the same time, talk to your doctor or health care provider.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
ZOSTAVAX should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing potential should take
the necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination. 
Inform your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intending to breast-feed. Your doctor will decide if
ZOSTAVAX should be given.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this vaccine.
Driving and using machines
There is no information to suggest that ZOSTAVAX affects the ability to drive or use machines.
ZOSTAVAX contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially
 sodium-free'.
ZOSTAVAX contains potassium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially

Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to off-white compact crystalline plug.
The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When reconstituted, ZOSTAVAX is a semi-hazy to
translucent, off-white to pale yellow liquid.
Avoid contact with disinfectants as they may inactivate the vaccine virus.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use the solvent provided. 
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of
infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
Reconstitution instructions
Withdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe
into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely.
The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard
the vaccine.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to
minimise loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
