<p>Do not take ZTALMY if you are allergic to ganaxolone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ZTALMY if: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you or your child feel drowsy 
ZTALMY can cause drowsiness or sleepiness, or the feeling of being overly calm and relaxed 
(i.e. feeling sedated). Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ZTALMY if you have any 
concerns about these effects or if you are taking central nervous system depressants such as 
other medicines to treat seizures, opioids, antidepressants or alcohol, as these can increase the 
sleepiness and sedative effects of ZTALMY. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you or your child have had thoughts about harming or killing yourself 
If you notice unusual changes in your mood or behaviour or have thoughts of harming or killing 
yourself, contact your doctor straightaway.<br />
If you are caring for a child with CDD, look out for any unusual changes in their mood or 
behaviour or anything they say that could mean they are thinking about self-harming or killing 
themselves. If you notice any of these, contact your doctor straightaway.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you or your child have a history of alcohol or drug addiction 
ZTALMY has the potential to be abused or used for the wrong purpose. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking ZTALMY if you have a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you or your child have severe liver problems 
Your doctor will monitor you closely during treatment and may reduce your dose of ZTALMY. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ZTALMY must not be given to children under the age of 2 years since there is no information on use 
in children below this age.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and ZTALMY 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. Taking ZTALMY with certain other medicines may cause side effects, affect how 
other medicines work or affect how ZTALMY works.<br />
Do not start or stop taking other medicines without talking to your doctor or pharmacist first. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking any of the following medicines, as your dose of 
ZTALMY may need to be adjusted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Valproate-containing medicines, which are used to treat epilepsy, they may require your dose of 
ZTALMY to be lower; 
Medicines that may reduce how ZTALMY works may require your dose of ZTALMY to be 
higher:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other antiepileptic or anticonvulsant medicines such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital and primidone; </p>
</li>
<li>Antibiotics such as rifampicin; </li>
<li>St. John s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for mild depression. </li>
</ul>
<p>The interaction between this medicine and oral contraceptives has not been investigated. Talk to your 
doctor if you are taking oral contraceptives. </p>
<p>ZTALMY with alcohol 
Alcohol should not be consumed as it can increase the sleepiness and sedative effects of ZTALMY. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before 
taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>ZTALMY is not recommended if you are pregnant or a women of child-bearing potential and not 
using contraception.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not use ZTALMY whilst breast-feeding unless your doctor decides the benefits of taking 
ZTALMY outweighs any potential risks.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
ZTALMY can make you feel drowsy/sleepy. If affected, do not drive, ride a bicycle or operate a 
machine until you feel more alert. 
ZTALMY contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per each mL, that is to say, it is essentially 
 sodium-free . </p>
<p>ZTALMY contains sodium benzoate and benzoic acid 
This medicine contains 0.92 mg sodium benzoate and 0.00068 mg benzoic acid in each mL. Sodium 
benzoate and benzoic acid may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies 
(up to 4 weeks old). </p>
<p>ZTALMY contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains 0.00023 mg benzyl alcohol in each mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions. Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing 
problems (called  gasping syndrome ) in young children. Do not give to your newborn baby (up to 
4 weeks old), unless recommended by your doctor. Do not use for more than a week in young children 
(less than 3 years old), unless advised by your doctor or pharmacist. Increased risk due to 
accumulation in young children. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or 
breast feeding, or if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl 
alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called  metabolic acidosis ). </p>
<p>ZTALMY contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate<br />
This medicinal product contains 1.02 mg methyl parahydroxybenzoate and 0.2 mg propyl 
parahydroxybenzoate in each mL which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). </p>         </div>"""

<p>It is an oral suspension (a liquid to be swallowed). Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much 
(in mL) of the oral suspension to take each day, and how many times a day you should take it. </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate the dose according to your body weight. You may start on a low dose 
that your doctor gradually increases over time.  </p>

<p>It is recommended that you take 3 equal doses throughout the day. However, ZTALMY can make you 
feel sleepy, and your doctor may decide you should be given a lower dose during the daytime and a 
higher dose in the evening to avoid any sleepy effects during the daytime. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are unsure of your dose or if you think it may need to be changed.  </p>
<p>How to take ZTALMY 
* Take the medicine with or shortly after meals 
* If possible, try to take with similar types of food (e.g. similar fat content) so you get the same 
effect each time 
* Do not mix ZTALMY with food or drink 
* To ensure an accurate dose, please use the reusable oral dosing syringes provided in each pack. </p>
<p>Instructions for use </p>
<p>Each single-bottle pack is supplied with:  </p>
<p>One bottle of oral suspension closed with a child resistant cap </p>
<p>Two 12 mL and two 3 mL reusable oral dosing syringes  </p>
<p>One bottle adaptor </p>
<p>ZTALMY is also supplied in a pack with five bottles of oral suspension, five 12 mL reusable oral 
dosing syringes and five bottle adaptors. Please note that the pack containing five bottles of ZTALMY 
does not include a 3 mL reusable oral dosing syringe.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure how to prepare or take the prescribed 
dose of ZTALMY.  </li>
<li>You will receive 12 mL and 3 mL reusable oral dosing syringes in the single-bottle pack. If 
your dose is 3 mL or less, use the smaller 3 mL syringes to take your medicine. If your dose is 
more than 3 mL use the larger 12 mL syringes to take your dose.  </li>
<li>Always use the correct reusable oral dosing syringe provided with ZTALMY to make sure you 
measure the right amount of ZTALMY. Do not use a household spoon. Do not mix ZTALMY 
with food or drink to administer. </li>
<li>Each 3 mL dosing syringe may be used for 16 consecutive days. After 16 days, throw away the 
used dosing syringe and use the spare syringe contained in the carton. </li>
<li>Use ZTALMY within 30 days of first opening the bottle. There is space on the bottle label for 
you to write down the date for discarding the bottle after opening so you do not forget.  </li>
<li>After 30 days, discard any ZTALMY that has not been used, and use a new bottle. </li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing the bottle: </p>
<ol>
<li>Hold the bottle in your hand and 
shake it up and down well for 
1 minute. </li>
</ol>
<p>Always shake the bottle well for 
1 minute then let the bottle stand for 
1 minute so that any foam that builds 
up during shaking can settle before 
measuring and giving each dose of 
ZTALMY. This helps you measure 
the correct amount of medicine. </p>
<p>NOTE: This step is for each dose of 
the medicine. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the child-resistant cap on 
the bottle by pushing the cap down 
whilst turning the cap to the left 
(anti-clockwise). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Puncture and peel off the induction 
seal from the bottle. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: This step is only for the first 
use of the bottle. </p>
<ol>
<li>Hold the bottle tight with one hand 
while pushing the bottle adaptor 
firmly into the neck of the bottle 
with the other hand, and make sure it 
is fully inserted. The adaptor could 
come off and cause choking if it is 
not fully inserted. </li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: Do not remove the press-in 
bottle adapter from the bottle after it 
is inserted. </p>
<p>Preparing the dose: </p>
<ol>
<li>Insert the tip of the correct reusable 
oral dosing syringe fully into the 
bottle adaptor, and with the oral 
syringe in place, turn the bottle 
upside down. </li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that you use the correct 
reusable oral dosing syringe to measure 
your dose: 
* If your dose is 3 mL (150 mg) or 
less, you should use the smaller 
3 mL syringe.<br />
* If your dose is more than 3 mL 
(150 mg), you should use the larger 
12 mL syringe.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Slowly pull back the plunger of the 
syringe, so the volume (number of 
mL) of oral suspension needed is 
drawn into the syringe. Line up the 
end of the plunger with the volume 
marking required, as shown 
opposite. </li>
</ol>
<p>If there is an air bubble in the 
syringe, push the liquid back into the 
bottle whilst keeping the bottle 
upside down, and repeat Step 6 until 
the bubble has gone. </p>
<ol>
<li>Turn the bottle the right side up, and 
carefully remove the oral syringe 
from the adaptor. </li>
</ol>
<p>Taking or giving ZTALMY: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Place the tip of the oral syringe 
inside the cheek, and gently push the 
plunger to release the medicine. 
Do not push the plunger forcefully 
or direct the medicine to the back of 
the mouth or throat. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screw the child resistant cap back on 
the bottle tightly, by turning the cap 
to the right (clockwise). You do not 
need to remove the bottle adaptor; 
the cap will fit over it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash the oral syringe immediately 
after use.  Remove the plunger from 
the barrel of the syringe, and rinse 
both parts using room temperature 
tap water.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Warning:<br />
Do not use bleach or any other 
harsh cleaning solutions. 
Do not wash the oral syringe in a 
dishwasher. </p>
<ol>
<li>Shake off any water from both 
syringe parts and allow them to air-
dry separately until the next use. 
Make sure both parts are completely 
dry before placing the plunger back 
into the syringe barrel for the next 
use. If both parts are not completely 
dry before the next dose, use the 
appropriate spare syringe provided 
in the pack.  </li>
</ol>
<p>When using the 12 mL syringe 
accompanying each bottle, do not 
throw away the reusable oral 
syringes until the bottle is empty. 
When using the 3 mL syringe, 
discard after 16 days.   </p>
<ol>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3 and 6-12 for each 
next dose. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you take more ZTALMY than you should 
If you accidentally take more ZTALMY than you should, tell a doctor or pharmacist immediately, 
or contact your nearest hospital casualty department, and take the medicine with you. You may feel 
drowsy or sleepy from taking too much medicine.  </p>
<p>If you forget to take ZTALMY 
If you forget to take a dose, the missed dose may be taken up to 4 hours before the next scheduled 
dose. When the next dose is due in less than 4 hours, it is recommended to skip the dose and continue 
with the next scheduled dose.  </p>
<p>If you stop taking ZTALMY 
Do not reduce the dose or stop taking ZTALMY without first talking to your doctor. Stopping this 
treatment abruptly could increase your seizures. The doctor will explain how to gradually stop taking 
ZTALMY.  </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. </p>         </div>"""
