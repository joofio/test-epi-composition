<p>Warnings and precautions<br />
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ZTALMY if: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you or your child feel drowsy 
ZTALMY can cause drowsiness or sleepiness, or the feeling of being overly calm and relaxed 
(i.e. feeling sedated). Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ZTALMY if you have any 
concerns about these effects or if you are taking central nervous system depressants such as 
other medicines to treat seizures, opioids, antidepressants or alcohol, as these can increase the 
sleepiness and sedative effects of ZTALMY. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you or your child have had thoughts about harming or killing yourself 
If you notice unusual changes in your mood or behaviour or have thoughts of harming or killing 
yourself, contact your doctor straightaway.<br />
If you are caring for a child with CDD, look out for any unusual changes in their mood or 
behaviour or anything they say that could mean they are thinking about self-harming or killing 
themselves. If you notice any of these, contact your doctor straightaway.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you or your child have a history of alcohol or drug addiction 
ZTALMY has the potential to be abused or used for the wrong purpose. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking ZTALMY if you have a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you or your child have severe liver problems 
Your doctor will monitor you closely during treatment and may reduce your dose of ZTALMY. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ZTALMY must not be given to children under the age of 2 years since there is no information on use 
in children below this age.  </p>
<p>Other medicines and ZTALMY 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. Taking ZTALMY with certain other medicines may cause side effects, affect how 
other medicines work or affect how ZTALMY works.<br />
Do not start or stop taking other medicines without talking to your doctor or pharmacist first. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking any of the following medicines, as your dose of 
ZTALMY may need to be adjusted: </p>
<ul>
<li>Valproate-containing medicines, which are used to treat epilepsy, they may require your dose of 
ZTALMY to be lower; 
Medicines that may reduce how ZTALMY works may require your dose of ZTALMY to be 
higher: </li>
<li>Other antiepileptic or anticonvulsant medicines such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital and primidone; </li>
<li>Antibiotics such as rifampicin; </li>
<li>St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for mild depression. </li>
</ul>
<p>The interaction between this medicine and oral contraceptives has not been investigated. Talk to your 
doctor if you are taking oral contraceptives. </p>
<p>ZTALMY with alcohol 
Alcohol should not be consumed as it can increase the sleepiness and sedative effects of ZTALMY. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before 
taking this medicine.  </p>
<p>ZTALMY is not recommended if you are pregnant or a women of child-bearing potential and not 
using contraception.  </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not use ZTALMY whilst breast-feeding unless your doctor decides the benefits of taking 
ZTALMY outweighs any potential risks.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
ZTALMY can make you feel drowsy/sleepy. If affected, do not drive, ride a bicycle or operate a 
machine until you feel more alert. 
ZTALMY contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per each mL, that is to say, it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. </p>
<p>ZTALMY contains sodium benzoate and benzoic acid 
This medicine contains 0.92 mg sodium benzoate and 0.00068 mg benzoic acid in each mL. Sodium 
benzoate and benzoic acid may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies 
(up to 4 weeks old). </p>
<p>ZTALMY contains benzyl alcohol 
This medicine contains 0.00023 mg benzyl alcohol in each mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic 
reactions. Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing 
problems (called “gasping syndrome”) in young children. Do not give to your newborn baby (up to 
4 weeks old), unless recommended by your doctor. Do not use for more than a week in young children 
(less than 3 years old), unless advised by your doctor or pharmacist. Increased risk due to 
accumulation in young children. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or 
breast‑feeding, or if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl 
alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called ‘metabolic acidosis’). </p>
<p>ZTALMY contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate<br />
This medicinal product contains 1.02 mg methyl parahydroxybenzoate and 0.2 mg propyl 
parahydroxybenzoate in each mL which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). </p>         </div>"""

<p>It is an oral suspension (a liquid to be swallowed). Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much 
(in mL) of the oral suspension to take each day, and how many times a day you should take it. </p>
<p>Your doctor will calculate the dose according to your body weight. You may start on a low dose 
that your doctor gradually increases over time.  </p>
<p>If you have severe hepatic impairment, your doctor will start you on a lower dose and follow a 
different titration schedule.  </p>
<p>Patient weighing less than or equal to 28 kg </p>

recommended maximum daily dose of 1 800 mg/day given in three separate doses every 8 hours. </p>
<p>It is recommended that you take 3 equal doses throughout the day. However, ZTALMY can make you 
feel sleepy, and your doctor may decide you should be given a lower dose during the daytime and a 
higher dose in the evening to avoid any sleepy effects during the daytime. </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you are unsure of your dose or if you think it may need to be changed.  </p>
<p>How to take ZTALMY
