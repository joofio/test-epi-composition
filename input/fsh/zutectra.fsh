- if you are allergic to human immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6). In particular, in very rare cases of insufficient amount of immunoglobulin A (IgA), 
when you have antibodies against IgA in your blood. This might lead to severe allergic reaction 
(anaphylaxis). 
An allergic reaction may include sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, fast pulse, swelling of the 
eyelids, face, lips, throat or tongue, rash or itching.  </p>
<p>Zutectra is for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection only. Injection into a vein or a blood vessel may 
result in allergic shock. </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment<br />
- if you have been told that you have antibodies against immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your 
blood. This is very rare and may result in allergic reactions. </p>
<p>You may be allergic to immunoglobulins (antibodies) without knowing it, even if you have tolerated 
previous treatments with human immunoglobulins. Particularly if you do not have enough 
immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood, allergic reactions such as a sudden fall in blood 
pressure or shock may occur.  </p>
<p>You will be carefully observed during and shortly after the 1st injection with Zutectra to make 
sure that you do not suffer from a reaction. If you have an allergic reaction to Zutectra, the injection 
will be stopped immediately. Please tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you 
notice any reactions during your injection with Zutectra. </p>
<p>If you are HBs antigen positive you will not receive Zutectra since there is no benefit in 
administering this medicine to you. Your doctor will be able to explain this to you. </p>
<p>For your own safety you will be monitored for antibody levels regularly. </p>
<p>Possible interference with blood tests 
Zutectra might affect the results of certain blood tests (serological tests). Please tell your doctor about 
your treatment with Zutectra prior to any blood test. </p>
<p>Information on the starting material of Zutectra and the possibility of transmission of infectious 
agents: </p>
<p>The starting material or what Zutectra is made from is human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of 
the blood). 
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include 
- careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, and<br />
- the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections.<br />
Manufacturers of these medicines also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can 
inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also 
applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. </p>
<p>The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The 
measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19 virus 
(causative agent of Ringel rubella). </p>
<p>Immunoglobulins like Zutectra have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections 
possibly because the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are 
protective. </p>
<p>It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Zutectra. So, every time you get a new 
package of Zutectra, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 
"Lot") and keep this information in a safe place, for example your treatment diary (see section 3). </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zutectra 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. </p>
<p>Vaccinations </p>
<p>Zutectra can reduce the effectiveness of some vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, chicken pox) for a 
period of up to 3 months. </p>
<p>You may have to wait at least 3 months after the last injection of Zutectra before you can have live 
attenuated vaccines. </p>
<p>Please tell your doctor about your treatment with Zutectra prior to any vaccination. </p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or healthcare professional for advice before taking this medicine. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zutectra has no or negligible effects on your ability to drive or use machines. </p>         </div>"""

<p>In most cases you will be given the injection by your doctor or nurse. However, if your antibody levels 
are sufficient and you have a fixed dose regimen, you or your caregiver may be trained to carry out the 
injection at home (see below).  </p>
<p>For the documentation of your injections of Zutectra it is strongly recommended to use the treatment 
diary. Your doctor will explain you how to use it. </p>
<p>The dose can be individually established and adapted from 500 IU up to 1,000 IU (in exceptional cases 
up to 1,500 IU) weekly or fortnightly. The dose will depend on your condition. Your doctor will 
regularly check your condition and tell you how much and how often you need to use Zutectra. </p>
<p>Injecting by yourself or by caregiver 
You can inject Zutectra yourself without the help of your doctor, if they have trained you to do this. If 
you are administering Zutectra yourself, please read instructions in the section “How to inject 
Zutectra by yourself or by caregiver” carefully. </p>
<p>Zutectra must be brought to room temperature (approx. 23 °C-27 °C) before use. </p>
<p>If you use more Zutectra than you should 
Consequences of an overdose are not known. However, if you have used more than the prescribed 
dose of Zutectra, contact your doctor, healthcare professional or pharmacist straight away for advice.  </p>
<p>If you forget to use Zutectra 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten injection. Talk to your doctor about managing 
the dose. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you need to use Zutectra. </p>
<p>Make sure you use Zutectra as prescribed and as instructed by your doctor to avoid the risk of a 
hepatitis B re-infection. </p>         </div>"""
