<p>Zynlonta is used to treat adults with a certain type of cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) that: 
* has come back (relapsed) after two or more treatments, or that 
* did not respond to previous treatment (refractory). </p>
<p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a cancer that develops from a type of white blood cell called 
B-lymphocyte (also called B-cell). </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Zynlonta works or why this 
medicine has been prescribed for you. </p>

<p>Loncastuximab tesirine consist of 2 parts; an antibody (a type of protein designed to recognize and 
attach to a specific target) and a cytotoxic agent (a medicine able to kill cells, including cancer cells). 
The antibody in this medicine is designed to attach to CD19, a protein that is found on the surface of 
B cells. When the antibody binds to these cells, including the cancer cells, the medicine enters the cells 
and kills them. </p>         </div>"""

a vein as a drip (infusion) over a period of 30 minutes. </p>
<p>The dose of this medicine depends on your body weight. The usual starting dose is 0.15 mg for each 
kg of body weight. </p>
<p>The table below shows the recommended dose in each treatment cycle. </p>
<p>Recommended dose 
Cycle 
0.15 mg per kg every 21 days 
1st cycle 
0.15 mg per kg every 21 days<br />
2nd cycle 
0.075 mg per kg every 21 days 
3rd cycle onwards </p>
<p>Your doctor may lower your dose if you experience any serious side effects. </p>
<p>Taking dexamethasone with Zynlonta 
During your treatment with Zynlonta you will also be given another medicine called dexamethasone to 
help reduce side effects as a result of treatment.<br />
You will be given 4 mg of dexamethasone either by mouth or into your vein twice a day for 
three days, beginning the day before you receive Zynlonta treatment.<br />
If you do not receive dexamethasone the day before your treatment, then it must be given at least 
2 hours before you are given Zynlonta. </p>
<p>How often will you be given Zynlonta 
Zynlonta is usually given every 3 weeks (on day 1 of a 21-day cycle). 
- Your doctor will give you medicines before each infusion to lower your chance of side effects. 
- Your doctor may stop your treatment, delay your treatment, or change your dose of Zynlonta if 
you have severe side effects (see section 4 possible side effects). 
- Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for side effects of Zynlonta. 
- Your doctor will decide how many treatment cycles you need. </p>
<p>If you are given more Zynlonta than you should 
Since the infusion is given to you by your doctor or other appropriately trained staff, an overdose is 
unlikely. If you inadvertently receive too much medicine, your doctor will monitor you and give you 
additional treatment as required. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Zynlonta 
If you miss a dose of Zynlonta, it should be given as soon as possible. You might need to reschedule 
receiving the next planned dose to ensure that it is given 21 days after the missed dose. The 21-day 
interval between doses should be maintained. </p>
<p>If you stop receiving Zynlonta 
You should not stop the therapy early without talking with your doctor first. </p>
<p>The therapy for lymphoma with Zynlonta usually requires a number of infusions. The number of 
infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to treatment. Therefore, even if you 
see your symptoms improve, you should continue to take Zynlonta until your doctor decides that your 
medicine should be stopped. If the treatment is stopped too early, your symptoms may return. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
