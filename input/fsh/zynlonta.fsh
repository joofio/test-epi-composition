<p>Zynlonta is used to treat adults with a certain type of cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) that: 
* has come back (relapsed) after two or more treatments, or that 
* did not respond to previous treatment (refractory). </p>
<p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a cancer that develops from a type of white blood cell called 
B-lymphocyte (also called B-cell). </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Zynlonta works or why this 
medicine has been prescribed for you. </p>
<p>How does Zynlonta work? </p>
<p>Loncastuximab tesirine consist of 2 parts; an antibody (a type of protein designed to recognize and 
attach to a specific target) and a cytotoxic agent (a medicine able to kill cells, including cancer cells). 
The antibody in this medicine is designed to attach to CD19, a protein that is found on the surface of 
B cells. When the antibody binds to these cells, including the cancer cells, the medicine enters the cells 
and kills them. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Warnings and precautions </p>
<p>Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Zynlonta if you: 
- have an active infection or have had one recently 
- have liver problems; symptoms may include skin and eyes appearing yellowish (jaundice). 
Your doctor will monitor you for side effects during treatment. 
- are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Zynlonta can harm your unborn baby 
(see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding and fertility” for further information). </p>
<p>Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any of the following serious side effects. </p>
<p>Infections 
Serious infections, including infections that can cause death, have occurred in people treated with 
Zynlonta. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have new or worsening signs or symptoms 
of infection, which are listed in section 4, under ‘Serious side effects’. </p>
<p>Fluid retention 
Your body may hold too much fluid during treatment with Zynlonta. This can be serious. Tell your 
doctor or nurse straight away if you have any signs or symptoms of fluid retention, which are listed 
in section 4, under ‘Serious side effects’. Your doctor will give appropriate treatment for the fluid 
retention. If you have serious swelling your doctor may stop treatment until the swelling goes down. </p>
<p>Low blood cell counts (platelets, red blood cells, and white blood cells) 
Low levels of certain blood cells (low blood cell counts) can be serious or severe. Your doctor or 
nurse will monitor your blood cell counts during treatment with Zynlonta. Tell your doctor or nurse 
straight away if you have any signs and symptoms of infection, which are listed in section 4, under 
‘Serious side effects’. Low blood cell counts could be responsible for your infection. </p>
<p>Skin reactions 
Serious skin reactions have occurred in people treated with Zynlonta. Exposure to sunlight (including 
through glass or car windows) may cause severe sunburn. It is important to wear sunscreen and 
appropriate clothing to ensure you do not burn. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get 
new or worsening severe skin reactions. Signs and symptoms are listed in section 4, under ‘Possible 
side effects’. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be given to children or young people under the age of 18. This is because 
there is no information about its use in this age group. </p>
<p>Other medicines and Zynlonta 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. </p>
<p>Contraception (men and women) 
Women of child-bearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with 
Zynlonta, and for 10 months after the last dose.  </p>
<p>Men with partners of child-bearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with 
Zynlonta, and for 7 months after the last dose.<br />
Talk to your doctor about effective contraception. </p>
<p>Pregnancy 
You should avoid getting pregnant if you are taking this medicine. Tell your doctor immediately if 
you become pregnant or think that you are pregnant during treatment with Zynlonta. Your doctor may 
do a pregnancy test before starting treatment with Zynlonta. </p>
<p>Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment, and for 3 months after the last dose. It is not known if Zynlonta 
passes into breast milk. </p>
<p>Fertility 
Zynlonta may cause fertility problems in men, which may affect their ability to father children. You 
can seek advice on how to preserve sperm before starting treatment. Talk to your doctor for more 
information.  </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Zynlonta has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you get 
infusion-related reactions or if you feel tired, weak or dizzy (see section 4) do not drive, cycle or use 
tools or machines until you feel better. </p>
<p>See section 4 for more information about side effects. </p>         </div>"""

<p>Your doctor may lower your dose if you experience any serious side effects. </p>
<p>Taking dexamethasone with Zynlonta 
During your treatment with Zynlonta you will also be given another medicine called dexamethasone to 
help reduce side effects as a result of treatment.<br />
You will be given 4 mg of dexamethasone either by mouth or into your vein twice a day for 
three days, beginning the day before you receive Zynlonta treatment.<br />
If you do not receive dexamethasone the day before your treatment, then it must be given at least 
2 hours before you are given Zynlonta. </p>
<p>How often will you be given Zynlonta 
Zynlonta is usually given every 3 weeks (on day 1 of a 21-day cycle). 
- Your doctor will give you medicines before each infusion to lower your chance of side effects. 
- Your doctor may stop your treatment, delay your treatment, or change your dose of Zynlonta if 
you have severe side effects (see section 4 possible side effects). 
- Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for side effects of Zynlonta. 
- Your doctor will decide how many treatment cycles you need. </p>
<p>If you are given more Zynlonta than you should 
Since the infusion is given to you by your doctor or other appropriately trained staff, an overdose is 
unlikely. If you inadvertently receive too much medicine, your doctor will monitor you and give you 
additional treatment as required. </p>
<p>If you miss a dose of Zynlonta 
If you miss a dose of Zynlonta, it should be given as soon as possible. You might need to reschedule 
receiving the next planned dose to ensure that it is given 21 days after the missed dose. The 21-day 
interval between doses should be maintained. </p>
<p>If you stop receiving Zynlonta 
You should not stop the therapy early without talking with your doctor first. </p>
<p>The therapy for lymphoma with Zynlonta usually requires a number of infusions. The number of 
infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to treatment. Therefore, even if you 
see your symptoms improve, you should continue to take Zynlonta until your doctor decides that your 
medicine should be stopped. If the treatment is stopped too early, your symptoms may return. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. </p>         </div>"""
