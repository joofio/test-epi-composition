   an allergy (hypersensitivity) to olanzapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, a swollen face, swollen lips or 
shortness of breath. If this has happened to you, tell your nurse or doctor. 
* been previously diagnosed with eye problems such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure 
in the eye). </p>
<p>Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given ZYPADHERA </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An uncommon but serious reaction might occur after you receive each injection. ZYPADHERA 
can sometimes enter the bloodstream too quickly. If this happens, you may have the symptoms 
listed below after your injection. In some cases, these symptoms can lead to unconsciousness.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excessive sleepiness </p>
</li>
<li>dizziness </li>
<li>confusion </li>
<li>disorientation </li>
<li>irritability </li>
<li>anxiety </li>
<li>aggression </li>
<li>increase in blood pressure </li>
<li>difficulty talking </li>
<li>weakness </li>
<li>difficulty walking </li>
<li>muscle stiffness or shaking </li>
<li>convulsions </li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms typically resolve within 24 to 72 hours after your injection. After each injection 
you will be observed in your healthcare facility for at least 3 hours for the symptoms listed above.<br />
Although unlikely, you may get the symptoms more than 3 hours after the injection.  If this 
happens, contact your doctor or nurse immediately. Because of this risk, do not drive or operate 
machinery for the remainder of the day after each injection. 
* Tell the doctor or nurse if you feel dizzy or faint after the injection. You will probably need to lie 
down until you feel better. The doctor or nurse may also want to measure your blood pressure and 
pulse. 
* The use of ZYPADHERA in elderly patients with dementia (confusion and memory loss) is not 
recommended as it may have serious side effects. 
* Very rarely, medicines of this type may cause unusual movements mainly of the face or tongue or a 
combination of fever, faster breathing, sweating, muscle stiffness and drowsiness or sleepiness.  If 
this happens after you have been given ZYPADHERA, tell your doctor or nurse immediately.<br />
<em> Weight gain has been seen in patients taking ZYPADHERA. You and your doctor should check 
your weight regularly. Consider referral to a dietician or help with a diet plan if necessary. 
* High blood sugar and high levels of fat (triglycerides and cholesterol) have been seen in patients 
taking ZYPADHERA. Your doctor should do blood tests to check blood sugar and certain fat levels 
before you start taking ZYPADHERA and regularly during treatment.<br />
</em> Tell the doctor if you or someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as medicines like 
these have been associated with formation of blood clots. </p>
<p>Tell your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following applies to you: 
* Stroke or  mini  stroke (temporary symptoms of stroke) 
* Parkinson s disease 
* Prostate problems 
* A blocked intestine (Paralytic ileus) 
* Liver or kidney disease 
* Blood disorders<br />
<em> A recent heart attack, heart disease, sick sinus syndrome, (abnormal heart rhythms), 
unstable angina or low blood pressure 
* Diabetes<br />
</em> Seizures 
* If you know that you may have salt depletion as a result of prolonged severe diarrhoea 
and vomiting (being sick) or usage of diuretics (water tablets) </p>
<p>As a routine precaution, if you are over 65 years your doctor may monitor your blood pressure. </p>
<p>ZYPADHERA is not recommended to be started if you are over 75 years. </p>
<p>Children and adolescents 
ZYPADHERA is not for patients who are under 18 years. </p>
<p>Other medicines and ZYPADHERA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  </p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking: 
* medicines for Parkinson s disease. 
* carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic and mood stabiliser), fluvoxamine (an antidepressant) or 
ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic) - it may be necessary to change your ZYPADHERA dose. </p>
<p>If you are already taking antidepressants, medicines for anxiety or to help you sleep (tranquillisers), you 
may feel drowsy if ZYPADHERA is given. </p>
<p>ZYPADHERA with alcohol 
Do not drink any alcohol if you have been given ZYPADHERA as together with alcohol it may make 
you feel drowsy. </p>
<p>Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this injection. <br />
You should not be given this injection if you are breast-feeding as small amounts of olanzapine can pass 
into breast milk. </p>
<p>The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, of mothers that have used ZYPAHDERA in the 
last trimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, 
sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops any of these 
symptoms you may need to contact your doctor. </p>
<p>Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or operate machinery for the remainder of the day after each injection.  </p>
<p>ZYPADHERA contains sodium 
After reconstitution this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say 
essentially sodium-free. </p>         </div>"""

following administration of ZYPADHERA. </p>
<p>Other very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) include weight gain; and 
increases in levels of prolactin in the blood. In the early stages of treatment, some people may feel 
dizzy or faint (with a slow heart rate), especially when getting up from a lying or sitting position. This 
will usually pass on its own but if it does not, tell your doctor. 
Other common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) include changes in the levels of some 
blood cells, circulating fats and in early treatment, temporary increases in liver enzymes; increases in 
the level of sugars in the blood and urine; increases in levels of uric acid and creatine phosphokinase in 
the blood; feeling more hungry; dizziness; restlessness; tremor; unusual movements (dyskinesias); 
constipation; dry mouth; rash; loss of strength; extreme tiredness; water retention leading to swelling of 
the hands, ankles or feet; fever; joint pain; and sexual dysfunctions such as decreased libido in males 
and females or erectile dysfunction in males. </p>

in the mouth and throat, itching; rash); diabetes or the worsening of diabetes, occasionally associated 
with ketoacidosis (ketones in the blood and urine) or coma; seizures, usually associated with a history of 
seizures (epilepsy); muscle stiffness or spasms (including eye movements); restless legs syndrome;

abnormal rhythms of the heart; sudden unexplained death; inflammation of the pancreas causing severe 
stomach pain, fever and sickness; liver disease appearing as yellowing of the skin and white parts of the 
eyes; muscle disease presenting as unexplained aches and pains; and prolonged and/or painful erection. </p>
<p>Very rare side effects include serious allergic reactions such as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).  DRESS appears initially as flu-like symptoms with a rash on the face 
and then with an extended rash, high temperature, enlarged lymph nodes, increased levels of liver 
enzymes seen on blood tests and an increase in a type of white blood cells (eosinophilia). </p>
<p>While taking olanzapine, elderly patients with dementia may suffer from stroke, pneumonia, urinary 
incontinence, falls, extreme tiredness, visual hallucinations, a rise in body temperature, redness of the 
skin and have trouble walking. Some fatal cases have been reported in this particular group of patients. </p>
<p>In patients with Parkinson's disease oral olanzapine may worsen the symptoms. </p>
