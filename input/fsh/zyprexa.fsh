called antipsychotics and is used to treat the following conditions: 
  Schizophrenia, a disease with symptoms such as hearing, seeing or sensing things which are not 
there, mistaken beliefs, unusual suspiciousness, and becoming withdrawn. People with this 
disease may also feel depressed, anxious or tense.
