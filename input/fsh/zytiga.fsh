that has spread to other parts of the body. ZYTIGA stops your body from making testosterone; this can 
slow the growth of prostate cancer.
When ZYTIGA is prescribed for the early stage of disease where it is still responding to hormone 
therapy, it is used with a treatment that lowers testosterone (androgen deprivation therapy).
When you take this medicine your doctor will also prescribe another medicine called prednisone or 
prednisolone. This is to lower your chances of getting high blood pressure, having too much water in 
your body (fluid retention), or having reduced levels of a chemical known as potassium in your blood.</p>         </div>"""

<p>if you are allergic to abiraterone acetate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).
-
if you are a woman, especially if pregnant. ZYTIGA is for use in male patients only.
-
if you have severe liver damage.
-
in combination with Ra-223 (which is used to treat prostate cancer).
Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine:
-
if you have liver problems
-
if you have been told you have high blood pressure or heart failure or low blood potassium (low 
blood potassium may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems)
-
if you have had other heart or blood vessel problems
-
if you have an irregular or rapid heart rate
-
if you have shortness of breath
-
if you have gained weight rapidly
-
if you have swelling in the feet, ankles, or legs
-
if you have taken a medicine known as ketoconazole in the past for prostate cancer
-
about the need to take this medicine with prednisone or prednisolone
-
about possible effects on your bones
-
if you have high blood sugar.
Tell your doctor if you have been told you have any heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart 
rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or are being treated with medicines for these conditions.
Tell your doctor if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or severe nausea or 
vomiting, as these could be signs or symptoms of liver problems. Rarely, failure of the liver to 
function (called acute liver failure) may occur, which can lead to death.
Decrease in red blood cells, reduced sex drive (libido), muscle weakness and/or muscle pain may 
occur.
ZYTIGA must not be given in combination with Ra-223 due to a possible increase in the risk of bone 
fracture or death. 
If you plan to take Ra-223 following treatment with ZYTIGA and prednisone/prednisolone, you must 
wait 5 days before starting treatment with Ra-223. If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this 
medicine.
Blood monitoring
ZYTIGA may affect your liver, and you may not have any symptoms. When you are taking this 
medicine, your doctor will check your blood periodically to look for any effects on your liver.
Children and adolescents
This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents. If ZYTIGA is accidentally ingested by a child 
or adolescent, go to the hospital immediately and take the package leaflet with you to show to the 
emergency doctor.
Other medicines and ZYTIGA
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is important because ZYTIGA may increase the effects of a number of medicines 
including heart medicines, tranquilisers, some medicines for diabetes, herbal medicines (e.g., 
St John s wort) and others. Your doctor may want to change the dose of these medicines. Also, some 
medicines may increase or decrease the effects of ZYTIGA. This may lead to side effects or to 
ZYTIGA not working as well as it should.
Androgen deprivation treatment may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems. Tell your doctor if 
you are receiving medicine
-
used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol);
-
known to increase the risk of heart rhythm problems [e.g. methadone (used for pain relief and 
part of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), antipsychotics (used for 
serious mental illnesses)].
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.
